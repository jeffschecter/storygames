We are both long-time role-players, and play a lot of story games together.  <br/><br/><b>Setting the Scale</b><br/>We decided on Scale 5: Continent.  We'll want to create characters and powers that can affect that scale.<br/><br/><b>Creating characters</b><br/>We both choose to create characters with Touched super-powers.  <br/><br/>I write that my character is an ex-military pilot, whose plane crashed while he was transporting a shipment of Loa Blood from Antarctica.  Chad asks me if my guy liked war, and I write that no, he hated war, was traumatized by seeing his buddies killed.  <br/><br/>Chad writes that his character is a youngest son who discovered a misplaced cannister of Loa Blood while urban spelunking in the slums of Peru.  I ask Chd about his guy's older siblings, and Chad writes that his two brothers are masons, and one of his two sisters has finished school.<br/><br/><b>Creating Touched Powers</b><br/>I write that my character was thinking "It's so cold" when he was exposed to the Loa Blood.  Chad adds "How cold is it?  (Like a joke)".  I decide on giving my guy the power to project intense cold over a great area.  Chad suggests that the cold spreads slowly, like real weather.  <br/><br/>Chad writes that his character was "bored" when he was exposed to the Loa Blood.  I add "mind wanders", and Chad decides to give his guy the power to project his consciousness into other people's minds.  I ask if this power is instinctual, or takes great effort, and Chad writes that he finds himself along for the ride, where he is needed, and that he can impose his will on his host, but that this snaps him back to his body.  <br/><br/>I name my guy Malcolm North.  Malcolm wants to end all war.<br/><br/>Chad names his guy Marcus Gustavo Perez.  Marcus wants to battle corruption.<br/><br/><b>Creating the Map</b><br/>On the map page, we sketch a rough outline of South America.  I draw Malcolm's plane, crashed in the southern mountains.  I add a jungle with a guerilla army in Brazil to represent the war that Malcolm opposes.  Chad draws the Lima slums where Marcus lives, and the resort at Lake Titicaca that represents the corruption he opposes.  <br/><br/><b>Game Play</b> (I can't remember all the die rolls exactly, but I will try to give them where they are important)<br/><br/>After his plane crash, Malcolm makes his way down the mountain.  Chad adds a new map element, NPC Martha who died in the crash.  I roll on Malcolm's fingerprint and get a 5 on "cold".  Chad rolls on the map and gets a 3 on Lima.  As Malcolm makes his way down the mountain, his new cold power sends blizzards all across the continent.  Meanwhile, in Lima, Martha's mother mourns her death, and her corporate contacts wonder what happened to the Loa Blood she was supposed to steal for them.  We add Martha's grave, and the blizzard, to the map.<br/><br/>Marcus uses his power to observe the effects of the blizzard spreading northward from the mountains.  He convinces his family to leave Lima and go north, to escape the worst of the cold. <br/><br/>I add some bandits on the road, trying to hijack Marcus' family's bus, but I roll a 1 for them, so they are still just thinking about it, following the bus and planning.  <br/><br/>Marcus lets his mind wander on the bus, to learn the cause of the mysterious blizzard.  Chad rolls a 1 on "impose", and just picks up Malcolm's feelings of guilt.<br/><br/>Chad has the corrupt Lake Titicaca corporation retrieve the Loa Blood from the crash site.  He rolls a 3 on "Lima", and adds the cannister and the corporation's helipad to the map.<br/><br/>I have the bandits try to run Marcus' family off the road.  I roll a 2 on "cold", and the bus and the bandits are both stuck in the snow.<br/><br/>Chad acts as the guerilla fighters, and rolls a 4 on "Lake Titicaca".  He draws arrows to show wealthy people from across the continent fleeing the bandit raids and heading to the resort.  <br/><br/>Malcolm, shuts the blizzard off. I roll a 5 on "Loa Blood", and he develops enough to control over his power to return the whole continent to normal weather.<br/><br/>That was our first session.  I'll post more of the story when we have our next session.   <br/><br/>You can see the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/May-Contain-Monkeys/200800523312727" rel="nofollow">map and fingerprints here</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417488/#Comment_417488" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T16:38:00+00:00" title="June 29, 2013  4:38PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I am on the computer in the universe of Starship Troopers And now I am just waiting for that do the voice to be like, "Do you want to know more?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson" title="AllanDotson"><img alt="AllanDotson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/587/nCEFJQOAECTHQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">AllanDotson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417559/#Comment_417559" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T10:38:35+00:00" title="June 30, 2013 10:38AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is that good?  <i>Do</i> you want to know more?  <br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=606&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a brief description of the game setting and mechanics at Praxis.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417565/#Comment_417565" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T11:45:57+00:00" title="June 30, 2013 11:45AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha, yes, I do!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson" title="AllanDotson"><img alt="AllanDotson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/587/nCEFJQOAECTHQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">AllanDotson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419463/#Comment_419463" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-02T16:05:47+00:00" title="August  2, 2013  4:05PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2013 10:06AM by AllanDotson.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We finally played a 2nd session of this fingerprints story.  This time, Chad and I were joined by our friend Lon.  Lon is experienced with both traditional RPGs and story games, but had never played fingerprints before.  <br/><br/><b>Character Creation</b><br/>Lon already had a character concept, and started a fingerprint by writing a few words about David, a Canadian thrill-junkie extreme snowboarder.  I asked if David has a girlfriend, and Lon said he was currently seeing a few people on the rebound from a serious breakup.  Chad asked what David is afraid of, and Lon answered "being tied down".  <br/><br/>Lon wanted David to be Touched, so he wrote a few words about David accidentally finding a secret base of a sinister agency in the Canadian Rockies, and being captured and exposed to Loa Blood.  At the moment of exposure, David was thinking "I've got to get out of here."  Chad added "So many things I haven't tried", and I added "desperation".  Lon decided David can open stepping disks to teleport, observe, reach through, or attack.  Chad asks about their range, and Lon makes it worldwide.  I ask if they are loud or obvious somehow, and Lon makes them glowing portals with a trackable energy signature.  <br/><br/>David wants to explore the world to find himself.  Lon adds "sick snowboarding slopes" in the Andes to represent David, and "Base 03" of the sinister agency that exposed him to the Loa Blood.  We're ready to play!<br/><br/><b>Game Play</b> (again, I can't remember all the die rolls exactly, but I will try to give them where they are important)<br/><br/>David began by accidentally teleporting into another secret agency base (Base 08) in the Andes.  He rolls a 6 on "organization", and narrates that the powerful international mystery organization picks up David's unique energy signature, and is tracking him from Base 01.  I respond as the Guerilla soldiers, and roll a 1 on "cold".  In the abandoned secret base, David finds a small cell of Guerillas sheltering from the blizzard.  <br/><br/>Chad acts as another group of Guerilla soldiers taking the kidnapped Marcus to a safe house.  Lon responds as some other Guerillas left guarding Marcus' family.  Lon rolls a 1 on "cold", and narrates the soldiers talking about the recent blizzard, and how they hate the monstrous Touched superbeings responsible.  They add these new elements to the map.<br/><br/>I add Juanita, the mechanic Malcolm has been staying with, as a new map element, and act as her building a heated suit for Malcolm.  I only roll a 1 for her (probably on "cold", because it's all over our map by now), so she's still just planning, designing the suit, ordering parts, etc.  Chad responds as the Lake Titticaca Corporation (LT), and says they are watching Juanita, because she is really one of their top engineers (cool, I didn't know that!).  <br/><br/>Over the next few rounds, David escapes from the Guerillas in Base 08, and begins investigating the ties between the secret agency, LT Corp., and the Guerillas.   <br/><br/>A few memorable moments:<br/><br/>Marcus becomes indoctrinated by the Guerillas.  I don't remember what word Chad rolled on, but he rolled a 6, for a huge effect.  Chad wrote that Marcus believes "the Guerillas are South America's ... no, <i>the world's</i> heroes."<br/><br/>Chad introduces a new Touched working for the Guerillas, under Marcus' leadership.  "Old man laser eyes" shoots down an LT Corp. satelite, destroying their communications network.  <br/><br/>Malcolm tracks the Guerillas to Base 08 in the Andeas, and creates another continent-wide blizzard to attack them.  I roll a 6 on "cold", so the blizzard is even more powerful than his last one, practically shutting down the whole continent.  Chad responds for the Guerillas (rolling a 4 on "Loa") by having them create more Touched super-soldiers, "Creator", "Ghost", and "Beast".<br/><br/>Lon acts as Creator, the newly Touched Guerilla, who attacks the Lake Titticacca resort, killing all of the rich and powerful people sheltering there from the blizzard.  Lon describes a great scene of carnage, with Creator, now renaming himself "Lumino de Dios" flying through the jungle and firing glowing bolts of energy.  Chad responds as Ghost, the other Touched Guerilla agent stationed at Lake Titticacca.  He rolled a 1 on "$", and narrated how Ghost had sold out the revolutionaries, and joined the rich elite at the resort, only to be killed by Lumino de Dios' rampage.  This was one of my favorite parts of the night's story, because of how a low roll (which only affects internal thoughts and feelings) was an important plot point (making this character change sides and die).<br/><br/>Later, Chad acts as Marcus' family, rolling a 5 on "$".  He narrates how Marcus used his new influence within the Guerillas to buy his family transport out of South America, narrowly escaping Malcolm's latest storm.  This was another favorite moment for me, because of how rolling on "$" could have such different effects.<br/><br/>Eventually, Malcolm makes a direct assault on the Guerilla forces assembled in Base 08 (now their main base of operations).  I roll a 4 (enough effect to destroy this powerful, important map element) on "traumatized".  I narrate Malcolm freezing the steel wall until it shatters, and freezing the oxygen in the base out of the air, but in the process he freezes his own left hand into a useless blackened claw.  Lon reacts as David offering to rescue Marcus from Malcolm's attack (2 or "portal", and Chad reacts as Marcus by abandoning his comrades to flee through David's teleportation disk (2 on "impose").<br/><br/>With the Guerilla army destroyed, and South America locked in an ice age, Lon sends the Beast, the last Guerilla super-soldier, to destroy Base 08 and attack Malcolm.  Lon rolls a 3 (I can't remember what word he rolled on), enough effect for the huge, monstrous Beast to rip open the mountain and destroy the base.  I react as Malcolm, rolling a 1 (internal effect) on "freeze".  So Malcolm just stands there, terrified, while the Beast rips apart the base, but he's a player character, so he can't die yet.  We decide that Malcolm falls into the deepest sub-level, and is buried there.<br/><br/>Fingerprints stories are supposed to last 3 sessions.  I'm looking forward to our next (and last) session, especially to finding out what David and Marcus will do now that they are together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bzarhands" title="bzarhands"><img alt="bzarhands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bzarhands">bzarhands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419888/#Comment_419888" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-11T11:43:21+00:00" title="August 11, 2013 11:43AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2013 11:43AM by bzarhands.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Allan has covered most of the AP details; here are some of my thoughts about the system as relates to these two sessions.<br/><br/><b>Map/Game Scale</b><br/>The reified and shared creative space of the map is thus far my favourite part of fingerprints. I'm not a mathematician, but I want to say that the scale-invariance inherent to the combination of map/literal-fall-of-the-dice allows the game to truly deliver narratives of varying scope.<br/> <br/>Beginning the game with a rough map leaves lots of room for what will happen; ending the game with a hand-drawn artifact of the story as it developed is a treasure.  In-between these points, however, I found myself wanting a detailed, real-world reference document apart from what is drawn.  Place names and physical geography could serve as prompts or simply inform threads in progress.<br/> <br/><b>Action Scale</b><br/>Though it didn't come up in the game, I realized there's two senses in which scale is used within the game.  Any thoughts on renaming this term for the table on page 12?  Something like <i>reach</i> or <i>range</i>, maybe?<br/> <br/>You mentioned a column of generic questions here to serve as further guidelines and prompts.  I think that it would be useful in play.<br/> <br/>Above, Allan points out at least one instance where an Action Scale of 1 yielded significant narrative weight, and I found them fun when they came up. Rarely, though, I found stepping down to a 1 to be disappointing.  It's important (and I assume intended) in the opening game, but might sometimes feel a hindrance as the story is building.  I think powerful example questions here could help, as might a change in mechanics tied to time/pace (ex. during Endgame, you may choose to resolve 1's as 2's).<br/> <br/>Another option might be to expand the definition at Action Scale 1.  I think we were implicitly assuming that <i>knowledge</i> is included in Action Scale 1, and knowing something can be a significant revelation.  <i>Cosmetic</i> might be another eligible category, though it might be tempered with limitation to narrative potential/adumbration rather than out-right indication of something that has already happened.  I'm thinking here of very small things: a change in expression, a band-aid, or a frayed thread.  A related option at this scale would be <i>text</i>: a note, headline, or sensor readout.<br/> <br/><b>Character Generation</b><br/>While I initially felt Loa was too specific a detail on which to base many stories, I realize now that it's an excellent catalyst or narrative shorthand for heroes in the world.  Loa + South America meant that I had little choice but to tag the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goi%C3%A2nia_accident" rel="nofollow">Goi\xe2nia accident</a>.<br/>Agenda is the strongest argument for fingerprints as machine for super hero stories.  What I like most about this take on broad character goals is that they will most likely be informed by the questions asked by fellow players during the free association that defines a Touch.  A formal step in creating Agenda that invited contributions from other players could be productive in externalizing/otherizing the resistance each character faces. <br/><br/>Nothing in character generation suggested whether characters would be hero or villain.  This emerged through play, and at different paces for each character.<br/><br/><b>Game Play</b><br/>I can play my character as much as I'd like, but if I'd rather, I can also play anything else on the map.  I absolutely dig it.<br/><br/><b>Dice</b><br/>Balancing the ability to act at any time with the cost of one did per action works very well. I felt empowered and involved. It also allows for congratulatory intensification; especially arousing actions are marked when all players buy-in for their chance to shape the outcome. This translates to a narrative crux composing one-third of that round's story. <br/><br/>Each player used different sized sets of dice. A meta element for influencing narrative weight might be to intentionally/randomly distribute dice of different sizes. If I am hoping for a larger effect with a certain action in the round, I'll reserve my dice accordingly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson" title="AllanDotson"><img alt="AllanDotson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/587/nCEFJQOAECTHQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">AllanDotson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419953/#Comment_419953" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-12T17:22:24+00:00" title="August 12, 2013  5:22PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2013 8:58PM by AllanDotson.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks or all your thoughts, bzarhands.  I'll respond point-by-point.\n<blockquote><br/>Beginning the game with a rough map leaves lots of room for what will happen; ending the game with a hand-drawn artifact of the story as it developed is a treasure.

You had the idea to print blown-up fingerprint images to write the character "fingerprints" on, and I love them!  (I'll have to post some images, so people can see what I'm talking about).  You could do something similar with the map by printing out a map of the setting (South America or wherever), at 50% opacity, and then making the play map over top of that.  I'd be worried though, that players would use the information on the real world map too much, instead of relying on the information on their story map.  Maybe it would be better just to keep a separate real-world reference map handy, if you need a quick idea for a place-name.  <br/>\n<blockquote>Any thoughts on renaming this term for the table on page 12?  Something like <i>reach</i> or <i>range</i>, maybe?</blockquote>\nReach is a great term for the scope of the die roll, and fits the central motif of Touches and fingerprints.  I will change that term for the next edition.  <br/>\n<blockquote>Rarely, though, I found stepping down to a 1 to be disappointing.  It's important (and I assume intended) in the opening game, but might sometimes feel a hindrance as the story is building.  I think powerful example questions here could help, as might a change in mechanics tied to time/pace (ex. during Endgame, you may choose to resolve 1's as 2's).</blockquote>\nIt's definitely intentional that you roll more 1's early in the game, and fewer later in the game.  Early on, while there is still a lot of white space on the map and the character fingerprints, any die that lands on white space has to be "stepped down" to reach the nearest word, lowering it's number, often reducing it to 1.  Later in the game, when there is less white space on the map and fingerprints, you are more likely to roll 5s and 6s, and have large-scale dramatic effects.  But sometimes you will still roll a 1.<br/><br/>I'd be reluctant to resolve 1s as 2s even in the Endgame, because I think internal effects like falling in love (or out of love), changing your mind, swearing an oath, feeling doubt, overcoming doubt, or having a monolgue are still appropriate and dramatic during the late stages of the game.  Also, rolling a 1 is about the only way that a character can fail in fingerprints, and it gives you the opportunity to narrate why they failed, perhaps by invoking the weaknesses built into your power at character creation.  <br/><br/>I would stress that even when you roll a 1, you should still write a few words about the internal effects of that action on the map or your fingerprint.  You may not save the world yet, but if you have "determined to saved the world" written on your sheet, then you might roll on it next time.<br/><br/>Also, the rules state that the low-rolling player frames a dramatic scene where we role-play the action just described, so that we see all the big world-changing actions from the point of view of the low-rolling character, and they get an in-character monologue or dialogue about what's happening.   We weren't really doing this scene-framing in our play sessions, and I'd like to make sure we do include it in session 3.<br/>\n<blockquote>Another option might be to expand the definition at Action Scale 1.

Let's try it.<br/>\n<blockquote>While I initially felt Loa was too specific a detail on which to base many stories, I realize now that it's an excellent catalyst or narrative shorthand for heroes in the world.</blockquote>\nGood, I'm glad the Loa are working for you.  The Loa backstory is intended to be vague, and just set up a few important features of the setting:<br/>-Super-powers are relatively recent.<br/>-Super-powers all come from the same source, although people might be exposed by accident or by deliberate experiment.<br/>-The advent of super-powers has undermined conventional science, religion, law, and government, leading to a rise in crime.<br/>-The advent of super-powers has also created a wave of new technologies.<br/><br/>The rest of the backstory, about the huge aliens frozen in the Antarctic ice, is color, and not really necessary for the system to work.  I had considered referring instead to a generic "Incident", and to super-powers coming from "the Stuff", but I decided I liked the details of the Loa in the ice.   \n<blockquote>Agenda is the strongest argument for fingerprints as machine for super hero stories.  What I like most about this take on broad character goals is that they will most likely be informed by the questions asked by fellow players during the free association that defines a Touch.  A formal step in creating Agenda that invited contributions from other players could be productive in externalizing/otherizing the resistance each character faces. </blockquote>\nThat's a great idea, and I'm embarrassed that I never thought of it.  Agenda is the only part of character creation where the other players <i>don't</i> get input, and they totally should.  I especially like the idea of other players suggesting challenges / obstacles to the character's agenda.  <br/><br/>Thanks for some great constructive feedback!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
