Now that's a lot of atmosphere from such a simple game.</blockquote>\nAtmosphere, I can see--it has a feel, for sure (and, no, I haven't finished it, if it is finish-able). I'm curious, though--it feels a lot like an action game to me (platforming, mainly, obviously) and it has some atmosphere from the music and the 'stillness' it evoke. But is it thematic in some way I didn't catch? Is it intentionally left vague in setting and situation so as to let the user inform the experience with his or her own projected meaning?<br/><br/>Compare it to <a href="http://armorgames.com/play/5355/immortall" rel="nofollow">ImmorTall'</a> (which you'll "finish" in minutes): that game is purportedly "action" (block positioning, only), but it is quite clearly thematic, in a manner similar to Somalian Children. It certainly made me FEEL far more than Small World did (and is that a gauge of theme? or Theme?).<br/><br/>Discuss, if interested. These games cropping up fascinate me... and I can code a BIT of Flash, so I'm thinking it might be a medium worth exploring for such work (i.e. somewhere between GUI and AVI).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261702/#Comment_261702" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T13:17:31+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  1:17PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've finished <i>Small Worlds</i>.

It's a fine work none the less, I liked it a lot; drama is not the be all and end all of artistic impact, it never was. I don't think that the game is particularly intentionally vague; at least I didn't get any need to invent explanations, as the game's point seems to be in experiencing the poetic toolset it has and then ending.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mortality" title="Mortality"><img alt="Mortality" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mortality">Mortality</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261704/#Comment_261704" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T13:21:07+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  1:21PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find Small Worlds very interesting, because I do struggle with terming it a game in some ways, but for me it benefited from that. It's building on that instinct to explore that has me building scouts by the tonne in Civilization games, and I think a lot of the impact would be lost if it just showed you the images from the beginning (which is effectively all it is doing, showing you these images). And then on top of that wearing a gui informed by platforming games, but simplified to the point where there is little penalty for failing (you can miss a jump, but with a few exceptions you drop to a point where a couple of jumps gets you back there again). There is a story of sorts in there, but it's built of the nature of the worlds you explore, and as you mention open to interpretation. I'll be happy to add my interpretation later on.<br/><br/>ImmorTall on the other hand felt more like a game. A game with a story, admittedly, but I ended up giving up on it when one of the humans died; though I discovered later that wasn't a 'failure', but it felt like one because I was thinking of it as a game first rather than following the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261707/#Comment_261707" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T13:40:51+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  1:40PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, where was the poetry in Small Worlds? (I've actually used the phrase "Poem Game" for ImmorTall elsewhere already.) Or maybe I'd be better off asking what distinguishes the "merely poetic" from the "thematic in the dramatic sense."<br/><br/>On that note, I'm not 100% sure drama subsumes theme--I *think* I can imagine a theme without a drama, using these meanings:<br/><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/drama" rel="nofollow">drama</a> - 3 a : a state, situation, or series of events involving interesting or intense conflict of forces b  : dramatic state, effect, or quality <br/><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theme" rel="nofollow">theme</a> - 1 a : a subject or topic of discourse or of artistic representation  b :  a specific and distinctive quality, characteristic, or concern <br/>(M-W)<br/><br/>Yes, this is semantic, but as the whole point of the thread is, basically, "WTF are these things?" we're going to have to muddle about with diction, to some extent. For me, I see no "theme" in SW; and I see a TON of it in IT. I see a certain... OK, poetry, in SW's music and mystery--it had to be "decoded" somewhat, like allegory-rich poetry. But I think any Theme in SW is a projection (in Freud's sense). The theme in IT has only been missed by one person, whom I saw in its comments on Armor Games ("what's the point?" the poster wrote, to my amused chagrin).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261708/#Comment_261708" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T13:43:07+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  1:43PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew, have you played it where you pay no attention to the humans at all?

It was obvious to me that I was supposed to be protecting the humans, that was what the game was. As I took damage I got weaker, so recognised that as the story bit (sacrificing myself to protect the others) but saw that as more of a background to the game. So when one of the humans got killed when a bomb slipped past me, I gave the game up as 'too hard' because I had failed to do what I thought the game wanted me to, which was the 'escort mission'. I honestly haven't been back since finding out that wasn't a failure (except in my head, and potentially if I was aiming for a specific ending).<br/><br/>A few more games for reference, four toy/games with narrative:<br/><a href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/06/how_to_raise_a_dragon.php" rel="nofollow">How To Raise A Dragon</a><br/><a href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/12/every_day_the_same_dream.php" rel="nofollow">Every Day The Same Dream</a><br/><a href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/05/today_i_die.php" rel="nofollow">Today I Die</a><br/><a href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2008/12/the_majesty_of_colors.php" rel="nofollow">The Majesty Of Colors</a><br/><br/>And two platformers with story (platformer seems to be a relatively common template for these sort of games):<br/><a href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/11/colour_my_dreams.php" rel="nofollow">Colour My Dreams</a> - Easy platforming, relatively standard narrative<br/><a href="http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/09/time_fcuk.php" rel="nofollow">Time Fcuk</a> - More difficult game, somewhat experimental narrative (and yes, that is the correct title)<br/><br/>I think the latter two are a bit more like ImmorTall, and I haven't really seen anything else along the lines of Small Worlds (exploration of a space).<br/><br/>P.S.

The strong revelatory moments of the game (going by memory) are when you realize that the map scales, when you realize the unexpected scale, when you realize what the first world seems like, when you find the second world, when you notice the musical score, when you realize that there is a goal, when you realize the extent of the game's length and when you finally end the game. These form an arc that is not properly speaking dramatic, but nevertheless express a changing relationship between the player and the game. I think that it's fitting to call it a poetic effect, it's similar in many ways to the poetic tensions in a short-form, lyrical poem.<br/><br/>"Theme" is a fine word that can be used to distinguish between the different elements of content in a poetic work as well, nothing against it on my side. The usual Forge context for the term is as a realized dramatic premise, which means that most of the time we use the word in these parts in a specific, dramatic sense. If we're being clear about the more generic meaning, I have no problem calling the ideas of revelation, exploration, grandioseness and harmony in Small Worlds poetic "themes" (a completely normal usage, that). The game is visual poetry with an interactive element in how the player reveals the visions. I recommend it on the strengths of its pacing, conciseness and ability to express the subject matter in a way that I personally find both functional and amusing, due to my relationship to bitmap sprite graphics as a visual medium.<br/><br/>(In case it's a controversial thing about interpreting SW, I'd say that I approached the game as somebody for whom the interactive parts were not a challenge; I've enough of fresh skill in platform gaming that it was not an issue. The game might open in a different way for a comparably clumsy individual who has to struggle to progress due to disorientation or trouble with the platform jumping. I suspect that this would not be a negative facet to the experience, unless the game's difficulty level was really too much.)<br/><br/>Also: thanks for that list of games, Andrew. I'll look into these other games at some point, too - this genre can be annoying (I find <i>Every Day the Same Dream</i> to be rather stuck-up, for instance), but in principle I like its possibilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mortality" title="Mortality"><img alt="Mortality" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mortality">Mortality</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261738/#Comment_261738" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T15:41:59+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  3:41PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another level (emotional/thematic maybe?)

For instance, near the beginning of a level you might see a man fishing at a lake and think nothing of it. As you explore the world you might eventually find yourself going underground, and you might find yourself 1 screen below the lake. You will see the fishing line and no fish swimming around. You might at this point remember there was a man fishing at this lake. It is just color though, but it is reincorporated. Chekhov's color. Eventually you might find yourself deep underground and discover an underwater laboratory. After overcoming the challenges of this laboratory you might find things in the lake and above the lake to be different.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
