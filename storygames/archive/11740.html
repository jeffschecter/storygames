For the sake of argument, let's say it is a swashbuckers and pirates game about swashbuckling and piracy. You have three or four hours to have as much fun as possible. <br/><br/>In this game each player gets handed a coupon book. Each coupon allows your character to do something meaningful and exciting. If you don't have a coupon, you don't get to do it. Some are very specific ("Kill a man") and some are very general ("Impress the crew") and some are meta ("Double coupon! Multiply another coupon's effect by two"). The game allows you to do boring, tedious things without a coupon, but otherwise - no coupon, no action. <br/><br/><b>What would you definitely want a coupon for?

You see, the way this mechanic is phrased, it's not value-neutral; some agendas of play benefit more from this set-up than others. Specifically, it seems to me that a game built like this has to have a major hang-up about characters doing cool things; your task and enjoyment as player is to develop a static character identity which you're then expressing for enjoyment, fighting the other players for spotlight time - princess play, if I'm allowed some jargon. Just like the average Whitewolf game, really.<br/><br/>From this viewpoint, I suppose I'd go for a mystery coupon. Something that allows me to imply a mysterious character heritage and back this up with ill-defined SFX. Those are always geek-cool characters, the ones that stand outside the story, smirk at human pain and swoop in at their pleasure to dictate the Real Truth about the situation. "Reveal a mysterious birthmark." could work in this regard in a swashbuckling genre, perhaps backed by "Prophecy comes true." Also, "Exit a problematic situation handily, accomplishing nothing but avoiding commitment or loss." I'm willing to bet that I could recontextualize a pretty long story with something like those to actually revolve around my character after the fact.<br/><br/>Ultimately this seems a bit problematic as a game mechanism, if I'm allowed to critique. The coupons would have to be written in pretty clever ways to make them both flavourful and flexible, so that the game avoids going <i>Once Upon a Time</i> about avoiding situations where the other guy could "Impress the crew", for example. For a longer game cycle and a larger pool of coupons you'd also have to struggle with the issues of random access data processing; having a large booklet of coupons would potentially suck ass because you'd have to master a large dataset to make good choices. Could be ameliorated by only giving out half a dozen coupons per session, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262010/#Comment_262010" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T08:52:25+00:00" title="March 15, 2010  8:52AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2010 8:56AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys!

Maybe some things you can do twice, others once, and a few things (like basic attacks in 4E), you can do however many times you want.<br/><br/>The main benefit I see from the coupons approach is the opportunity to trade coupons with other players, so I'd want that to be a big thing.  If you need to kill some dude but don't have a coupon for it, I can trade you that coupon for something else.  At that point, though, this might as well be a printed card game, where you have a hand of cards that let you do certain things.<br/><br/>I agree with Gregor that having more than 5-7 coupons at a time is too many to keep track of.  Also, it would make trades more complicated, unless there were specific rules like: you can give someone else a card (which you can't tell them what it is) and get a random draw from their hand.<br/><br/>EDIT: Cross-posted with Jason.

I would be anti coupon-swapping because then you multiply the problem by however many people are at the table.<br/><br/>That being said, coupons I'd like to see:<br/>I think everyone should get one "succeed epicly on a cockamamy scheme/reckless plan" per book. Something that would let you say "I'm going to fight off twenty pirates by myself with nothing but a cane" or something like that.<br/><br/>Also, a "character spotlight" coupon would be nice. I'd be tempted to game it so that you could just have one and then you'd redeem it, say, three times before throwing it out.

There were almost no mechanics other than the cards, except an RPS combat system (3 "hit points" per character and each RPS loss costs 1 hit point).<br/><br/>The cards were things that broke the rules.<br/><br/>Things like:<br/><br/>* Make someone answer one question truthfully.<br/>* Avoid answering any one question for ten minutes.<br/>* You may lie when you answer any one question, but you have to tell them you're lying.<br/>* Completely seduce one person.<br/>* Blow off any other card someone just played on you.<br/>* The next hit you land does 2 points of damage instead of 1.<br/>* Shrug off all damage from one hit.<br/>* Initiative! You cause one point of damage before combat starts.<br/>* You can poison any one item of food or drink that you touch.<br/>* You can ignore the effects of poison once.<br/><br/>They all had clever names like "Iron Liver" and "Lightning Reflexes."

However, I think they would be significantly diminished if they were all that happened. In most sessions, I'd say maybe 3-4 of these things happen. I think the 'unit' of fun is a scene, or a series of scenes that leads to one of these moments and flows in the fiction.<br/><br/>Going to the card idea, I think for these to be much fun (at least for me), I'd need to have a small, random selection of them available to me, along with some less desirable outcomes, per session. Without moments of average success and average failure, I don't think these would be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262325/#Comment_262325" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T12:54:45+00:00" title="March 16, 2010 12:54PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking about my play experiences and "discrete units of fun", I'm thinking that I'd like roughly one per fifteen minutes of play time for each player.

For example, the times I've run Danger Patrol it has been at an incredible breakneck pace of pure insanity, where characters are realigning moons and spawning evil shadow twins within the same 10 minute period. But, unless that slows down at some point and the players are given the opportunity to reflect and recover, you can only do that for about an hour or so (with 6-10 "units of fun" in that period) before you have to quit and wait until the next session.  But if you run it a bit slower, as I imagine most people do, you can sustain the less-densely-packed fun for a longer period of time and might actually have more fun in the long run (even though fun isn't really comparable like that).<br/><br/>Overall, yeah, I think if you pack your fun too tightly it has a chance of seeming gonzo or too artificial.  It doesn't fit within the established expectations about narrative that we've come to expect from novels, movies, television, comics, etc.  Well, maybe comics, but less so in modern comics, unless it's Sharknife or something else that embraces gonzo insanity.  You really want one dramatic situation every 15-30 minutes or so, with cool but not fundamental content happening in between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262352/#Comment_262352" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T15:27:27+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  3:27PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, another thing that happens with gonzo breakneck insanity is that sometimes things realign themselves naturally, with basically a much crazier bar being set for normal and the special "fun unit" happenings standing out in other ways, maybe by their normalcy or by the way they totally go beyond even the normal levels of insanity.  It's like how, in some Nobilis games, destroying some aspects of time itself might be really normal, but having a brief conversation about your feelings might be earthshaking.  So maybe there's a tendency for all play to drift somehow to a "right-feeling" sense of pacing, in regards to your "fun units" (can we call them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus#Hedons_and_dolors" rel="nofollow">hedons</a>?)?

Also, the more meta-effective coupons there are, the better.  I'd like coupons that let me end the scene at a moment that I feel is appropriate, bring in stuff that happens off-screen and author adversity for my peers -- even if there's a GM who normally decides that stuff.  I'd expect a four-hour, four-player game to have something like fifty or sixty coupons.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262488/#Comment_262488" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T09:43:29+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  9:43AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really have much to add except that I played in a long-running game of Hackmaster where coupons have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HackMaster-GameMasters-Coupon-Book-Development/dp/1889182656" rel="nofollow">a whole supplement</a> devoted to them<br><br>Yes, the coupons became the focus of play. You tried to engineer situations that put you in position to redeem your favorite coupon or were sussing out everyone else's narration for an opportunity to use one. Some coupons were minor effects, like a +1 to an attack. Some were quite major, like immediate beheading on a selected target. Still, it was a fun gamey experience.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
