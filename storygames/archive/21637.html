I find myself reading plot summaries of movies I want to watch to make sure they don't suck. <br/><br/>Dramatic irony is already a well known technique in story telling, this seems to prove you can use it to improve <i>any</i> story. After all, historically people listen to the same stories and songs over and over.<br/><br/>I think this knowledge could vastly improve the experience of most railroaded adventures. Someone should run an experiment where the major plot points are spoiled to the players and see if they still enjoy the adventure. At least the stupid struggle to "keep players on the right track" can finally end and without the GM needing to state clearly that "the plot is this way" the players will gladly follow it looking forward to the upcoming "twist".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473362/#Comment_473362" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-05T02:55:14+00:00" title="May  5, 2018  2:55AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2018 2:56AM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember this study. I can sometimes really really enjoy going into something unseen. It has its own thrill to me. Parents, sister, grandma, all the same way. We'd mute the TV if they were talking about a movie or show we hadn't seen. So it was interesting to see that it wasn't universal. I've done some testing myself to see if the ideas in the study applies to me. But it's hard to do that in a scientific way.<br/><br/>All of my favorite media I definitely went in unseen; that's what made the biggest impression on me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473371/#Comment_473371" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-05T07:57:22+00:00" title="May  5, 2018  7:57AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am unable to read the study.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty" title="frenzykitty"><img alt="frenzykitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/557/n6V5J0A17A1B2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty">frenzykitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473390/#Comment_473390" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-05T16:28:49+00:00" title="May  5, 2018  4:28PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is tremendous power in dramatic irony.

Even if it is impossible to say for sure counterfactually, I can think of cases from my own experience where I think spoilers ruined a story and other cases where the spoilers didn't harm it much at all.<br/><br/>Example A: In Game of Thrones, I was spoiled to the effect that certain characters would die in certain books.  But I still enjoyed the books plenty well, perhaps more than without spoilers.  Like Shakespearian tragedy, you can appreciate the dramatic irony as you see the character's mistakes draw them inexorably towards their fates.<br/><br/>Example B: Lovecraft horror stories.  The stories are written to very carefully control how much you know and realize at each point, making you fear that something terrible is coming without being certain what it is.  I found the most famous stories like Call of Cthulhu pretty boring because I already knew the gist of what was up from popular culture allusions.  But stories where I went in blind were thrilling to read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473416/#Comment_473416" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-07T01:01:43+00:00" title="May  7, 2018  1:01AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Lovecraft's stories would be one of my examples for spoilers not hurting the enjoyment. Once you've read a couple of them, you know the pattern well enough that the ending doesn't really surprise, even if you can't see the exact specifics coming. But there's enjoyment to be had in the buildup, and the language, and the imagery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
