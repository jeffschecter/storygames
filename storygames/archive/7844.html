I was playing the Warlock at the time. We had just started and had this vague notion of a Sigil like city, which we fleshed out later.<br/><br/>So we wiped on the second to last encounter, which was a combination of the DM not getting how the level differences and the like work and us as players not fully getting how things work in a group dynamic, which is ironic since we all play MMOs together and are used to the team dynamic of raids and instance runs.<br/><br/>After the wipe, we kinda rebooted. First we fleshed out The City, as it is called. It centers on an Arabian Nights style core and it has been collecting the parts of otherworlds forEVAR... The idea is that it lands somewhere for a while (say a month), then when it hops to another world it takes a part of that world with it making a new neighborhood or part or fucking mountain or river or whatever.<br/><br/>The key commodity in the city is water. He who controls the water (the city center in this case) controls the city. The guys in the city center are rumored to have "doors" permanently open to the elemental plane where they get the city's fresh water.<br/><br/>So it is a kinda moving Sigil basically...<br/><br/>So our reboot is we got captured and sold by the Kobolds to the Shadar Kai... We do a little arena fight to prove ourselves and are given an impossible task to complete with no resources... A complete old school fucking.  Shortly there after I took over as DM.<br/><br/>I started with the loose idea of fixing the mess that the first DM made. The game was not fun really and I wanted to bring the fun back. The whole super powered bad guy making you do what you want for no reward sucks so I started with fixing that.<br/><br/>Using my Warlock and his backdrop (he is the son of the Raven Queen, got booted and wiped, and is now trying to regain power to replace her), he introduced a patron, a powerful Eldarin lord of the city who has plots and plots throughout the multiverse. He hires all of them, sending the Warlock off on one errand and introducing the old DM's rogue to the group for the current job.<br/><br/>At that point I had no idea where the fuck I was going other than out of the city away from the Shadar Kai who would mop the floor with these underpowered 1st level fools. I gave them basic gear, basically what they had before the fucking without a reach around, and sent them through a "door" to another world to settle some trouble for the Eldarin lord.<br/><br/>I grabbed the Scales of War adventure path from Dungeon, grabbed the first two encounters, tried to mod them for my group's level difference, and went to the fucking races.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173792/#Comment_173792" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T08:45:58+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  8:45AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<strong>Encounter 1: Bar Fight</strong><br/>So the first encounter is a fight in a bar. I liked this as a starting point because it had lots of minions, a raging fire, obstacles, and I could easily make it a good encounter by staggering the enemy in waves. I also so it and the second encounter as a good teaching tool for my players. Right out the gate I saw how DnD combat is similar to Mordhiem and the tactical nature of it, but the rest of the guys were stuck in the old school of stand up and fight toe-to-toe like Ali.<br/><br/>So how it broke down is the bar gets jumped by goblins and hobgoblins. The goblins throw some exploding torches which set fire to a square, which then spreads at the bottom of each round in a random direction. The hobgoblin minions mix things up and there are waves of both.<br/><br/>This worked great because it forced the players to think about spacial movement, shifting, opportunity attacks, and what their powers can do. They got a little fucked up and the fire kept them worried the entire time, but it was really a rather easy encounter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173793/#Comment_173793" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T08:46:19+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  8:46AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<strong>Encounter 2: The Tank</strong><br/>The second encounter I also lifted from the Scales of War. It is just genius. You take one 8 level Ogre, strap him to a wagon filled with exploding pitch, put two Hobgoblin archers in the back and you have a fantasy tank. Fucking genius.<br/><br/>The problem though was that my group is three guys, and all these are 5 man encounters. Shit had to change. So instead of modding the actual monsters to make them weaker I did three things. <br/><br/>First took a page from Saving Ryan's Privates, err... Saving Private Ryan. At the end of the movie the Americans use the narrow streets and destruction to fight tanks with an inferior force... So I redrew the map to reflect this... Made it harder for the Ogre to maneuver (and this is before the new vehicle rules in the Adventurer's Vault) and made it a two standard action move to get out of his harness.<br/><br/>Second, I added two scripted events. One is the arrival of a militia at round 8 (level one human minions) with pikes. The second was a fighting retreat by the archers should the Ogre get to 1/3 his hit points.<br/><br/>The third thing I did was brief the players on how toe-to-toe fighting is not going to work. I emphasized this with the first thing being the explosion of one of the Ogre's casks. They got a little in the face and saw the destruction first hand.<br/><br/>With all this going on, it turned into a doorway-to-doorway, window-to-window, rooftop-to-rooftop fight in the streets. It was great. They caught on quick and had a tough but rewarding fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173794/#Comment_173794" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T08:46:33+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  8:46AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 8:46AM by Ken Sentowski!.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<strong>Encounter 3: Rainbow 3, the Super Encounter</strong><br/>So before the session that was encounter 3, I had decided that the Scales of War, while filled with some cool shit, still suffers from some of the old school bullshit and some of the crappier parts of MMO design (I will get into that shit in another post), so using what I have learned playing the game so far, running it, and my experience with what makes a good video game encounter, I built my first encounter and started rewriting the adventure completely (which I will get into with a later post). It is what I call a super-encounter, where it is a bunch of small encounters that feed directly into a larger one.<br/><br/>Back in the day, when Rainbow Six first game out for the N64, I played through the whole damn thing in 12 hours instead of going out to the bar. My friend came over, saw what I was doing and we co opted through the game until the sun was well up overhead. First time I ever passed up going out to stay in and play a game. I loved it and decided that it would be perfect for this game.<br/><br/>So the players, being n00bs to town had their first skill challenge, convince the captain who had the building surrounded, but with limited resources since their was still fighting going on in the town, to let them handle the hostage situation in the council building (where their McGuffin is sitting). I am still working on how to best use skill challenges (coming in another post). <br/><br/>They pull it off but not without seeing a Hobgoblin who seems to be in charge push a woman off the building to her death. He is a 8th level Hobgoblin Minion. A paper tiger, but they don't know that. They just think he is a bad ass and a boss.<br/><br/>So, after the hobgoblins clear the roof, the Eladrin Fighter teleports to the roof and secures a rope (how the fuck do you resolve encounter powers with non-encounter events?). The other too sneak up, not without taking some fire though, but eventually get to the roof unnoticed.<br/><br/>The sentry on the roof is how I introduce my first magic item to the crew, some fancy goggles that improve ranged attacks. I had decided on my own that magic items are like technology. If you can afford it you can have it. The town guards have two way communicators, the hobgoblin guard has fancy goggles, and I will continue to introduce mundane magic items.<br/><br/>So they get in, and proceed to clear the first floor, freeing hostages and keeping quiet. Lots of sneaking rolls and surprise and searching around. They don't find the McGuffin on the 2nd floor of course and proceed to check out the 1st. <br/><br/>I used the Fane of the Drow map from the DnD Mini's game, splitting it into two floors. The 1st floor is open with small rooms and alcoves. I had the McGuffin in the center of the room and other hostages through out, with minions, a big bad, two bodyguards, and the paper tiger. At first glance it looked impossible, but the sneaky build up led to some clever thinking, some good rolls and they overcame it, though it was tough.<br/><br/>I can't tell you good it felt to reveal when they finally hit the paper tiger and he went down to see the shock on their faces and then the smiles at how I pulled a fast one on them.<br/><br/>Next up, what I have learned about encounter design and 4th Edition so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173823/#Comment_173823" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T10:07:18+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 10:07AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Senkowski</cite>how the fuck do you resolve encounter powers with non-encounter events?</blockquote>\nThe idea of 4E 'encounters' is very mechanical, encounter powers are gone until you take a short rest (a term more clearly defined in the rules).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173824/#Comment_173824" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T10:14:18+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 10:14AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I know that...

And then there are non-combat encounters, which are skill challenges, puzzles, and traps.  If the time in between non-combat encounter actions is significant (like longer than 5 minutes) and there's room to rest (e.g. it's not a chase across Rohan, but a political debate over the course of days) then you could have them refresh encounter powers (if they can grab 5 minutes of downtime) or even daily powers (if they can get 6.5 hours of sleep/rest), although you should reduce the XP reward if the encounter is that non-intensive - although I don't know if there are any powers that would really help in a non-intensive non-combat encounter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173879/#Comment_173879" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T12:16:07+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:16PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<strong>What I Have Learned So Far</strong><br/>Now this maybe a little random in regards to the previous posts. I am not going into it in the order in which events occurred, but more in line with how it all relates to each other. So bear with me kids.<br/><br/><strong>Encounter Design: It's Easy as Fucking</strong><br/>Really. It is. There is no excuse for not being prepared anymore. Seriously. Designing quality encounters is so damn easy. I've read and reread the DMG a dozen times now, and combined with the experience I have gained and some principles I follow it takes me all of ten minutes to work one up.<br/><br/>I am sure that everyone reading this has at least an understanding of encounters in 4th edition so I am not going to go into that. Instead let me talk about some basic principles I have latched onto that lead to success with the game.<br/><br/>The first is a simple truth: <em>Learn from Video Games</em><br/><br/>Video games have been creating interesting encounters for much longer than we have. For the most part role-playing games have really sucked at this for a long time. Most of the time an encounter is bland as shit. Select what you are going to do and roll some dice then someone narrates the outcome, be it a swing of a sword or some narrative nonsense. Even in games that use interesting tactics like Burning Wheel, something always seemed lacking.<br/><br/>What it comes down to is three things taken from video games, in particular MMOs: environment, scripting, and and tactics.<br/><br/><strong>Environments</strong><br/>I always start with the environment. Like with Lucas, each session I try to have two/three (depending on how long we are going to play) different environments... radically different if possible. You see this with good larger instance design. The mini-boss encounter is always very different from the big bad at the end of the instance. The mini-boss might require you to destroy objects to keep the waves of minions from coming and the big bad might be in a pool of lava where he tosses you if you get to close when he drops his bomb.<br/><br/>With the battlemat and minis, the environment is easier to deal with than with other games. I don't have to try and describe all the options, they are all there for everyone to see. It is a matter of me selecting interesting things to be used, either by me or by the other players. It can be as simple as table and chairs, something moving like a fleeing crowd, something random like a blazing inferno, or something shit bat nuts like lightening arcs.  <br/><br/>What matters is that the environment is interactive and impacts the tactics of play. The reason Assassin's Creed works so well is that the crowd reacts, that you can knock shit over, climb walls, and push things in the way. That principle is a must when it comes to environment design.<br/><br/><strong>Scripting</strong><br/>The next thing I do is look at the monsters I want to use, the environment and work up the scripts. Scripting is old hat if you play MMOs. Every boss fight has one and these days most monsters have some sort of script. Sometimes it is simple, like cast heal when at 1/4 hit points. Other times it is crazy complicated like the Balrog fight in LOTRO with tons of shit happening based on all sorts of conditions.<br/><br/>If you have ever written code, you know this is an if/else statement based on conditions. This shit is important and I have not found it to work with other games. It is how I can make an impossible encounter possible, easy monsters hard, and it is what makes an encounter compelling.<br/><br/>I think in conditions for several rounds when I do this (around 10 rounds). Who is there at round 1? Does anything need to happen at round 2? At what round should I use my daily power? Is a change in the environment on round 5 a good idea? Who runs away or surrenders at what point? (killing everything in the room isn't always a good thing) Answering questions like this turn a fight into an event.<br/><br/><strong>Tactics</strong><br/>Tactics build on the scripts and the environment. Once I have those in place I build what each opponent is going to do. I work out three basic motivations for a lack of a better turn following these questions:\n<ol><li>What do I do when I attack?</li>\n<li>What do I do when I am hurt?</li>\n<li>What do I do when my allies are hurt?</li></ol>\nMost times I don't write this shit down, just keep it in mind or if I do it is on the post it note in my Monster Manual. Either way it lets me have a guide for the encounter and all the changes in the actions I reflect off those basic ideas.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>While all three of these things can be addressed to some degree or another in other games, no game has come as close to having a concrete way to create such interesting encounters/conflicts.

For instance, if you played through the same encounters in another system, what would NOT have been as cool?</blockquote>\nThe first thing is the viceral nature of having the battlemat in front of you. You can see the fire spreading randomly. It isn't something I am trying to imagine without context. It is right fucking there in front of me. I can see how damn big that ogre mini (paper mini in this case) is compared to my halfling rogue. I can see the destruction he is creating with the building being erased and turned to rubble. I can see ways around a nearly impossible task. This is VERY important for any game that the environment and the use of it is important (like swinging from chandeliers). Plenty of games have stunting mechanics, but like improv, that shit works best with guidelines. The battlemat in DnD are those guidelines.<br/><br/>The second thing is the structured nature of combat. Because I know that there are clear deliniation of activity (three action types a round, powers, ect) I can script for cool events based on conditions in a concrete way. This is a kind of freedom, it lead to anticipation, and gives me at the GM a goal to work towards in each encounter (take the high ground before round 6 when the lower area floods with mud from the avalance).<br/><br/>Those two things alone make this game genius.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173887/#Comment_173887" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T12:29:03+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:29PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keith,<br/><br/>that was a great post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173891/#Comment_173891" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T12:34:19+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:34PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keith,<br/><br/>Thanks!

And it sounds like most of the fun is coming out of your approach to interactive encounter design. What does D&amp;D4 do that's different from other games with battle grids and structured combat?

Even more than The Riddle of Steel, IMO, which used to be my standard for nail-biting combat. The tactics item is just too rich.<br/><br/>A problem that I see is setup: Design is much easier, but setup is much much slower: Finding/printing that ogre paper mini. Prepping the combat map, etc.<br/><br/>How do you feel about that? Any tips to make it easier/faster to set up encounters?<br/><br/>Also, scripting? Genius. Did I miss that in the DMG? I don't remember seeing much on scripting as you stated (Event X happens on Round Y, etc).<br/><br/>I've got an idea that might increase player tension.<br/><br/>Plan a few "X happens on round Y" encounters.<br/>If you have index cards, on one side write down what happens. On the opposite side, simply write the Number of the Round where they go off. Turn them face-down, leave then next to the map for all to see.<br/><br/>I figure that'll increase the tension, the players seeing that in 2 rounds, "SOMETHING" is going to happen, and they don't know if it's going to be good or bad.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173922/#Comment_173922" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T14:23:00+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  2:23PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff, and it really mirrors my own experiences. <br/><br/>One thing I've noticed is that not only should the terrain be different in different encounters, it should effect the flow of battle in different ways. I ran my first real session of 4E a week ago (as in not from a published adventure), and I cooked up two combats, both of which were fun and the second was a real nailbiter. The one thing I realized afterwards was that both had given a big advantage to ranged combat, leaving defender types feeling a little less useful. One had an ambush with the real badguys on the ledge above the road, another had some fire creatures of a (moving) lava flow. They felt very different in many ways, but in the end both of them favored ranged combat. Sounds like you'r better at balancing that kind of stuff then I am, but it's something I've noticed.<br/><br/>As far as prep, here's what I've been doing:<br/><br/>Get a grid map that you can draw on. I have a paizo double sided poster one, which is pretty good, it just doesn't lay quite perfectly flat, but it does support dry erase (which some other mats don't). Have markers and erasers handy.<br/><br/>I draw out the most likely starting configuration for the badguys on a small grid on a sheet of paper (I have a template with four grids plus note space per page). This isn't set in stone, but it helps me decide what is smart for the badguys, so that if the PCs do mix things up I know what's advantageous for me.<br/><br/>I have paper tokens I printed out from Firey Dragon ($10 or so for a PDF of all the MM monsters through 10th level). I print them on heavy weight paper (around 50 or so, Iif I recall correctly), printing only ones I think I'll need, and put them into encounter groups before play. I have similar tokens for the PCs, each PC also has a 'mark' color that we can use during combat to indicate marks.<br/><br/>With all of that, plus a page of notes, combat's a sinch.<br/><br/>Now, you probably don't need all that, but I've found it works for me. I like to plan, but if I plan plots I'm rarely as happy with the, so I sketch plots and plan encounters.<br/><br/>One thing I've been working on is a good system for noting marks, conditions, and bloodied. I was working on a solution using 1 inch metal rings and electrical tape, but it doesn't work as well as I'd like. I'm dreaming of something kind of like a poker chip with a hollow center, in enough different colors to indicate marks, conditions, bloodied, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173948/#Comment_173948" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T15:39:07+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  3:39PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is some interesting stuff here, which ties into my own experiences, not with 4E (which I've not played) but with games like GURPS (where I have also used battle maps, miniatures, scripts, terrain and the like).

First I want to add this while it is fresh in my head...<br/><br/><strong>The Grind</strong><br/>So, a big part of any level driven game is the process of gaining experience. Video games, and in particular MMOs have adopted this philosophy, but have taken it to another level. Grinding out levels... Killing things over and over again to gain experience (so you can go raiding like I am this week, Balrog here I fucking come).<br/><br/>This sucks in MMOs and it sucks in DnD. The scale is different, but it is the same shit. In MMOs you kill a ton of shit to get your XP. People will move through a zone killing monster after monster after monster, return to town to sell the drops and then head back out.... For fucking hours.<br/><br/>In Dungeons and Dragons you get the same thing but on a smaller scale. Traditionally we march are band of morons into a dungeon, moving from room to room clearing shit. It is tiresome, tedious, and often times mind boggling (why the fuck are the goblins living with a pack of stirges in their home?). This "tradition" continues today in modules, and if I ran my game like they create adventures it would take us months to get to the boss fight. I don't have that kind of patience.<br/><br/>The solution is to cut that shit the right fuck out of the game. Clearing room to room maybe fine for an instance on an MMO where the computer does most of the heavy lifting (though that shit gets tiresome too), but for a table top game it is ridiculous. So I have said fuck it, no more Grind.<br/><br/>Now this sounds simple and it is if you understand the ramifications of what you are doing. Cutting out the Grind means cutting out the XP that players want and emptying rooms in your dungeon. <br/><br/>This being the case, after I work up a sketch of my series of encounters for my dungeon (dungeon is standing in for any series of linked encounters in this case), often building from some map I found somewhere, I look for the heart of the dungeon. What encounters are going to be fun, challenging, and worth going through? Which of these ten things bring something to the game, be it treasure, information, or satisfaction (as in we finally killed that fucker who had been after us since day 1)?<br/><br/>Typically, this brings me down by about half. That leaves some empty slots, which need to be filled with something. You have a couple of options. There are traps you could lay in, but those should be used sparingly cause who wants to spend the night solving some dumb ass puzzle or get fucked Tomb of Horrors style (man did those old adventures suck). <br/><br/>That leaves the roleplaying tool, skill challenges... Now skill challenges are tricky because they don't really flow organically with play all the time. I am trying a whole bunch of different approaches to get them to work better for us, but either way they work to cut down on the grind. Instead of fighting the wraith that is haunting the hallway, negotiate safe passage. Instead of fighting through that room, turn it into a rubble strewn obstacle course.<br/><br/>Skill challenges are ways to mix things up as well as add new quests. Maybe those negotiations with the wraith mean he demands they avenge his death... by killing a high up member of the church of Pellor? Maybe failing to get through the obstacle course successfully means that the rubble slides blocking that avenue of retreat? If you work in possibilities and conditionals, this approach will free you from the Grind and open up options rather than close doors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174082/#Comment_174082" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T08:42:14+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  8:42AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Keith,<br/>Battlemats and structured combat isn't an entirely new thing in gaming.

The entire combat system revolves around it. It is designed to work with it, rather than as an option (like in 3.x). I played the shit out of 3.x and not once did things flow as smoothly.

I already do it, and the idea came from a mod for WoW called BigWhigs. What it does is tell you a boss's special ability is firing in 10 seconds or what have you.

DnD is about smashing monsters, but if you look at a dungeon with 20 rooms with 20 encounters and if you are a busy adult playing once a week for 3 to 4 hours at a clip, it is going to take 10 weeks for one dungeon. That is far too long to hold interest. I play LOTRO once maybe twice a week for a few hours and it didn't take me ten weeks to get from 1 to 50 in levels. <br/><br/>Killing monsters is great, but when it takes that long it is not so great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174166/#Comment_174166" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T13:19:50+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  1:19PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, I have been constantly surprised by peoples tastes and interests when it comes to dnd.

(althought that group played twice a month for a little less than a year, that's about 20 sessions) and boy did they smash threw alot of rooms in that time. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes these are intelligent, skilled , adults, without a whole lot of spare time on their hands. <br/>\n<br/>\nYour preferences are just that your preferences, I don't mind to give grief here, but <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust saying, you can continue with your thread now<br/>\n<br/>\nLogos                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174309/#Comment_174309" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T10:05:50+00:00" title="October  9, 2008 10:05AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This didn't come out so well in as many photos as I'd like, but:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/richks/SJoHrlnZD6I/AAAAAAAAAk0/Qxz9H2K_UNI/s912/IMG_1114.JPG"/><br/>See that guy with the red base near the top right corner?  With the iron helmet?  That's a Kobold Dragonshield who's being flanked by the party's Dragonborn Paladin and Halfling Rogue.<br/><br/>The yellow thing stuck on his base is the Paladin's mark.  If you look really closely, you can see a blue one on the Dragonshield behind the Paladin.  That's where the Dwarf Fighter's marked that one.<br/><br/>(The colour of the base is used to keep track of which one's which for hit-point purposes.  I use a marker of that colour to write down the amount of damage that fig has taken on the battlemat near where they're stood.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174346/#Comment_174346" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T12:30:19+00:00" title="October  9, 2008 12:30PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2008 12:32PM by johnzo.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Senkowski</cite>he is the son of the Raven Queen</blockquote>\nDamn, she is a popular lady.  This is the third campaign I've heard of that is directly tied to her (well, counting my own.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rafial</cite>There may be other details to the technique, if so, hopefully Johnzo comes by and can detail it.</blockquote>\nWil has it covered, though my monster cards have the complete statblock on them, like the Game Mechanics' initiative cards that Logos mentioned upthread.  I screencap the stats from the source material, print them on 4"x6" cards, and laminate them so I can write on them with wet-erase markers -- hit point counts, initiative numbers, conditions, encounter power uses, etc.  Eventually I'll have cards for the whole Monster Manual.  It makes running combat so much faster when I have the complete monster in my mitt.<br/><br/>Kudos to Wizards for making their stuff available in electronic format -- game companies that don't do this don't get money from me anymore, ahem, Steve Jackson.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Senkowski</cite>I found that doesn't work, marking the cards (which is what I use for initiative order too) because the players can't see them. They aren't on the battle mat, and everything concerning the encounter should be plainly in front of anyone. The tactics involved are too important to have them forgotten cause they are on an index card.</blockquote>\nSo far I've been tracking all the conditions in the game on the cards, but for my own private use as the DM -- I figured I'd let players track conditions on the map in their own way, since there's such a huge incentive to do so.  I'd be open to having a unified on-the-table condition-tracking scheme, though.  Maybe I should buy some little rubber bands or girlie beads.<br/><br/>I do hold the monster cards like a poker hand so that the players can't see their stats and powers, which feels weird since I'm all about the no secrets mode of play.  Keith, do you keep monster stats secret or are the monsters open-book too?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174347/#Comment_174347" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T12:34:54+00:00" title="October  9, 2008 12:34PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is totally githyanki.  Andy's scripting cards are sweet.  I'm way inspired by them.<br/><br/>One of the next encounters in our Shadowfell game will be a big sprawling thing with a highly dynamic battlefield.  I'm thinking of making a big stack of wandering event cards for it.  Every time a player rolls between x and y on a d20, a card flips off the stack and the encounter transforms a little bit -- a key NPC appears, a minor XP-rewarding victory condition is revealed, the terrain changes, new monsters spawn, civilians take casualties, someone spots treasure...<br/><br/>Deciding how big a change to make with every card, and how frequently I want to flip them, is the big challenge.  The encounter does have a focal point to it, but I want the focus and the wandering events to provide the goodness in equal measure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
