Mouse Guard is pretty good at supporting a strict reading of the rules, where there are only one or two Tests plus maybe 1 drawn out Conflict during a single GM Turn, but also works okay if you are more fast-and-loose with this and have a more extended GM Turn with a bunch of different improvised tests based on what the players decide to do.  If this is your first time running it, I'd suggest sticking more on the conservative side, but don't be afraid to call for a Test or two if the players get creative or decide to approach things in ways you didn't anticipate.<br/><br/>Looser Mouse Guard starts feeling less like the comics, with their focused little nuggets of story, but is still great fun.  There is some risk of drifting it to be too loose, where it stops being Mouse Guard and becomes a related game which may not be as well supported (which kinda happened in my valkyries-on-hovercycles MG game).  But adding a couple of Tests here and there isn't a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279013/#Comment_279013" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-01T19:36:51+00:00" title="July  1, 2010  7:36PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say don't think in terms of tests, think in terms of "problems". The book uses the phrase obstacles, but that's a little confusing, since obstacle also is the amount of successes one needs on a roll.<br/><br/>So, once the mice have dealt with two "problems", whether a single problem could be a simple test or an extended series of tests, then move on to the Player's turn. You have to kind of go with your gut instinct. If something isn't striking you as particularly interesting, simply ask for one test and move on. If a moment feels important, you can zoom in and do a conflict, or zoom out and ask for a series of tests. Do what makes sense to the fiction, really. And don't worry about a too-short GM's turn, you can always do another set of turns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279015/#Comment_279015" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-01T20:16:51+00:00" title="July  1, 2010  8:16PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to think of it in terms of safety.

So I generally prepare 1 mission for every 2 hours of playtime.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 4 Hazard types in Mouse Guard (MG): Weather, Wilderness, Animals and Mice. For each type, the book lists example Obstacles to choose from. For a mission, pick 2 Obstacles from different Hazard types.<br/>\n<br/>\nObstacles can be:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Simple</b><br/>\n- 1 test<br/>\n- Examples: an overgrown path, a rushing river, bothersome bees, an angry merchant<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Complex</b><br/>\n- Multiple tests<br/>\n- I personally limit it to 2-3 tests, at most 1 per player (the book doesn't specify)<br/>\n- Examples: building something, rescuing someone or executing a complicated plan<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Conflicts</b><br/>\n- Multiple tests<br/>\n- Usually at least 3, often 6, rarely 9+<br/>\n- Examples: a fight, an argument, a chase<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, when a player fails a roll you can let them succeed at the cost of a Condition or fail by adding a Twist to the mission which replaces the failed Obstacle with a new Obstacle. When you use a Twist, more tests are required to complete the mission.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book says each Obstacle should be different. In addition to different Hazard types, the Obstacle should require players test different skills and abilities. It doesn't say that if the previous obstacle was Simple the next should be Complex or a Conflict but I find varying this up also helps with pacing but it is very situational.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM's Turn generally ends when the mission is finished or when the players reach safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes situations extend the mission for multiple sessions. For example, the mission deepens in some way or the players are far from safety. In these cases, the book recommends shorter turns. Switching back and forth between GM and Player's Turns as needed. Each day can be a new obstacle to overcome, each night a chance to rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, during the GM's turn, the pressure is on! There is no time to rest, no room to breathe. You can't recover Conditions unless you spend lots of Checks and you are usually far from safety.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've found the longer the GM's turn, the longer the Player's turn. Simply because the longer the GM's turn, the more chances the players have to earn Checks and the more Conditions they likely suffer which they will then need to recover from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279069/#Comment_279069" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-02T07:44:55+00:00" title="July  2, 2010  7:44AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice John. <br><br>When all else fails, I'll end the GM's turn when I'm out of steam.

My first few sessions of Mouse Guard I ran, I strictly modeled things after after sample adventures in the book (two-three preplanned obstacles, simple tests unless a twist happened), but as as time went on, I got looser and more organic.  I let situations arise, players respond to them, then broke down their responses into "okay, first you need to do X, and then Y" and typically presented them as complex obstacles.  I tended not to pull out conflict unless it was a really big deal. We had a bit of an issue with feeling like the conflict rules were a little disconnected from the fiction, so I favored Complex Obstacles when I could (this is the discussion Luke is referring to I think?)<br><br>Once I found my groove, I didn't worry specifically about "did we have enough tests?" when deciding to switch GM to Player's turn, it was more as John says a matter of safety.  During the GM turn is when the pressure is on, and you've got to go, go, go.  Once the pressure was off and the threat resolved for now, it was back to Player turn.  This didn't necessarily coincide with "in Town", sometimes it was "okay, you've escaped the town, ditched pursuit, now what? It's your turn..."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
