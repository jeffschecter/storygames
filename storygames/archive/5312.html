I have a couple dedicated projects right now, but most are going to take a long time to get to the state where I want them. Most aren't going to be finished and released as a final product in 2008.<br/><br/>So, Story Gamers: What projects are you actively working on that won't be released in 2008, and what development will they see through the next year?<br/><br/><br/>My answers:<br/><br/><br/><b>Perfect, The Original and Immaculate Revision</b>. Perfect v2 is going to undergo a lot of playtesting throughout the year. Specifically, I want to make sure that the rules for Contacts/Secret Societies work and fit the fiction, I want to make sure that the "crime cycle testing" process feels natural and unimposing, and I want to make sure that the game feels as streamlined, simple and still tactile as possible. I regret publishing Perfect v1 without enough playtesting to get it absolutely polished. It was good, it worked, but it had its clinks and clanks to it. I want to explore various production avenues beyond the one book method. What I currently envision for Perfect is a lidded box which contains the rulebook, setting ephemera and props (see Cold City's "Dossier"), character sheets, con-play handbooks ("Quick-start guide"), etc.<br/><br/><b>Argentine Wolf Boys</b>. Argentine Wolf Boys is a game I'm currently working on about orphan werewolves who work in the President of Argentina's private secret service. Pathos + Clandestine Action. I am currently starting playtesting for it. It won't be released in 2008 because: I want to make sure the tactical elements of the game are polished and un-clunky; I want to streamline the situation creation elements so that it works better on-the-fly; I want to write the text in a way that it can be played by total noobs. I also want to explore different physical packaging options, because Argentine Wolf Boys might come packaged with "pre-crafted missions" and NPC templates and mission templates and character sheets and a bunch of other play resources.<br/><br/><br/><b>Wash</b>. A game of apocalyptic community. Wash is set in the last (or maybe only) village that matters, and players take on the roles of the religious elite in this sacred community at the edge of oblivion and at the bend in the river. Wash hasn't seen a first draft yet, but lots of notes currently exist. I want to find some way of handling situation (not conflict, and not scene) before that first draft gets written. Wash is a mixture of ass-kicking in an apocalyptic epic, dangerous negotiations with dangerous allies, and a game about community resource management. It's going to take a lot to get that fairly far-sweeping scope to function as a cohesive, coherent game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119544/#Comment_119544" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T19:56:53+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  7:56PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Good question, Joe!</p>\n<p>For me, there are two (instead of your <em>in-fucking-sane</em> three)</p>\n<p><strong>The Gathering Storm</strong>.  My 2-player "all in a tuckbox" card-driven rpg.  It's set in London during the Blitz, and it's all about short, brutal and (hopefully) uplifting slice-of-life stories.  Outside of the purely SIS-based roleplaying stuff, there's a gently competitive game going on between the two players -- you're trying to destroy London <em>just so</em>.  The bulk of the work is research -- I've got to scrounge up tons of imagery for the cards.</p>\n<p><strong>Imperator</strong>.  This one barely makes the list, but it's there.  This one's a weird cousin of <em>Storm</em>.  It's a multi-player abstract wargame on one level (played on a chess-board).  The wargame drives the SIS for a RPG about why it sucks to be caught in the middle of intergalactic war.  The RPG in turn drives the wargame via altering the tactical situation (coups, uprisings, etc.)  This one just needs to be worked on.</p>\n<p>Of course, both are backburnered when compared to <em>Black Cadillacs</em>.  However, I've found that poking at each of them is a good way to take that every-so-often necessary break from the main project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119550/#Comment_119550" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T20:31:20+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  8:31PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Van Dread.</b> Might see the light of day this year, but probably won't.

Now, the major license is, not surprisingly, a big deal.

Making a roleplaying system specifically to game The Fountain, Vanilla Sky, and Koyaanaquatsi is a helluva lot of fun, and the mechanics are coming together nicely... except for this strange brick wall I've hit surrounding ego death. Considering all the other stresses racing through my brain (recently breaking off an engagement, beginning a long-awaited career as a touring musician, sinking waist deep into rosicrucian study time) I doubt I'll have the cerebral fortitude to examine fictitious headspace in the manner necessary to draw the project to a point where it's ready for outside playtesting, short of possibly harassing Matt and the Nords to tell me what they think, since it's clearly in the Norwegian Style of play. *shrug* We'll see!<br/><br/>I also have plenty of hopeless heartbreakers I've tooled into a finished condition as a learning experience and mental exercise. One has even been playtested copiously, but I still doubt I'll publish it, because, really, why bother? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120566/#Comment_120566" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-19T05:28:05+00:00" title="January 19, 2008  5:28AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Wrath: The Third Book of Pandemonium</b> probably won't make it this year.
