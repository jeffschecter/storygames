But think of this from my perspective, I need to solve this problem and I need advice!)</small></p><p>OK so my once so numerous group has dwindled. Five people have moved cities, one had already played ToA with another group (in hindsight, I should\u2019ve not ran it then. That player was awesome. But he was talking about quitting anyway\u2026?), a few I kinda had a hard time getting along with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23emo2097&amp;Mode=like">#emo2097</a></p><p>But I found one new player. So we now have four players and this campaign started with them.</p><p>Unfortutanely, while two of the old players are solid rocks, the new player and one of the other players are flakes. They vote for days in the scheduler and then change their minds after we have selected days based on those votes, or they show up but then are like \u201cI don\u2019t want to play D&amp;D since [X] isn\u2019t here, let\u2019s play board games\u201d. The two rocks, if they two show up, then there is game. Sometimes they die because they are only two.</p><p>And by rocks here, I mean scheduling-wise. All four of the players are great players <em>when we <strong>do</strong> play</em>. The problem isn\u2019t playing with them, it\u2019s the <em>not</em> playing.</p><p>Like, yesterday, there was no day in the schedule-voting app that had all four. I chose the day with three votes (plus myself, makes four). Which was a mistake because two of those three votes were the flakes! One changed their mind and the other did show up but when he saw that it was only him and one more player (one of the rocks), he didn\u2019t want to play.</p><p>And they were like \u201ccan you scale the adventure\u201d and I was (with Scarlet Heroes in mind) like \u201cYes! How about, the two of you get twice the amount of actions each round, and you get two pools of HP each\u201d and they were like \u201cno, but, can you change the encounters\u201d. <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/> FML</p><p>So you want to go into a jungle where the goblin tribes are decimated, the t-rexes never show up, the giants are missing half their friends etc etc\u2026 Also, all such changes would introduce more subjectivity than I can. I have explicitly taken <em>away</em> my mandate to change around things like that. Like, as soon as I think \u201cwow, I\u2019m so lucky to have a group that <em>gets</em> it\u201d, they blurt out something like this. That guy had been talking about OSR stuff and I had been like \u201cwow, yeah, he\u2019s one of the best players of all time, he understands how the game is set up\u201d etc etc. But no.</p><p>I can\u2019t give D&amp;D advice since my game doesn\u2019t work anymore. I think the game is <em>great</em> whenever we\u2019re actually playing, but the \u201coh, the game is so addictive, they come back week after week\u201d factor isn\u2019t there. Since they flake out.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474767/#Comment_474767" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-15T08:33:16+00:00" title="June 15, 2018  8:33AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds exactly like my local situation here. We simply stopped the campaign last year because it was too much of a pain to deal with the flakes - better to play some short-form story games and such instead, where you don't need to maintain an on-going momentum of action from week to week. Come back to regular campaign play when the player base improves again.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D campaign doesn't mind flakes participating, but they should not have a vote on anything, really; they're just passengers. The real social and creative choices are made by the hard core of the group. There doesn't need to be more than two of these regulars, but you do need more flakes to off-set their irregularity if you only have the minimum of regular players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474769/#Comment_474769" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-15T09:12:34+00:00" title="June 15, 2018  9:12AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Eero.<br/><br/>The prob is that once we <i>are</i> playing, the flakes do well at contributing socially, with high energy, and with great creative choices and gameplay. (So do the rocks.)<br/><br/>But two regular + two flakes is around one regular or two flakes short of a great campaign. So the solution is to soldier on until we can find more. But it's been a rough campaign so far, one of the worst ones ever in terms of actually getting people to the table. Even though the sessions are good once we <i>do</i> play.<br/><br/>Also upon sleeping upon it one of the rocks suggested hiring NPC henches to solve the scaling issue.

In the context of psychology it's the traditional behavior of pleasantries and coffee. Postmodernism is a reaction to that idea of one true solution, and to instead hold multiple conflicting perspectives or viewpoints.<br/><br/>So when it comes to RPGs, I <i>am</i> very impressed by the two main strictly modernist/revisionist schools of thought (collab storygaming &amp; referee OSR), that modernist tendency does not extend to psychology or \u201dsanity\u201c since the maelstrom of everyday existence is a grinding pain to me. Somatically. And talking to real people instead of their player characters is frustrating and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Guh, why do I always reveal too much on S-G. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474800/#Comment_474800" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-16T07:32:26+00:00" title="June 16, 2018  7:32AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you'd be surprised about how common these sorts of feelings are for serious roleplayers, Sandra.

Even if I might like it if someone did that, intellectually I know that's absurd. But I do expect you not to drop it like it's hot.

This seems to be global, I hear everybody encountering the same types of attitude.<br/><br/>Maybe it's something in the laid-back and introverted social culture. Like, people participate in game sessions and meet these intensely focused practitioners, and the table culture is very restrained and, well, quiet. There's no long-term arc of practice like there would be in a theater group or a sports club - you're not doing the game towards anything. So ultimately there's no reason to rank the game over watching TV if you feel like it tonight: the grey semi-persons in the group don't matter, there's no over-arching project relying on my participating today, and so on.<br/><br/>What roleplaying clearly needs is a certain minimum quotient of irate grandmothers who care about it like it was the bingo night. You could send one of those to haunt the flakes every time they decide to skip on a session for no good reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474803/#Comment_474803" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-16T07:58:22+00:00" title="June 16, 2018  7:58AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unfairly enough, Eero, I accused one of the flakes for seeing us as his personal video game that he expected to be On whenever he wanted to play and Off when he didn't. But... in this thread I guess I've inadvertently revealed sentiments of my own that can be read similarly. Since I'm more interested in talking to his chosen persona than his mundane self. And found myself guiltily nodding along AF to your description of not "being at beck and call" \u2014 like how frustrated I get when he ditches D&amp;D to "go to a party" etc. Ofc, in order to find some more players perhaps I have to go to some parties. Put on a D&amp;D t-shirt and strike up some convos.<br/><br/>I've been talking to the rocks about maybe setting up a house where we can live and then everyday after work play D&amp;D. Inspired by <a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">@EmmatheExcrucian</a> and her tales of their group that all lives together.<br/><br/>Deliverator, I guess we feel the same, yeah. And, like... I feel guilty about it because it <i>is</i> a voluntary activity, right? It's similar to playing music. Some people sometimes feel like jamming, but never signed up for it to be like the army or full time work or an everyweek activity. And... I also feel guilty because when I recruit people for the game, I never push the "it's a heavy commitment you need to show up every time" angle, I'm like "ooooh nooo don't worry, you can miss sessions lalala" etc. This is why I'm more frustrated with one flake than the other, because he has played with us longer and he has had more chances to reveal just how lowly he prioritizes D&amp;D. The other flake is new and I see it as she's only getting her feet wet and that feels legit to me. However, scheduling sessions around them is a losing gambit.<br/><br/>My thinking yesterday was this: rocks get a full vote on what day it is and flakes can only tiebreak. Attending three sessions in a row without missing a single one gives you rock status. Missing <i>two</i> sessions since you last gained rock status gives you flake status. That way, flakes can become rocks. And rocks can miss every fourth session without becoming flakes. And if they become flakes they can become rocks again.<br/><small>(This is modernism btw. Evidence of the over-systematizing, over-gamifying brain. Which... makes me a good fit for the DM's chair because I come up with mechanics for unexpected situations. But it makes me a bad fit to do the scheduling/social work of the DM because I get frustrated by people prioritizing other hobbies.)</small> But I also fear that openly categorizing people as "flakes" makes them even more likely to (paradoxically both simultaneously) behave flakily and be upset at being seen as flakes. Perhaps I can rephrase/vagueify this algorithm to make it palatable for flaky ears.<br/><br/>Wait... palatable... ears... you don't eat with your ears T_T                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474804/#Comment_474804" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-16T08:11:08+00:00" title="June 16, 2018  8:11AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another reason I should feel guilty because I've sometimes shut the campaign down for months at a time.

(I'm talking about the rocks, mainly, not the flakes...) And yes, if you want more and more reliable players, you are going to have to do some extrovert stuff like go to parties and try to recruit people for one-shots, then see if they're interested in more. It can be exhausting and frustrating, but it's worth it when it works out.<br/><br/>And only somewhat related: I definitely think you are reaping what you've sown when it comes to telling people it's okay to miss sessions. While you may not want to reveal your entire heart during Session Zero, it's pretty legit to talk about how the game should be like any other social commitment, and that you do put a fair amount of work in as a GM, and that *you* always keep your calendar clear for game night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474815/#Comment_474815" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-16T20:36:22+00:00" title="June 16, 2018  8:36PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2018 8:37PM by 2097.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're right \xd7 2<br/><br/>I have like this idea that non-myself people don't REALLY like RPGs.

It's not uncommon for me to have some overlapping fields of interest outside of gaming with people I've come to know through the game. For example, I mostly end up playing frisbee golf (a casual outdoors sport) with gaming associates, it seems.<br/><br/>Just today we took a little field trip with a friend to the regional hospital (a 100 km drive) to check on a gaming associate who's there for a short stay. We did some preliminary planning/study for our upcoming 4th edition <i>Chronicles of Prydain</i> thing, and I left him the rulebooks so he can while away the hours with some character design and rules study. It's never been spoken about, but I suppose the general gist of our relationship is that having gamed together for two years has allowed us to know get to know each other, and having been found mutually acceptable, we've graduated from acquaintances to friends.<br/><br/>I suspect that this more common socially in gaming than maintaining professional distance indefinitely. It's an ambitious creative hobby after all, so we tend to flourish it over time with all sorts of social capital exercises. The friendship feat, having little in the way of requirements aside from getting to know each other, is sort of a no-brainer investment in that kind of context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474817/#Comment_474817" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-16T21:20:37+00:00" title="June 16, 2018  9:20PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "cancel game night" is the outrageous part.

If 2 or more people cancel, then we will cancel for the week."<br/><br/>*This is getting less common, but in the US, because of TTRPG's bad rep here for a long time, there really are people who are reasonably normal and reliable in general, but will ditch RPGing specifically at the drop of a hat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474821/#Comment_474821" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T06:22:18+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  6:22AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The 'in addition to'...
