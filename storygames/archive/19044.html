I personally like to describe it as "Shaft and the Dukes of Hazzard team up to fight the Baseball Furies." We're looking to get additional feedback and play-testing, and would appreciate anyone taking the time to check out our work.<br/><br/><b>Role, Story, Buzz</b><br/>Characters in So77 are made of three primary components; role - what they do, story - how they do it, and buzz - why they do it. <br/><br/>John Shaft is a Tough Guy who\u2019s One Bad Mother and out for Payback.<br/>Barbarella is a Honeypot who\u2019s got X-Tech and is looking for Love.<br/>Jim Rockford is a Sleuth who\u2019s an Ex-Con and looking for Cold Hard Cash.<br/>Dirty Harry is a Vigilante Former Badge who\u2019s out for Justice.<br/><br/>By mixing and matching Roles, Stories and Buzz you can make a huge variety of unique characters. To facilitate this, character "Rap Sheets" are made of two pages, one for your Story and one for your Role - the two pages combined make your full character.<br/><br/><b>What\u2019s your Thang?</b><br/>A faithful butler, a bitchin \u201871 Hemi \u2018Cuda , or a gold plated .44 magnum revolver, every character has a Thang, something interesting that\u2019s part of their character.<br/><br/><b>Turn up the Heat and Get your Groove on</b><br/>Heat and Groove are mechanics specific to So77. Heat is used to represent the interest of The Man, the more trouble you cause the more Heat you get, which can then be used against you. Groove is used to power rocker abilities, it\u2019s gained by performing and spent to power moves and empower your friends.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.monkeyfunstudios.org/SO77/Spirit_of_77_Book_1_Rough_Draft_Nov2013_v3.pdf" rel="nofollow">Our most recent draft can be found here.</a><br/><a href="http://www.monkeyfunstudios.org/SO77/SO77_Rap_Sheet_V3_Large.pdf" rel="nofollow">Rap Sheets can be found here.</a><br/><br/>...and yes, you can have a monkey. <br/><br/>If there's enough interest, I'll be happy to run a playtest session based on feedback. <br/><br/>Thanks, and keep on....   truckin'.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425132/#Comment_425132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T12:58:24+00:00" title="December  3, 2013 12:58PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the look of the character sheets.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434894/#Comment_434894" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-05T22:38:42+00:00" title="July  5, 2014 10:38PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played this today and it was pretty damn awesome.<br/><br/>Or uh "groovy" or whatever we used to say back in the 70s.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
