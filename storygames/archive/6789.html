You can read the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6539" rel="nofollow">discussion about the previous session</a> before getting into this one, but it's not totally necessary. As a quick note ahead, I'm probably going to misspell most of the character names because I never really saw them in writing. Incidentally, and embarrassingly, I misremembered my own character's name last time... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>At the top of the We Owe list was Shakham, my priest of the Old Gods. He's a tall, dark fellow with a shaved head and pierced rings going along the outside of his arms, which he decorates with bells and jewelry to announce his coming wherever he goes. His power is Morbid Curses, and it was only after I'd already broadened it that we discovered that you can't recharge and shuffle your dice if you do that (you only get to pick one change). So I chose to "heal" him instead. This is important, as it's all the more reason not to get injured or exhausted from conflicts if you plan for your character to return.<br/><br/>From the oracle, I'd picked the high, many-towered wall at the fierce border with the few soldiers left to hold it. We decided that this was a border of the Thelan empire, the same people who were meddling with Shakham's home country of Goloqat in our first session. Shakham came to the wall ostensibly to support his new allies against the Eyrie Lords, bird-god-worshipping mountain people, some of which ride giant eagles. Their army was amassing close to the wall, and they were sending one of the Lords to parlay.<br/><br/>Matt played Salome, the golden-haired war sorceress who led an elite unit of war witches against the Eyrie Lords. She owns the Commanding Spear, a relic of hope that allows her to inspire her followers. Her best interests were to marry Belaron, the current ruler of Goloqat, and to bring about peace with the Eyrie Lords.<br/><br/>David played Tor Mok, the Thelan champion who wields the Weeping Blade, an axe that constantly drips with the Blood of the Innocent (as David pointed out, the guy is a hoot and a holler at weddings and other joyful gatherings). Tor Mok's best interests were to die gloriously in battle and to see Salome destroyed in the eyes of the Thelan Emperor.<br/><br/>Due to the oracle, we also had a tyrant with a demon of rage and avarice. We decided that Adat, the Thelan Emperor, was the tyrant. His demon was Molok, a demon imp in the guise of a man, and Colin wisely decided that Molok was an escaped prisoner from the hells of the Old Gods, thereby connecting him to Shakham. Both Adat and Molok were NPCs. Adat wanted to marry Salome and to get tribute from the Eyrie Lords. Molok wanted all-out war. We also had the commanding officer who was jealous of Tor Mok and wanted him to die shamefully.<br/><br/>At this point, it was obvious what Shakham's best interests and real reasons for the trip to the border were: to capture Molok and collect the Commanding Spear and the Weeping Blade to use for the glory of the Old Gods.<br/><br/>We had a couple of scenes without conflict that established the situation: Shakham talked to the Emperor and expressed support, but also recognized Molok. The Emperor held war council with Tor Mok and Salome and decided to try a peaceful resolution (mainly because he's got the hots for Salome). Then there was a confrontation between Molok and Shakham, during which Shakham threatened the demon and tore off a part of his shirt (needed for the Morbid Curses ritual). And finally, Tor Mok (with secret support from his CO) decided to venture out and ambush the Eyrie Lord on his own accord.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151156/#Comment_151156" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T06:23:52+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  6:23AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Molok fired up the Emperor for war after the council session, so Salome took 10 of her war witches and went to confront him on the top of the wall, in the middle of an unnatural blizzard. Molok used his powers to enrage nearby soldiers and they fought it out. This is where our understanding of the distribution of authority in IaWA really became important.<br/><br/>My basic understanding is this: similarly to my experience with forum games (chat-based, "freeform" play), everyone has total authority over their character starting at their skin. I can say that I attack your PC, but I never get to say what the effect is; that's always within your authority. Even during conflicts, the Answerer narrates and thereby determines the effect (taking the dice outcome into consideration). The only exception to this is exhausting or injuring someone, which is a mechanical but not narrative intrusion.<br/><br/>So far, so good. But what about minor diceless NPCs? In forum games, whoever introduces those kinds of side characters owns them as though they were part of her character, just like any other detail (like someone's sword). That's how we played here mostly as well: Colin described that the soldiers attacked the war witches and won the Challenge, but it was up to Matt to narrate how much the war witches were hurt, whether any of them died, and so on. That worked well, and our conflicts this time around went much more smoothly than in our first session.<br/><br/>Salome got captured and thrown into the dungeon. Thereafter, Molok burst into Shakham's tent with Shakham's wife, Gwindel, held at knifepoint by one of his soldiers. I (the player) had insisted on bringing Gwindel along because of two reasons: 1) I knew she'd make for a good way to gain leverage over the otherwise hard-to-impress Shakham; and 2) she's the one thing that makes him somewhat likeable (he really does love her and would sacrifice anything for her). So that conflict ends with Gwindel in the dungeon, chained up next to Salome, and Shakham fuming in defeat.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Tor Mok devises a plan to get to the Eyrie Lord. After a successful distraction, he busts into the tent and manages to capture the Lord as well as his Lieutenant. He takes them back to a different dungeon, where he persuades the Lord to send the Lieutenant to kill the Emperor, so that Tor Mok can take over the throne.<br/><br/>Shakham prays to the Old Gods to show him the way to Gwindel and makes it to her cell, where she already had told Salome that he'd come (Colin: "Don't worry, my husband is the avatar of the Unspeakable Gods. He will rescue us and destroy our enemies!"). He frees Salome under the condition that she gives him the spear if they work together to kill Molok. At this point, Molok has the spear.<br/><br/>Tor Mok leads the Lieutenant to the Emperor via secret passageways. The Lieutenant attacks--he's an avian-themed assassin, with a feathered cloak and little spikes he throws at his enemies. The Lieutenant puts out one of the Emperor's eyes, exhausting him (to D4/0), but the Emperor chokes him to death. So Tor Mok has to finish his own dirty work; he steps in with a follow-up conflict and stabs the incredulous Emperor with the Lieutenant's spike, right in the heart (exhausted to 0/0 means death for the Emperor). Then he sneaks away so that the Eyrie Lords will be blamed for the assassination. It turns out that the Lieutenant was the Eyrie Lord's son, which complicates matters. (Colin: "What happened to my son?" David: "Don't worry, you'll be with him soon.") Tor Mok sets the Lord free. <br/><br/>Shakham returns to his tent and set out to bestow Molok with a Morbid Curse (which is far-reaching). At the same time, Salome storms into Molok's chamber to kill him the manual way. At this point we actually manage to run conflicts with multiple participants pretty smoothly. Molok defeats Shakham in the first round; we negotiate that I promise to leave him in peace if he promises to give me Salome's spear. Then Molok defeats Salome and drags her away to toss before the Emperor as a traitor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151157/#Comment_151157" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T06:24:07+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  6:24AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We end up with a final gathering of all of the important characters in the throne room: Molok brings Salome, Shakham comes to collect the spear, and Tor Mok arrives just in time when the news of the Emperor's death hits to claim the throne. Shakham receives the spear, but in a moment of utter hatred against Molok (who tears off his human flesh husk and taunts him) he wants to toss it into one of the guards holding Salome so that she can fight the demon. But Tor Mok doesn't want that to happen and grabs Shakham's wrist in mid-throw. They are locked in lethal stares, but Shakham realizes that the Weeping Blade could take his head right off, and who'd take care of Gwindel then? So he concedes and retreats (with Gwindel and the spear).<br/><br/>Salome, however, uses her magic to whip up the blizzard and shoot spikes of ice into Molok's heart. Because we're just about at the end of our play time and this seems like a good conclusion, Colin declares the demon dead (turned to ice) as Salome wins the conflict. Now the Thelan Empire has a new Emperor who lusts for blood, with Salome's future depending on whether she can convince him to keep the peace--all while the Eyrie Lord who doesn't yet know that his son is dead is approaching the wall with his army. And Shakham marches away through the snow, Gwindel by his side and the Commanding Spear on his back.<br/><br/>And who's on top of the We Owe list?

I wrote a huge post and Story Games ate it <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>  Here's the condensed version anyway.<br/><br/>Colin here, I DMd the game and had great fun. The players were active and supportive as usual, and I think we all had a much better handle on the rules thanks to our previous thread on Story Games and some pre-game discussion over dinner.<br/><br/>I had set some personal goals for myself this time, and I think I hit most of them to one degree or another:\n<ul>\n<li>Make the NPCs more proactive. Last time the NPCs kind've faded into the background and it turned into a PvP-fest. This time the NPCs were "out there" a bit more, acting as foils for the players, pinging their Best Interests, and not just laying down when confronted.</li>\n<li>More details. I tried to narrate in more detail, although I probably could have done a bit more. The birdman assassin Arthos was great fun. He started as a nameless lieutenant of Darthnonis, turned out to be an assassin, and we finally find out that he's Darthonis' son. It's a pity he died, I would have liked to see him in a later Chapter. As it is, I think I'll play him in some other game ^_^</li>\n<li>I tried to keep an eye on the Best Interests sheet at the outset of every scene and let it guide me when running the NPCs. I think it worked out pretty well.</li>\n<li>"Circling the Conflict" - We had a lot more "talky" scenes, with a more comfortable level of face-stabbing, which I was pretty happy about. Shakham was great for this, because he wasn't invested directly in the conflicts revolving around the Emperor, so he could change sides more freely.</li>\n<li>A purely technical detail, but I'm trying to stand up more when I DM. I play more than I DM, and there's a tendency to fade into the background or review the papers in front of me when I'm not "on". I find standing up really helps break me out of that.</li>\n</ul>\nPlaying Molok was fun - like Grima Wormtongue from LotR mixed with Uncle Frank from Hellraiser. Actually, all the NPCs were great fun to play this time.  I find that 3 is about the limit of my focus, though.  Other named NPCs tend to fade into the background as the big movers and shakers move forward.<br/><br/>I'm trying really hard not to play favorites, but I'll be really curious to see if Shakham (SHAKHAAAAAM!) makes it through all the chapters of our story. This time was really interesting because he was very much a Conan or Yojimbo figure, getting caught up in some crazy bloodbath and getting out of it in the end with a little reward of his own.<br/><br/>All in all, great fun. Looking forward to next time!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151191/#Comment_151191" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T10:44:01+00:00" title="June 17, 2008 10:44AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is it about IAWA that makes me hatch fiendish plots?

Some have said that PTA, for example,  exercises their scene-framing muscles, or that the mechanic of Fan Mail helped their group play together better even outside the context of PTA by encouraging engagement and attention to scenes their character is not present in, or giving the sense that they're perfoming for an "audience" besides just the GM, and therefore bringing extra energy to how they narrate their character's actions, for example.  I feel like I got those kind of benefits from our PTA game.<br/><br/>Guided by the text, we've twice created character interests and motivations that are *really* diametrically opposed to one another, as much to each other as to the GM's NPCs.  A couple of examples:<br/><br/>a) Tor-Mak, champion of the Thelan Empire, wants to see the war sorceress Salome utterly destroyed in the eyes of Emperor Adad.  He also wanted war with the border-nation of the Eyrie Lords.<br/>b) Salome, commanding war sorceress, desires that the Thelan Empire not come to war with the Aerie Lords.<br/><br/>a) Shakham, priest of the Old Gods, wants to capture the demon Moloch, disguised advisor to Emperor Adad.  He also wants the Spear of Mithras artifact which Salome wields.<br/>b) Salome wants to kill Moloch to release his hold on the Emperor.  The Spear of Mithras is her particular Strength!<br/><br/>In addition to looking out for what will make an entertaining story, you really get a lot of practice at negotiation and compromise while playing this game, and in doing so, it feels like you are learning to look out for your fellow players.  It seems pretty difficult for characters to achieve both of their interests, and if they *did* it would often be partially at the "expense" of another PC's interests.  So, unless you're willing to be a complete ass and stomp on others' fun, you must "give" on some things.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of my improv training and how scenes go nowhere and are dull if/when both actors refuse to yield; good improvisers are almost in a race to give first so the scene can move forward.<br/><br/>My character, Salome, got beaten down a couple times narratively through most of the session.  In the final scenes, Christian risked (narratively) his own characters' best interest (the Spear of Mithras), to help Salome out.<br/><br/>At the end, David's Tor-Mak, as the new Emperor could have insisted on immediate conflict with the Eyrie Lords and the death/banishment/humiliation of Salome.  But he heeded her (my) council to reserve the Empire's strength to first attack the enemies of Goloqat and shore up that alliance.  It felt like he was looking out for me as a player to see that Salome got to achieve one of her interests.  Tor-Mok did not achieve either of his best interests, but he did get to usurp the throne of the Empire, so that's something\u2026<br/><br/>I try to learn things whenever I roleplay, but IAWA seems like a methodical teacher in addition to being fun.<br/><br/>Paul: Seems like it's a mix of mechanics and looking out for each other that plays into negotiation.<br/><br/>Colin: I have a whiteboard for Best Interests.  I'd possibly like to see the dice of the NPCs as well so we know how go after them if we're trying to get on the Owe list.

I have no problem posting it all up on the whiteboard provided the other players don't mind. Or we can simply show our sheets to anyone who asks if we feel posting all the dice would crowd things.  Either way works for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151209/#Comment_151209" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T13:03:34+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  1:03PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a large (4' x 4') green cork-board that could be used in lieu of a white board if necessary.<br/><br/>I snagged it from the U of O when the Geology Building was renovated, along with a 5'x5' photo of the Moon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
