We ran a triple blind star trek, double-blind gettsburg, double-blind fantasy, double-blind cyberpunk, the list goes on.

Games were run at the same time but in adjacent rooms.  The world we played in did not rotate and so half of the planet was always light while the other was always dark.  Recently, a mysterious wall of fog encircled the border and the peoples of the light and the peoples of the dark each suspected or blamed the other of causing it (in preparation for attack!).  Each GM ran a game based on the factions of one side of the world.  When you died, you handed in your character sheet and switched to the other game.  The two GMs then got together and discussed world level events and AP between sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336257/#Comment_336257" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T10:50:15+00:00" title="July 28, 2011 10:50AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.... shared relationship map, eh?<br/><br/>What if there was a relationship map that was shared via technology that contained notes on NPC's.

They could be affected by the bribes you place and have to clean up the crime scenes you create. Once they get close enough the police could call a dual session \u201ccrackdown\u201d. Suddenly the jailed group gets more players.<br/><br/>You could start with separate relationship maps, but then they start to get more and more connections as the police get informants and such.<br/><br/>So...<i>Gangbusters! </i>then?<br/><br/>(I love that game. Definitely an overlooked Old Skool Era gem)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336437/#Comment_336437" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-29T23:16:30+00:00" title="July 29, 2011 11:16PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once participated in a duel campaign. There were two groups meeting on different night so the week. Each group had a seperate GM that also played in the other campaign. It was really awesome. One group started off as gladiators enslaved by an expansionist kingdom, the second played heroes in a city soon to be occupied by said kingdom, the groups eventualy met up and had some interesting cross overs. The two GMs passed setting material back and forth. Lots of cool stuff going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336474/#Comment_336474" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-30T18:32:37+00:00" title="July 30, 2011  6:32PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, pretty much any game with a GM can do this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
