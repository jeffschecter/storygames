Dungeon Girls is for my older 7th grade daughter, her best friend, and three good friends from her old school (she started another middle school this fall).  I'm running this group every other week, alternating with Dungeon Kids, which is for Junior Moppet and a couple of her fellow third-graders.  Today we had the second Dungeon Girls game.  I'm happy to report it's going swimmingly.  Two girls have zero experience with gaming before this, one had some D&amp;D experience, and the bestie has had a smattering of experience, some of it with me and the moppets.  They're all super enthused, bring a lot of energy to the table, and are all busily drawing their characters, pets, gear, you name it.  They all want pets, actually, but since only the Ranger and the Druid have the Pet Special Ability, they're hitting the markets with their loot hoping to buy exotic animals they can train.<br/><br/>The Dungeon Girls are fielding a Druid (ranger-wizard mix), a "Guild Assassin" (ranger-thief mix), a Ranger (with a motherfuckin' LION for a pet), a Wizard, and a Paladin (fighter-cleric mix).  So far they've been hacking their way through cultists and lesser demons, and they've spent quite a bit of time shopping.  They've been great about deliberating and negotiating.  Today as their fifth arrived to generate her character, they decided on their own that they wanted to adopt the Dungeon World notion of only one of any class being played, so as to protect the uniqueness of each character. I hadn't told them about that or suggested it; the idea was completely organic.<br/><br/>The Dungeon Kids only have the two players so far, since their third hasn't made it to a session yet, but they're each running two characters.  Junior Moppet has her Thief, who just hit third level today, and a Wizard.  Her bestie has a Ranger and a straight up Assassin (thief-fighter mix).  Last weekend they played for five hours straight, and truth be told, they're incredibly good at embracing and suggesting adverse outcomes.<br/><br/>Anyway, I just wanted to share.  More kudos to John Harper.  World of Dungeons is pitch-perfect for this set--I've played with adults too, and it's golden, but the kids, damn...they're eating this up.  The parents are excited too.  It's really, really fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392675/#Comment_392675" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T01:14:27+00:00" title="October  8, 2012  1:14AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, this is great!

What's really caught me off-guard is the sheer enthusiasm.  The girls at my daughter's old school are asking my wife (a teacher there) about the next game practically every day.  My girls like WoD better than Faery's Tale, in part because the high fantasy setting apparently feels more accessible, but I think the rules offer more transparent structure.  Anyway, yeah, enthusiasm... The Dungeon Girl Ranger player came with her character and lion drawn, colored, and cut out and pasted on brown construction paper.  Everyone's drawing the content of their backpacks.<br/><br/>For the Dungeon Kids, I had a great moment where they came across a room with a fountain in it, and I described a weathered statue of an ancient goddess who turned out to be the Goddess of the Moon, Hope, and Travel.  The well had gold coins the characters could take, but a Lore roll determined that the Goddess demanded something back to help give future travellers hope.  The crafty Ranger traded essentially useful but common things.  But then Junior Moppet's Wizard declared,<i> "I give her my life,"</i> and rolled a success (WIS) to be marked by the Goddess as a future priestess (can multiclass as Cleric next level).  There's tremendous freedom in the way the mechanic drives at creative outcome choices but still accommodates the spontaneous appearance of awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392804/#Comment_392804" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-08T23:46:08+00:00" title="October  8, 2012 11:46PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And yeah, I'm kinda gushing.

The older girls are all seventh-grade, all from the same social circle last year, so they bring a lot of girlfriend energy.  Number Five, the Paladin, chose to play a boy character, for which she received a few raised eyebrows that gave way to responses of "Cool!  A boy in the group!"  The Wizard, whose player is really quiet, brought her own polyhedrals this time.  The Assassin is already a die-hard gamer who apparently hangs out in MUDs; she declared she loves dungeoning and would play every day if she could.<br/><br/>The younger set hasn't fully mobilized yet, as the (actual) boy player couldn't make it to the sessions we've had thus far.  On the other hand, the two girls (both third-graders) play together really well, so Junior Moppet's tendency toward elaborate dramatic description isn't getting under Elder Moppet's skin.  It'll be interesting to see what energy the boy brings.<br/><br/><i>Some cool moments from the Dungeon Girls game:</i><br/><br/>- The Wizard taking an excess-of-level dose of quicksilver to summon her ice fox spirit and (failing CON roll) being sheathed in ice and frost as the careless spirit froze one of the demons fighting the party.<br/><br/>- The Paladin shield-rushing the frozen demon and (critical success) exploding through it in a scatter of frozen demon chunks.<br/><br/>- The Ranger throwing a dagger at an onrushing demon and (critical success) pegging it right in the third eye to kill it instantly.<br/><br/>- The Druid attempting a sword strike against the possessed priest threatening the Guild Assassin and (failure) hitting her friend instead as the priest swung the Guild Assassin around as a shield.<br/><br/>- The shivering Wizard trying to use her Candle cantrip to burn the demon's hand so it'd let go of the Guild Assassin and (failure) lighting the Assassin's sleeve on fire instead (for an HP of damage).<br/><br/><i>Another cool moment from the Dungeon Kids game:</i><br/><br/>- The two girls going into another room to plot their attack on the cave with the giant spiders "so I wouldn't know what they were going to do and it'd be a surprise."  The plan turned out to be to loan the Wizard the Resist Poison ring, have her take a torch out into the middle of the room and taunt the spiders.  When they attacked, the Ranger would pick them off using her bow.  If any spiders got a bite in, the ring would neutralize their poison.  Meanwhile, the Thief stealthed in to liberate the captive gnome hanging in the spiders' web.  The strategy actually worked pretty well.  I'm impressed.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393098/#Comment_393098" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T05:08:32+00:00" title="October 11, 2012  5:08AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Blake, what kind of prep are you / the Dungeon Girls DM doing prior to play?

I've hardly done any prep, in part because almost all of these players are too new to know what their flags are, though I can make some guesses based on character picks and some of the behavior I've seen in play.  For monsters, I'm going with very rough, low HP opposition.  There's a lot of flavor description and then I cue off the die roll for fictional results.  I had a big bad in the possessed priest corpse last Dungeon Girls session that was basically immune to being killed, but not to being hacked apart, burned up, etc.  In that case, I didn't even bother tracking HP.  Positioning details and the associated tactical maps haven't seemed necessary yet, but I'll probably try them at some point, if only for flavor.  Then I just award everyone XP.<br/><br/>For the Dungeon Kids, I riffed a few things in response to their choices.  When they investigated the cult that sent assassins to kill their characters, they ended up at a dockside warehouse and encountered a saw golem.  I gave that monster and its mechanical claw- and saw-tipped arms HP and an armor rating, then gave the warehouse a certain number of HP to reflect the saw golem sawing up the wood and converting it to lethal wooden shrapnel it blasted at the characters.  The players had to deal with a choking haze of sawdust and (eventually) the warehouse collapsing around them to drop them into the murky waters of the harbor.  Junior Moppet drove the story hard by narrating all sorts of setbacks for her thief Mist.<br/><br/>I imagine I'll have to do more prep geared at providing hooks and addressing identified flags for both groups.  The Dungeon Girls have definitely made an enemy of the Cult of the Demon Klash'tuu, for instance.  They're quite gleeful about that, so I expect the cult will become an ongoing nemesis.  Oh yeah, I do try to prep treasure, if only to offer interesting magical items and make sure everyone eventually gets to grab something cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393113/#Comment_393113" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T10:24:26+00:00" title="October 11, 2012 10:24AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm impressed that you say your youngest daughter drives the story hard by narrating setbacks.

Junior Bestie is playing Rhavaniel the Ranger (her name gleaned from the Story Games Names book, which both groups consider exceedingly cool).  Mist enters the warehouse stealthily (mixed success).  The brass, multi-armed Golem doesn't notice her, but notices Amber and Rhavaniel at the front door, so it begins to saw and chaw wood.  It can't move since it's mounted on a heavy base without means of locomotion.  A moment later it opens its mouth and begins to shoot huge splinters of wood at the intruders and around the room generally, sort of like a lawn sprinkler.  As it does so, clouds of sawdust billow from its vents.<br/><br/>Mist dives for an overturned table to use as a shield against the flying splinters.  She does so (success), but then narrates that the clouds of sawdust are making it impossible to see, further that she's having a hard time breathing because the sawdust is so thick there.  She proceeds to narrate how Mist can't breathe and passes out while the maddened machine is tearing the building apart for ammo.  This was all Junior Moppet, not prompted by me other than my description of the saw golem and its actions.<br/><br/>Tying a wet scarf over her mouth and nose, Rhavaniel attempts a daredevil rescue.  She races in through the front door and (success) tumbles from post to post and around slashing mechanical arms to reach the fallen Mist.  Once there, she heaves Mist onto her back and (partial success) dodges the saws that tear up that part of the floor, but as the saw golem cuts up a support beam, the entire warehouse collapses under the golem's weight, casting everyone into the murky waters of the harbor.<br/><br/>The golem sinks like a rock, out of scene.  Wreckage and debris spills around the two characters, and Rhavaniel swims to avoid it and reach the surface, but (partial success) loses her grip on the unconscious Mist.  I'm ready to have Mist drifting away into the murk and get ready for another roll to see if the ranger can retrieve her--<br/><br/>But Junior Moppet gleefully declares that a giant piece of debris thumps into Mist and carries her into the cold depths of the lake.  Rhavaniel's player actually gasped on hearing this, and grabbed for the dice to try another desperate rescue.  Things looked pretty grim, and Junior Moppet was beaming.<br/><br/>Now, she was also playing the Wizard, who was still waiting outside, and even though neither of Amber's spirits had domains suitable to this situation, Junior Moppet decided after a little OOC discussion to try to summon something else to help.<br/><br/>"A river spirit of some kind?" I asked.<br/><br/>"A river DRAGON!" she shot back. "A big one!"<br/><br/>OK, so she made her roll, successfully summoned a huge Chinese-style water dragon who towered over her and got all haughty-like.  You know, the whole "who DARES summon ME?" 'tude.  I ask if Amber is going to negotiate or take a firm hand with this thing.  Junior Moppet notices Amber has Command, so she replies, "I just TELL it how things are gonna be."  Then she adopts a (for her) deep and commanding tone--her Batman voice--and essentially tells the spirit to get the fuck down there and rescue Mist RIGHT GODDAMN NOW (my idiom here, not hers).  I don't remember what exactly she said, but it was something like "Go and rescue my friend Mist and bring her here to me safe, and <i>*don't mess around*!"</i><br/><br/>Her roll comes to a solid 11, so while not a crit, I have the dragon obey and affect a somewhat chastised air, sort of "Whoa, I didn't know it was YOU.  Of course I'll help, yessiree."  With a crit, the dragon might have apologized with a free summoning token or maybe even become one of her "permanent" spirits.<br/><br/>So Mist is rescued, the dragon dismissed, and the city guard finally shows.  But they're polite, 'cause, you know, they saw the freakin' DRAGON there a moment ago.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393135/#Comment_393135" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T12:51:09+00:00" title="October 11, 2012 12:51PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!<br/><br/>1) The saw golem?

They were investigating a weird cult that sent assassins to try to kill them.  Possibly related to the Cult of Klash'tuu in the DG game.<br/><br/>2) I've been wondering that myself.  She was practically weaned on Justice League cartoons, then Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes, then Young Justice and Avatar, so I'm betting she believes her hero will survive and prevail no matter how bad things get--and she knows the best stories are those in which things get worse.  In other words, she's eight years old, and I bet character death or serious maiming is not on the table for her as part of the social contract.  It's not for me for any of them.  I'll beat them up, throw adversity at them, scare them, maybe scratch up their characters a little, but none of these kids' characters or pets will die unless they choose to let it happen.  I'm guessing that security gives Junior Moppet a lot of creative freedom to make things worse.<br/><br/>I sure as hell hope she <i>doesn't</i> think the GM is out to get her character.  That isn't the kind of game I want here, barring a little fun and cheesy veneer of competition now and then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393140/#Comment_393140" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T13:08:28+00:00" title="October 11, 2012  1:08PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 11, 2012 1:12PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting.

I think I even (wrongly) defined it that way once. While I now know that self-compromising is not the definition of a story game, I believe that once a game promotes self-compromising, it inherently becomes a story-game since the player is no longer role-playing and is instead story-playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393143/#Comment_393143" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T13:24:53+00:00" title="October 11, 2012  1:24PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Come to think of it, I did give her extra experience for making things interesting for Mist.<br/><br/>Yeah, kids are like mini-universities, aren't they?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393170/#Comment_393170" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T21:29:29+00:00" title="October 11, 2012  9:29PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome Blake, and sorta what I expected based on the APs, so now to the next question...<br/>As you develop the emerging world together, how to you funnel the sandbox? I'm sure the girls just know what they want to do next, but for instance, if an ancient temple dungeon is called for, do you choose one that appeals from the collection? Do you let the girls make a Lore roll and choose one of their own?

Based on what I'm seeing, I'd bet the girls would flail a bit, so I'm starting with some missions, just grabbing from cool maps that inspire me, throwing stuff at them.  Encouraging the girls to pick a direction and use Lore rolls to flesh things out would be ideal, but I suspect it'd be overwhelming for them right out of the gate.  It's kind of an emergent process.  If the girls really want to follow up with the demon cult, for example, I'll grab something likely from the stack and tie it to Klash'tuu.  I'm an adaptable human.<br/><br/>But right now, I'm focusing more on giving them a good time with some set pieces to get things rolling and give them a taste of action.  As they get into the world, they'll make connections with NPCs and places, and firm up their flags.  I've been asking them some questions about how they imagine pieces of the world work, so there's some potential for collaborative world-shaping (I hope).  But yeah, it's all training wheels stuff at present, as much for me as for them.<br/><br/>Oh, and we may have an actual boy join the group, one of their peers who really wants to dungeon.  I'm putting the idea to the table this weekend, and the girls will get to decide if they want to invite him in.

I asked them to choose one from each list, in the spirit of AW hacks everywhere. Hence: "Eldritch Labyrinth of Doom." I then improvised a dungeon around that theme. I've done it twice, the second time with adults, and they liked it too. So maybe that could help with the "where do you want to go next" thing. And since it's an ongoing game you could even cross out the words, and when they get to the final one, really play up how much of a doozy it's going to be. "Uh oh... looks like you're heading to the Ancient Oubliette of Foulness... watch out!"<br/><br/>Anyway just an idea I had.<br/><br/>BTW let me second everyone else's who's saying "This is awesome."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393389/#Comment_393389" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-14T20:21:16+00:00" title="October 14, 2012  8:21PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>That's really cool... but how does "Eldritch Labyrinth of Doom" give you something all that different to work with than "Ancient Oubliette of Foulness"?

I haven't asked her about it.  But in <i>Faery's Tale,</i> where she has only one character, she followed the same pattern of pushing adversity toward her character Thistle, evidently just for the hell of it.  That said, she was a little more cautious with Mist when she just had the one character, but mostly in terms of being careful about confronting monsters who could dish out HP damage.  Even then, when she fell to zero HP at one point (quickly healed by Elder Moppet's Druid), she didn't seem put out or subdued (unlike some adults I've played with).  I really don't know yet how much her dramatic play impulse is clashing with character survival urge.<br/><br/><b>Steve: </b>I haven't yet seen any frustration issues with failure in either group, though the Dungeon Girls notice at the end of the session how well they did across the entire session.  In yesterday's game, the Paladin (girl G) didn't really accomplish anything.  She had three rolls that were each a full success or crit, and they resulted in (a) severing a chain with one blow of her sword, freeing the new Necromancer PC girl A was introducing (swapping out her Guild Assassin as soon as the fiction allows); (b) climbing down a rope into a giant spider infested pit to support the Druid, Guild Assassin, and Necromancer, and (c) climbing the rope out of the pit to help the Ranger and Wizard confront an enraged gang of cultists.  I ruled that the crits let her arrive with a point of Hold and super intimidating stance.  Also, she had a partial success at using her Cure ability to cleanse a cultist curse from the Guild Assassin, and I ruled that she succeeded, but attracted the close attention of her deity (still to be defined) and her aura glowed with a noticeable white light.  G joked at the end of the session that all she accomplished on the day "was to <i>look</i> awesome."<br/><br/>Last session, when the Wizard (girl L) was frozen by her overzealous cold spirit, she seemed fine with the result.  Ranger (girl M) has also been fine with failure, though she's pretty anxious about her Lion.  Girl A remarks on how she did after each session, so I know each girl is aware of how much her character brought the awesome.  They did ask if they could spend Hold to reroll, but I said no.  I might let 3 Hold go for a reroll.  Incidentally, I found these cool plastic crystals, probably used to represent mana in Magic games, and I hand these out to represent Hold.  So far I've given Hold out for crit rolls, but I'm thinking about renaming them Awesome Points from OSH.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393448/#Comment_393448" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-15T10:23:21+00:00" title="October 15, 2012 10:23AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2012 9:05PM by Hexabolic.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Yesterday in Dungeon Girls: </b> They looted the temple shrine and found some cool stuff.  Wizard (Girl L) was late to arrive, so we started without her.  There was much negotiation, primarily handled by Girls G and L while A and Elder Moppet worked on A's new Necromancer character (you have to draw the character and all her stuff, and it's very important to get the hair right).  A wanted to play "an ironically cheerful Necromancer."  It was cute how she asked me if that'd be OK.  We made a rule for one character in play at a time, but also agreed a swap out had to make fictional sense.  So Guild Assassin is with us for the time being.  Nobody seems to mind, and nobody seems to have noticed that it dilutes their experience.  They've also voted to divvy up XP for monster battles evenly, with some standout awards for notable feats.<br/><br/>And by unanimous vote, they're cool for the Boy to join the next session if he wants.  They still want the group to be named Dungeon Girls for now, although Elder Moppet has tactfully offered the name Dungeoneers if they want to be gender-neutral in future.<br/><br/>The negotiation over loot was really interesting.  All the girls except A were very concerned about equity, to the point of refusing items because someone else hadn't gotten enough yet.  A wasn't selfish, just focused on getting dark Necromancy items.  They immediately decided to divide up Coin evenly.  Paladin didn't mind that the scale armor wouldn't fit quite right (-1 to DEX) until he was able to visit an armorer.  His player, G, felt awkward about taking both armor and the masterwork sword they found, but was ultimately persuaded that as the party "meat shield," the Paladin should get first pick of warrior stuff.  That term came up spontaneously from one of the girls, I don't recall who.  Eventually everyone got something and seemed satisfied, though I think the Wizard got stiffed a bit (no magic items, lots of quicksilver).  When Necromancer eventually discovered the spider-marked black leather bracers granted the wearer the narrow skill <i>Scale Sheer Surface,</i> all the girls oohed and ahhed about how cool that was.  I stressed that someone needed to do the bookkeeping because I wasn't going to go through all my notes to track their treasure.  Elder Moppet had to be reminded of her bracers of protection (+1 armor), for instance.<br/><br/>Elder Moppet leveled her Druid to Level 3 and chose a new skill and took Wild for her new Special Ability.  Everyone else got to Level 2.  Paladin was 25 XP short of 1,000, so the girls implored for me to make up the difference and asked if they could share XP to help Paladin over the hump.  What can I say?  I'm a softy.  I gave her the XP, but assigned her the homework of naming her deity and choosing three Domains for it. <br/><br/>After finishing at the shrine, they found the imprisoned Necromancer and freed her, then explored the building, eventually discovering the "dungeon" entrance in the basement, sealed by a copper plate engraved with mystic sigils.  After the Paladin tried to lift it and (failure) was hurled away by demonic power, taking a few HP and losing her glowing aura, the Necromancer used a ritual to open it.<br/><br/>In exploring, they ended up in the pit trap situation I mentioned above, the Necromancer having been snatched down there by a darkness spirit.  The Druid called her flame spirit Koriander to banish the darkness spirit, and Koriander (crit) devoured its opposition, a phoenix swallowing a serpent of shadow.  I've decided this spirit is going to have a bit of attitude, especially about darkness, since this is the second game running where Koriander has crushed the cult's darkness spirits.  Druid climbed a rope down into the pit to help Necromancer, but (partial success) woke the nest of giant spiders clustered on the ceiling.<br/><br/><i>At this point, while I was thinking about what move to make for the partial success, someone joked about giant spiders, girl A expressed her distaste for spiders, G warned everyone not to give me ideas, and Elder Moppet said she'd fought them before in the wizard's tower.  So of course, there had to be giant spiders.  :-)</i><br/><br/>The Druid made it down safely after stabbing the first spider to death on her way down.  Following some inspiration from the Die of Fate, I rolled about 20 of these things, figuring this encounter would make a decent set-piece.  Here is where things got <i>interesting,</i> and we learn that EM has the makings of a brilliant strategist.<br/><br/>As the spider horde descends, Paladin comes down the rope to look awesome and give the party a few seconds of breathing room.  Everyone is girding for battle when the Druid remembers she has Wild and can talk to animals.<br/><br/>"Does that include spiders?" she asks.<br/><br/>"Yeah," I reply.  "They're not unnatural monsters or domesticated critters."<br/><br/>"OK, I try to talk them into letting us go, and I apologize for killing that one guy."<br/><br/>The Druid makes her pitch and (partial success), the big fat queen cob hangs there in thought and then hisses that she will let the humans go if one of them stays to be eaten.  The girls gasp in delighted alarm and outrage.  Unacceptable!<br/><br/>Then EM gets inspired.  "Oh great spider queen, what if we bring you other meals to substitute for one of us?"  That would be acceptable, says the cob queen, but she warns that no one here may leave, and that she and her brood are hungry and don't want to wait long.<br/><br/>The Druid shouts up to the Ranger and Wizard to "go find some cultists and lead them back here."  Ranger and Wizard venture off.  Ranger uses her Scout special ability as she explores and finds a couple of dozen cultists having a heated discussion about the "slaughter in the shrine above."  She and Wizard, prompted by some questions by me, come up with a Cunning Plan.  Wizard uses her Throw Voice cantrip to (success) taunt the cultists and direct their attention to Ranger, who shows herself riding her LION and then (success) affects a limping gait back toward the cave with the pit, leading the cultists on.  Wizard runs back to the cave, stands on the far side of the pit, and uses her Shadow cantrip to hide the gaping hole.  Ranger shows up with the dagger-waving cultists in tow, has her lion spring over the pit, then dismounts.  The cultists charge in and a good half-dozen of them spill into the hidden pit before the others can pull back.<br/><br/>Down below, the spiders drop down and begin to feast in a gruesome scramble of glistening spiders, webs, and stunned cultists.  As the combat begins above, the ranger discovers the spear she grabbed as loot from the shrine is actually a Flaming Spear!  She and Wizard send a couple more wounded cultists into the pit, one of them bouncing off the Paladin, who is trying to climb the rope out of there.  Paladin rolls a crit and clambers out, grabbing a cultist by the ankle and pitching yet another corrupted soul down to arachnid justice.  The awesome pose he strikes, along with the screams of the dying spider food below and the flaming spear and the LION biting the head of their leader causes the remaining ten or so cultists to flee in panic.<br/><br/>The queen cob tells the Druid she is grateful for the feast and offers alliance while the humans are in these catacombs.  Elder Moppet is<i> psyched.</i><br/><br/>Nobody really embraced adversity in this group in Junior Moppet's fashion, but nobody seemed put out when things didn't go their way, either.  They're reacting with laughter, recognizing that setbacks are cool opportunities for them to bring the awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393449/#Comment_393449" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-15T10:29:39+00:00" title="October 15, 2012 10:29AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that sounds like a great session!<br/><br/>What do you use Hold/Awesome Points for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393450/#Comment_393450" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-15T10:35:58+00:00" title="October 15, 2012 10:35AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2012 3:48PM by Hexabolic.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right now I let the players spend Hold/Awesome points for a bonus on die rolls.

I'm pretty sure JM's willingness to throw adversity at her character is a relatively unique personality trait for a person her age.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393458/#Comment_393458" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-15T11:43:54+00:00" title="October 15, 2012 11:43AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JM is...pretty unique, I have to say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393460/#Comment_393460" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-15T11:47:26+00:00" title="October 15, 2012 11:47AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Though I will say that type of behavior is probably contagious.

C decided to make a Dwarf, because he likes Elfs and Dwarfs and had an Elf in the DnD game he'd played.  We basically took Fighter and swapped out Skirmish for Tinker.  He started with Tough and Tinker, and selected Decipher as his class skill.  He liked the name "Romrama" from the Imperial section of the WoD name list, so I suggested he be an "Imperial Dwarf," whatever that is.  He thought that sounded cool.  Romrama turns out to be tricky to wrap your mouth around <i>(dammit, John, you need to do a readaloud on this stuff before you release it to an unwitting public!  I mean, honestly... :-) ).</i><br/><br/>JM and S were excited to have him there.  They're all in the same third grade class, having started in Kindergarten together.  Both girls say they have a crush on C, but don't feel any rivalry about it.<br/><br/>I thought I'd start by having them encounter the dwarf in the dungeon.  I've been running the DK through a 1-page dungeon called Citadel of Fear, which is laid out so as to print out as a fold up booklet.  We'd left off in a sort of figure-8-shaped hallway section where the walls were lined with polite talking skulls.  I further decided to kick it off with some action, so a goblin patrol showed up while the dwarf and the party were located on perpendicular corridors.  Mist drew her elven sword and successfully caused fear on the onrushing goblins, halting half of them in their tracks.  A couple of goblins spotted the dwarf and split off to attack him.  Rhavaniel the ranger picked off a goblin with an arrow.  Amber the wizard slipped around the figure-8 to flank the goblins.  Lostariel the assassin met the goblin charge and killed one goblin while taking a painful javelin gash from another.<br/><br/>The dwarf turned and ran initially.  I think C was thinking about his other DnD game, wherein being outnumbered at first level was potentially a death sentence, but he turned on his own to make a stand after (partial failure) a goblin javelin hit him in the pants and delivered 1 HP of damage after we subtracted toughness.  I ruled the javelin had pierced his pants leg, so he couldn't run well until he pulled it out.<br/><br/>I'm really focusing on making the characters feel awesome even when they fail, so I'm pulling out the writerly description of action.  Romrama removed the javelin from his pant leg and decided to throw it back at the goblin charging him.  He failed, and I described how the goblin hurdled the javelin, which struck sparks from the stone floor.  The goblin dealt out a die of damage, but I rolled a 2, which was blocked by Romrama's Tough ability, so I described how the dwarf simply blocked the dagger slash with his unarmored forearm, because he was Just. That. Tough.  The next round, he whacked off the goblin's head with his axe.<br/><br/>Amber, meanwhile, had come around behind the dwarf in time to witness this feat of awesome.  JM had her swig some quicksilver and summon Arathiol, her Lightning/Fear spirit, who manifests as a wave of crackling lightning.  Amber ordered Arathiol to smite the other goblin, which it did with alacrity (15 damage on a 3d6 roll against a 3HP goblin, including a d6 bonus for the goblin's metal arms &amp; armor).  I narrated the blinding flash and clap of thunder as the goblin was hurled backward down the corridor to land in a charred and smoking heap at the feet of his buddies.  I figure Arathiol likes to be scary, even when it's using its Lightning domain.  All the kids oohed and aaahed at this.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394667/#Comment_394667" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T14:19:09+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  2:19PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2012 5:23PM by Hexabolic.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so the boy energy was pretty different in the Dungeon Kids group.  With three of them, the kiddos were up and around a lot more than when it was just JM and S.  C seemed to need to get up more often to demonstrate how Romrama was swinging his axe, accompanied by cool "ssshhhnk" SFX.  Honestly, though this is fun and endearing, I found it a bit tiring after awhile, because practically every action had to go on pause while C, and then JM and S, all got up to pantomime their combat moves.  Getting the kids back to the table and focused on the fiction took more time and overt management than I had had to do up until now.  But they were having a good time, so (deep breath) they finished off the hapless goblins, the Ranger nailing the last one with an arrow as it tried to flee the hall.<br/><br/>Looting the bodies-an activity that seems to come naturally to both groups-yielded a handful of coins and some used goblin javelins.  S and JM had some minor disagreement about how to divvy up the pitiful goblin savings, but eventually split it between the dwarf newcomer and the Lvl 1 Assassin, since those characters "needed it most."<br/><br/>There was a secret room marked on the map, so I gave them each a chance to roll, awarding a bonus to the dwarf.  This was mostly for effect, since I wasn't going to let them miss the room.  Anyway, they easily discovered the room and entered to find more stuff to loot.  Here's where JM and S ended up doing a lot more haggling over which characters needed XP the most.  In the end, they decided to split the coin evenly, and the scrolls went to the Wizard, and other stuff went to the other characters as seemed class-appropriate.  There wasn't a lot of adventuresome gear; this room was some hapless dead dude's office.  On the other hand, the dwarf had to be persuaded to take a simple helmet, apparently because he didn't envision it fitting under Romrama's floppy-brimmed rain hat.  The kids were clearly excited and tired and a bit distracted, so I gave them a break before we continued play.<br/><br/>When they came back, we had an hour left, so I decided to hit them with another set piece, this time a reinforced goblin patrol backed up by an Orc Wizard, an Orc Warrior, and an Orc Drummer whose drum made goblins brave.  There were 8 goblin warriors and two goblin archers.  To add an environmental complication, the wood golem corridor cleaner described in the dungeon text came along, moving robotically to clean up the carnage from the last goblin encounter.<br/><br/>The Dungeon Kids made mincemeat out of them.  Romrama just charged.  Mist drew her Elven sword and attacked.  Rhavaniel, like any good ranger, ran up to use the Wood Golem for cover while she plied her archery skills.  Lostariel slipped over to the corner and prepared to ambush any enemies that drew near.  Amber summoned her spirit <i>The Book of Ice</i> and caused a blizzard in the corridor intersection that slowed the goblin patrol's vanguard enough for Lostariel and Mist to wipe them out.<br/><br/>The Orc Drummer's work canceled out the effects of Mist's elven sword, but this hardly mattered.  The dwarf cleaved a goblin as he charged through their line, beelining for the drummer.  Mist also evaded the goblins and went for the Orc Warrior.  The Orc Wizard used his magic staff to create Goblin Zombies from the remains of the goblin patrol, adding some crappy zombies to the mix.<br/><br/>Next round, Mist attacked the Orc Captain and scored a crit with the elven sword.  She didn't do enough damage to kill him outright, but took him to 2HP.  For the crit, I ruled Mist took off the Orc's sword hand.  Meanwhile, the dwarf crits on the Drummer, doing enough for an outright kill.  I asked him how it goes down, and C describes how he chops the guy's head off (shades of Axe Cop).<br/><br/>"OK," I say.  "Black blood is everywhere, steaming on the cold floor.  Meanwhile, the Orc Wizard is summoning something like a giant hairy spider stitched together from inky shadows.  What do you do?"<br/><br/>JM has Amber call Arathiol again, and she simply tells it to<i> "Fry that wizard!"</i>  However, this is her fourth summoning (she'd done one last session), so she rolls for Quicksilver effect and gets a partial success.  JM volunteers that Amber succeeds in communicating her desire to Arathiol, but then passes out as the quicksilver runs cold as ice through her veins.<br/><br/>The Orc Wizard sees the lightning manifest and I have him order his spirit to intercept and kill.  JM rolls for Arathiol and I roll for Hairy Spider Shadow.  Again, JM rolls really well and I suck.  Arathiol simply blows through the other spirit and again I describe the clap of thunder and enthusiastic flash as Amber's spirit blasts its target.  The Orc Wizard is shocked down to 1HP as he peels himself off the floor where he landed, his robes scorched and licked with fire.<br/><br/>Both Romrama and Mist finish the Orc Warrior while the Assassin and Ranger pick off a zombie and goblin.  The rest of the goblins are fuuuuucked as Mist's elven sword (success) terrifies them into blind panic.  The Orc Wizard finds an intact vial of quicksilver, chugs it, and summons his darkness spirit again to exfil him before somebody gets to that one last little HP.<br/><br/>I describe the dark hairy spider unfolding from the ceiling to drape the Orc in shadows, when JM declares, "And shadowy webs come down and snatch up Amber too!  And she can't do anything because she's unconscious!"  So...<i>yeah.</i>  Amber is now a prisoner of the Orc Wizard.  It looks like I'll have to do some real prep for next time.<br/><br/>"We're ending on a cliffhanger!" JM announced proudly.  Yes, honey, yes we are.<br/><br/>I should add that I instantiated <i>Awesome Points</i> this session, giving them out on crits or when players made things especially tough for their characters.  Awesome Points could be used 1 for 1 to add to die rolls, offer the ability to make some narrative declarations, and we're exploring other possible uses, like healing HP 1 for 1.<br/><br/>That was it.  We got to the loot split and I released the kids to go frolic before their moms came to fetch them.  C had a lot to say (and demonstrate) to his mom as he talked about how awesome the game was, and she sent me an IM the next day to inform me he couldn't stop talking about how much fun he'd had.<br/><br/>Another successful session for WoD, but DK won't meet again until the 18th since I'm off to OryCon the first weekend in November.  This coming weekend, it'll be Dungeon Girls again, maybe with their own boy joining.  Advance word seems to be he's picking a Thief for that game.<br/><br/>JM told me later she thought this session had too much combat.  I kind of agree with her, but I'm not sure she and the other kids would have held still for exploration.  The novelty of having C in the group produced too much excited, fidgety energy.  We'll see if they're a bit more grounded next time.  In any case, I'm excited to see what happens with Amber.  I am kind of wishing each Kid stuck with one character, but I like both Amber and Mist very much, so I'd have a hard time figuring out which one I preferred.  JM plays them very differently.  Mist is the goddamn Batman, voice low and tough, while Amber is bright and cheery.  S plays her ranger and assassin virtually identically.  C is playing a tough dwarf asskicker, which implies its own personality right there.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394685/#Comment_394685" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T16:20:24+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  4:20PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this so, so much and never want the reading of it to end.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394704/#Comment_394704" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T21:14:07+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  9:14PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, me too.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I neglected to mention the slaughter of the remaining panicky gobs.

I think if it's a partial failure, I'm gonna just hit them with something odd and complicating, akin to Ars Magica Hermetic Flaws, likely related to the spirit's domains or personality.  If it's a full failure, I still want things to be awesome, so I'll probably have the spirit not get the right instruction and do something cool but off-base, or I'll hammer the Wizard with an Ars Magica Hermetic Side Effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395315/#Comment_395315" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T16:26:33+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  4:26PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we had Dungeon Girls yesterday, plus the new player F, a boy who joined with a fighter-thief mix he\u2019s calling an \u201cEscort\u201d for now.  The class appears to be a sort of mercenary with eclectic skills.  I\u2019d prefer he come up with a more evocative name, like Southron Mercenary or something, but it\u2019s fine if he sticks with the plainer term.<br/><br/>His character\u2019s name is <i><b>Niff</b></i>, and he has the class skill of <i>Stealth</i>, added <i>Awareness</i>, and took <i>Hardy</i> and <i>Tinker</i> for his starting special abilities.  A smallbow and and shortsword with some light armor and a smattering of gear completed his gear.  He was ready to go.<br/><br/>G seemed invested in knowing her paladin Arselon still had more hit points than the newcomer.  I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s proud of her designation as party \u201cmeat shield\u201d (her term, not mine).  They\u2019re also referring to the possessed priest from a couple of sessions back as \u201cSpooky Spooky Twisty Arm Guy,\u201d or something like that. (G is a huge Avatar: The Last Airbender fan).<br/><br/>We had to wait a little while for L to arrive with her wizard.  Logistics.  It seems her dad is interested in sitting in on a session, maybe playing an NPC.  Very cool!  I\u2019ll have to give that some thought so we can find a fun pickup role for him.<br/><br/>For a fictional tie-in, I decided Niff had been a prisoner of the cultists, who had caught him sniffing around their digs (maybe he was on a mission for a client) and were preparing to sacrifice him to Klash\u2019tuu.  When they all took off in chase of the ranger mounted on her lion, he slipped out a hidden lockpick and freed himself from his manacles.  After retrieving his gear, he was on the way out when the panicked cultists fleeing the slaughter and spider trap ran into him.  He killed one (no roll, as this was just for flavor), the other scattering as he made his way to the room where the other party members were looting the meager pickings of the dead cultists.<br/><br/>This week, the group had a lot of squirrelly energy, particularly from A and Elder Moppet, who were pretty chattery.  It was hard to get the players focused, and we kept having to go back over the scene to stage things.  I talked with EM afterwards, and she suggested it might be nice to have some social time before we start the game, to give everyone some hang out time and ease into play.  This sounds sensible to me.<br/><br/>After some wrangling, we decided A\u2019s Guild Assassin had to leave so A could focus her energy on playing her ironically cheery necromancer <i>Andromeda Payne.</i>  EM and A have a friend whose last name is Payne, which these girls think is the coolest thing evar.  They are fans of the quite droll <i>Skullduggery Pleasant</i> series.  Anyway, the group sent Fox, the assassin, out to deliver a message to the city authorities warning them of the existence of this evil cult\u2019s stronghold.  Bam.  Pretextual exit accomplished.<br/><br/>We started with some basic looting of the cultist bodies, but that yielded nothing but bloodstained robes and a handful of silvers.  Then Niff showed up, and we went through a hesitant, self-conscious introduction scene.  Awkward because Valavanora the Druid, Andromeda the Necromancer, and Fox the Guild Assassin were still down in the spider pit witnessing arachnoid suckage.  EM and A weren\u2019t in the scene above, so they were distractingly talky with each other.  Nobody introduced themselves by name except Arselon the Paladin and Niff himself.  But we got through it.  Everyone\u2019s relatively new to roleplaying, with the exception of A and maybe L.<br/><br/>At this point, I should say I made a few comments this session about players needing to be a good audience.  Honestly, I\u2019m trying not to be the dad here offering a stream of behavioral feedback, but I also want to encourage good gaming habits.  I had to take a deep breath and try to move things forward with gentle reminders.<br/><br/>More later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395328/#Comment_395328" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T19:34:45+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  7:34PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395413/#Comment_395413" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T13:35:47+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  1:35PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2012 3:02PM by Hexabolic.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After introductions, we flailed a bit while the party tried to figure out what to do next. I call it \u201cflailing\u201d because A and EM were still distracted, none of the kids seemed clear on how to introduce Niff to the Necromancer and Druid, who were still below witnessing the gruesome spider Thanksgiving.<br/><br/>In looking at the map I was using for them, another 1 Page Dungeon called <i>The Temple of Thime,</i> a beautiful little art piece with evocative notes but nothing definitive, I saw the spider room had another exit to a room containing a stone sarcophagus and a cryptic note about Dead stuff being here.  I decided to throw something new and different at them, so I described the sound of stone grating against stone, and had the Necromancer make an Awareness roll.  The notion was to hit them with a Wraith, a serious piece of Undead business that wouldn\u2019t go down to a flurry of blades and arrows.  Fictionally, I figured the terror and death of the cultists had stirred the dreaded Wraith from slumber.  I assigned it 20 HP, immunity to normal weapons, Death\u2019s Chill, and some kind of Cause Fear ability. I also had the murky idea that it could drain HP to add to its own, but I wasn't consistent about applying that, which was probably for the best given how things went down.<br/><br/>So: Andromeda called out that something was wrong, Death\u2019s Door opening and all that.<br/><br/>In perception rolls, I\u2019m going with the DW take as guidance: full success means useful information, partial success means interesting but not immediately useful info.  Andromeda sensed <i>(partial success)</i> the cold breath of Death\u2019s door opening nearby.  Valavanora was fixing to climb the rope and get the heck out of there when the Wraith appeared, manifesting as a ghostly skeleton robed in shadows.  Valavanora <i>(failure)</i> found herself halted by the Wraith\u2019s chill presence, frost riming her skin, unable to move.  I tossed out an observation that Death\u2019s power was diametrically opposed to the Druid\u2019s Nature focus, and perhaps Valavanora was more vulnerable to Undead magics.<br/><br/>Andromeda <i>(success)</i> wasn\u2019t affected, and decided \u201cHey, I\u2019m a Necromancer.  Can I talk to this thing?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cSure,\u201d I replied.  \u201cMake a Charisma roll.  What are you going to try to do?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cTalk to it and see if I can convince it to leave us alone.\u201d<br/><br/>Incidentally, I\u2019d decided to give Andromeda a +1 bonus in dealing with Undead, because of the narrower focus in her magics.  Similiarly, the Druid gets a +1 dealing with Nature spirits.<br/><br/>When Andromeda started to parley, speaking the Tongue of the Dead, the Wraith <i>(partial success)</i> halted, but loomed larger as its hunger grew.  The other characters decided they needed to come down to provide backup.  Everyone started down the rope.  True to form, Arselon<i> (crit)</i> came down looking awesome.  Niff also rolled a crit, so dropped down ready to rumble.  Arian asked about lowering her still nameless lion, but ultimately decided not to because she didn\u2019t want to risk him against a Wraith.  I\u2019d also pointed out that it wouldn\u2019t be a simple or quick operation.<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019m not sure his claws would hurt a thing like this, anyway,\u201d she said.  \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019d get him out of here.\u201d<br/><br/>So the lion stuck around up top on guard.  By this time, the wizard Sklarah <i>(crit)</i> came down and landed in a lithe stance, quicksilver vial in hand.  The spiders, meanwhile, were busy hauling their meals up, up, and away so the Wraith couldn\u2019t slurp the cultists\u2019 life force before the spiders were done.<br/><br/>I called for Andromeda to make a roll to persuade the Wraith to leave them alone.  The Wraith<i> (failure)</i> shrieked and swept forward, extending spectral claws toward the Necromancer.  I had her roll against CON to resist or evade, and she <i>(success)</i> pulled out a talisman or executed some kind of quick, one-handed \u201cavert\u201d ritual to deflect the Wraith.<br/><br/>Things got a little hectic at this point, so my recollection is a bit garbled.  I\u2019ll do the best I can to reconstruct.<br/><br/>Niff, Arian, and Arselon attacked, Arselon with her sword, Niff and Arian shooting arrows.  These attacks did nothing but pass through the Wraith as if it were made of smoke, and I treated them as failed rolls.  This result caused bafflement and more anxiety.  Meanwhile, the Wraith grabbed Arselon and started draining his life force to the tune of something like 9 of his 20HP in that first round, which ratcheted the tension level way up.<br/><br/>Valavanora shook off her fugue and summoned <i>Koriander</i>, her redoubtable Phoenix green fire elemental.  Koriander did a solid and dramatic dozen or so points against the Wraith, spearing it with a winged blast of emerald flame for 12HP.  The undead thing let loose of Arselon, backed off and emitted the patented ringwraith shriek (which I am pretty good at delivering, incidentally).  All the characters had to save against fear.  Everyone <i>(success or partial)</i> did, except <i>(failure) </i>Arselon, who, doubtless still chilled by the Wraith\u2019s touch, found himself unable to move.  This was a bit deprotagonizing, I suppose, but G seemed to be a good sport, and with the party meat-shield out of action, everyone else had to step up.<br/><br/>Andromeda asked if she could use Ritual to create a circle of protection centered around the rope, so they\u2019d have an escape route.  I said sure, but<i> (die of fate) </i>it\u2019d take her 3 rounds, and it couldn\u2019t be broken once invoked <i>(<span style="text-decoration: underline;">edit</span>: meaning nobody had better scuff the marks or otherwise cover the circle, or it would be rendered useless)</i>.  Sklarah asked if she could help, and I said sure, a successful Aid roll would add +1 to Andromeda\u2019s Ritual roll.  Fortunately, Sklarah was learned enough in her Lore <i>(success) </i>to understand the Necromancer\u2019s cryptic directions.  As the two mages worked on the circle, the rest of the group tried to hold off the Wraith.<br/><br/>Arian mused that she didn\u2019t know if she could do much, so I reminded her she had a flaming spear that could still be used in two combats that day.<br/><br/>\u201cReally?\u201d she said.  \u201cI didn\u2019t think it worked that way.\u201d  So she called out the magic word engraved on the spearhead and charged.  She<i> (partial success)</i> dealt another 7HP to the Wraith, who pulled back in rage and shrieked out what Andromeda recognized as a call for reinforcements I determined would<i> (die of fate) </i>arrive in 5 rounds.  She shouted a warning to the party that time was short, and continued to scrawl arcane symbols on the floor and yell directions at Sklarah.<br/><br/>I should point out that A drew out her circle on paper, which was pretty cool.  Shades of Garth Nix\u2019s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sabriel</span>.  The Wraith was down to 1HP, a mere shade of its initial might.  Things looked good, but the battle wasn't done yet.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395414/#Comment_395414" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T13:36:28+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  1:36PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2012 1:39PM by Hexabolic.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Throughout this encounter, F was trying to have Niff offer tactical leadership without being too pushy.  He continued to suggest ideas and ask what the other characters had on them.  He observed that fire hurt this thing, so L examined her character sheet and realized she had several vials of fire oil.<br/><br/>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Niff said.  He and Arian tried to decide how best to use the vials they got from Sklarah, eventually deciding to shoot flaming arrows at the Wraith, lit by Sklarah\u2019s candle cantrip.  They had some more elaborate idea that sounded as though it would take them several rounds to set up, and after I pointed that out, they went with the simpler fire arrow plan.<br/><br/>G asked if Arselon could pray for intervention from his deity.  I said sure, and Arselon stammered out a petition that <i>(failure) </i> his god or goddess did not hear, but the dark powers the Wraith served did, and lent it strength in the form of (2d6) 10HP, bringing it back to 11.  This was harsh, but I didn't want to simply slam Arselon for more damage right away.<br/><br/><i>I have to stress that even though Arselon was not having a great day, G continued to be a good sport, as all these kids have been, and I'm really grateful.  I ought to start giving out Awesome Points for good sportsmanship, seriously.  I mean, I've played with players who sulked or got pissy after their character hit a setback or heaven forfend, died.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not</span> fun.</i><br/><br/>Niff's flaming arrow knocked the Wraith down to 6HP as it grabbed for Arselon again.  A second arrow from Arian <i>(partial success)</i> did 1HP, and I initially ruled it had hit (low roll of a d6 for each of the players) Andromeda, possibly disrupting the ritual.  F raised an eyebrow, and the other players looked a bit puzzled.  I realized I had not clarified everyone\u2019s relative location, and further that I had it wrong.  The Wraith and Andromeda were on opposite sides of the battle, so it was highly unlikely a missed arrow would do anything.  I ruled instead that the arrow hit Arselon, whose armor soaked some of it, but he still took some damage from Arian\u2019s wayward arrow.  M expressed dismay that she'd hurt a fellow party member.<br/><br/>As the Wraith grasped at Arselon, seeking to add his strength to its own (HP), Valavanora called on Koriander again, but this time, the Druid was on her fourth summoning of the day, having called the spirit once in each of the last two sessions.  The icy quicksilver <i>(failure)</i> shut her down so that she garbled her order to the fire spirit before passing out.  Confused, Coriander split its attack and rolled a d6 against <i>(die of fate)</i> Arian (I think) for 1HP and then <i>(die of fate)</i> another against the Wraith for 2HP.  The Wraith is down to 3HP and about to go down on Arselon again in a bad way.<br/><br/>At this point, and I don\u2019t know who suggested it, L asked me if Sklarah could drink fire oil and spray it across her cantrip-ignited candle flame held in her palm to attack the Wraith.  I said (essentially) <i>HELL</i> yeah.  I mean, really.  This is the awesome, right?<br/><br/>She <i>(success)</i> stepped up and breathed a wad of fire right through the Wraith\u2019s spectral face, rolling 4HP.  Everyone cheered (in relief, I observed) as the Wraith burned away to scraps of shadow and silence.  Everyone demanded that Sklarah get Awesome Points for this, despite not rolling a crit.  I handed them out happily.<br/><br/><b>More later:</b> a harrowing escape from the spider pit, an unsettling encounter, lessons about story prep and campaign direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395422/#Comment_395422" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T14:26:07+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  2:26PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, your crew has definitely shown that they are good sports.

They've been amazing, really.  Creative and engaged, except for a bit of squirrely energy from EM and A up front.  Elder Moppet suggested afterward that having some social time before the game starts might be a good way of working out the extra excitement, as opposed to starting the game immediately on the arrival of the last Dungeon Girl.  Common sense from a seventh grader.  Social time needs to be a part of this experience.<br/><br/>I don't know that they realized how hard I was hitting them.  The Wraith dealt 2d6 damage, could cause fear, and wasn't susceptible to normal weapons.  Good thing Sklarah made a Lore roll to determine wraiths are vulnerable to fire (something I'd forgotten to add above).<br/><br/>By the way, I love-love-<i>LOVE</i> narrating spirit effects in this game.  The spirit-based magic system is fun, versatile, powerful, and flavorful.  If we ever port this to Dungeon World, I'm going to have to finagle the WoD magic in place of the DW one.<br/><br/>By the way, I'd shared with EM some of the feedback folks have offered on this thread, along with the (to me) surprising number of views, and she got so excited that she shared with the other Dungeon Girls.  Subsequently, at least three of the group are reading this.  F had found it on his own, googling World of Dungeons.  I warned the girls and their parents that I had employed some adult language here and there, but everyone's OK with it.  You'll find my posts going forward won't be quite so salty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395458/#Comment_395458" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T15:59:18+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  3:59PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Jason, Andy: </b>Thanks.

These were like lesser wraiths, similar abilities, just not as tough or scary.  But numbers, numbers...<br/><br/>Fortunately, Andromeda had continued her circle of protection, as several of the players remembered the Wraith\u2019s shriek, and the Necromancer guessed correctly there would be more stuff coming.  She finished invoking her circle just before the Shadows flowed into the room, and <i>(success) </i>broke like a wave on the activated circle.<br/><br/>The group helped Andromeda boost a roll from a failure to a full success by donating their Awesome Points, but I don\u2019t remember if it was this roll or a later one.  In any case, it was cool to see them pull together like that.<br/><br/>After a brief introduction of Niff to Valavanora and Andromeda, marked by the ironically cheerful Necromancer being super perky and bubbly, they all decided to get the bejeebers out of there.  I asked if they were worried on account of the spiders.  The Druid said yes, they didn\u2019t want the Shadows to steal the hard won cultist Happy Meal, and several in the group wavered for a moment, torn by a truly odd squick of conscience, but Arselon issued a flat \u201cNo,\u201d and everyone nodded.  The spiders were on their own.<br/><br/>Arian the Ranger was the first one to <i>(success)</i> shinny up the rope, and discussion ensued about who should go next.  As the Shadows keened and pressed against the circle, the Necromancer did my job for me.  A warned the other players repeatedly that they needed to get out while the circle held, 'cause it might be broken somehow.  A conveniently blood-drunk spider tumbled down from above and went splat close enough to the circle to underline the threat.<br/><br/>Sklarah (I think) went next, because--in her words--she was light and <i>(partial success) </i>discovered all this shuttling up and down was fraying the rope against the lip of the pit.  Suspense spiked as everyone tried to think of what to do next.  <i>It turned out no one else had rope.</i>  Niff the Escort had purchased a grappling hook but no rope to go with it, an omission I found quietly hilarious.<br/><br/>After some rueful comments about what they needed to buy when they resupplied--<i>rope!</i>--it was decided Valavanora would go up next.  She succeeded, and Arian cut the frayed bit off and retied the rope.  This shortened the rope enough that the characters below would have to jump for it, increasing the fictional risk of mishap.  Arselon volunteered to go last and give someone else his armor so he wouldn\u2019t be so heavy.  Andromeda nixed this idea because she was the Necromancer and had to go last.  I don\u2019t remember who did what, but eventually everyone got out.  Here is where I *think* the Awesome Points really got spent: on helping Andromeda get out before dirt and debris dislodged by all the climbing and spider feasting marred the circle of protection.  She'd rolled a failure with a 5, and someone asked if they could chip in Awesome Points to help her, and then everyone was doing it, scraping out a 10 for a full success.<br/><br/>Andromeda was hoisted out safely and the Shadows were left whining for souls.  Whew.<br/><br/>Here we had about an hour left to go in the session, and we decided the party would explore a little farther.  The players discussed leaving \u201cto go shopping,\u201d but when I mentioned the possibility of loot, they--esp. Arselon, Niff, and Arian--voted to delve a bit deeper.  EM in particular expressed disappointment.  She was hoping for more social time, I think, but I\u2019ll debrief on that in a bit.<br/><br/>After resuming their Klash\u2019tuu cultist disguises of black robes and medallions, hey ventured down a corridor and entered an unlit room where a hulking figure stood in the corner.  It turned out to be a half-ogre-ish guy in rags.  He looked fierce at first blush, but when they came in, bearing torches, he cowered in the corner and moaned in fear, saying stuff like, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt Nunk.  Nunk sorry!  Nunk never do it again...!\u201d and they saw the heavy manacles securing him to the wall.<br/><br/>Wariness turned to sympathy, as several girls went, \u201cAwww...\u201d and started talking about helping Nunk and maybe \u201cmaking him a pet.\u201d  The rest of the session went toward coaxing Nunk to eat some of their rations (CHA rolls) and freeing him.  The Paladin stepped up brandishing his sword and (partial success) cut the poor bastard\u2019s chains.  At first I ruled the sword cut the chain but broke, but G pointed out that this was a Masterwork sword that didn\u2019t break.  Ah.  Yeah.  Spaced that.  I amended my judgment to Nunk conceiving a lasting terror of Arselon, and then M\u2019s mom showed up, so we closed the curtain there.<br/><br/>F shook his head and said he just realized he could have picked the locks on Nunk\u2019s manacles.  I said, yeah, you could have, but you need time to remember all the stuff your character can do.<br/><br/>As she was about to leave, M asked me, \u201cHow do you <i>do</i> this?  I mean, do you figure out all the possible ways it could go ahead of time?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWell...it\u2019s kind of like jazz,\u201d I said.  \u201cImprov acting, adjusting to what other people are doing, listening to what they're saying.  Plus I\u2019ve been doing this for *cough* over thirty years.  I've had a lot of practice, but I'm still learning.\u201d<br/><br/>This was the point where I fielded a number of questions about this thread, so I told them where to go to read it, and warned M\u2019s mom that I\u2019d written it for grown-ups, so there was some \u201cadult language\u201d in my recounting.  Everyone was cool with that, to my relief.  I didn\u2019t need to jump online and redact all my references to M\u2019s lion.<br/><br/>I gave F a ride home.  He\u2019s a quiet kid, grounded and self-possessed, an athlete who plays a ton of soccer.  I figured he\u2019d had a good time, but he was hard to read.  As he got out of the car, I held up two fingers.<br/><br/>\u201cTwo weeks, we do this again?\u201d<br/><br/>He nodded, made to close the door, then paused.  \u201cI wish we could do it more often.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cMe too,\u201d I told him.  \u201cLet\u2019s see how it goes, OK?\u201d<br/><br/>Back at the ranch, I debriefed with EM, and she said she was tired of the dungeon and its darkness. It felt confining.  She wants to go out and adventure in the woods and fight something like a giant boar.  (We\u2019re big Asterix the Gaul fans here.)  There\u2019s a reason she picked the Druid, I guess.  But beyond that, she felt there was too much combat, maybe not enough other adventure.  F had mentioned in the car on the way to his house how he\u2019d like to encounter traps.<br/><br/>I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve gotten too reliant on seat-of-the-pants combat set pieces.  The sense I have now from some of the comments around the table was that the players are ready for more engagement with some kind of story.  During the in-character discussion after escaping the spider pit, Arian and Sklarah reminded the other characters how the wizard NPC had sent them on a quest to retrieve the Fire Jewels.  Some of the characters are wondering if this cultist adventure is distracting them from this quest.<br/><br/>I do have a quest idea in mind, but haven\u2019t wanted to railroad.  On the other hand, I think the time has come for me to put a bit more structure down and let the players find their own comfort level between sandbox and plot.  This game and probably the DK game will need some more prep than I\u2019ve given it thus far.  Oh darn.<br/><br/>For starters, I may have to revise the character sheets to include Awesome Points, provide a section devoted to loot, and make a second sheet for wizardly types and their spirits.  There might need to be a brief section for key descriptive traits and a main personality trait....like \u201cironically cheerful.\u201d<br/><br/>It\u2019s neat that WoD lends itself so well to being built on.  It\u2019s turning out to be a great foundation.  Last spring, I\u2019d gifted my 4e books to F and his brother.  After the WoD session, F shook his head.<br/><br/>\u201cJust too many rules,\u201d he said, referring to 4e.  \u201cKind of overwhelming.\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395501/#Comment_395501" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T20:55:15+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  8:55PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just pulled Nunk out of whole cloth, incidentally.

I knew Arselon had a boatload of HP, so this wasn't really putting him in immediate jeopardy.  It also did a goodly amount of damage to the Wraith.  But looking back, it would have been better to pierce Arselon's armor and gear instead and still pin the Wraith to him.<br/><br/>You make some good calls, you make some not-as-good calls.  I'm still trying to find the right line between partial success and failure.  The list that some folks posted here of examples of "soft" v. "hard" moves has been helpful, but I'm a long way from mastering it.  What I find is that I'm still framing setbacks too much in light of the task at hand, rather than looking at the task but opening it up to other circumstances that aren't necessarily causally connected to the player's action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395984/#Comment_395984" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T22:36:02+00:00" title="November  2, 2012 10:36PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think the narrative consequences are far more interesting than the damage itself.

Whew.  Will post about it this week.  Highlights that come to mind were: (1) the Paladin and Necromancer being cut off from the rest of the group by a mysterious cave-in, and then attacked by a Wraith,  (2) a pitched battle with Skitterling Demogoblins in a crossroad dungeon hallway that nearly resulted in a TPK, (3) successful implementation of Conditions as a house rule, and (4) Elder Moppet's Druid dying and rolling snake eyes when defying the icy grasp of Death, which given John's last post above, definitely wins the Irony Award.

They wanted a rockfall to separate them from the rest of the party, because they wanted a scene wherein they could bring out some backstory they'd worked up between their characters, the Paladin and the Necromancer.  I agreed to engineer something for them.  I had some concern about splitting the party, but we'd already effectively done that in the room with the spiders a couple of sessions ago, so I wasn't worried.  I figured I'd do it when the Die of Fate rolled a 1, which I would test for in each movement phase.<br/><br/>We started by introducing the Cleric, whose fictional reason for being in the dungeon was that he'd been sent to investigate this cult, had come in through a back entrance and gotten himself lost.  After some introductions and a bit of amusing roleplay as the Necromancer tried (failure) to shush Nunk ("SURE! NUNK BE QUIET!  NUNK GOOD AT BEING QUIET!"), they set out to explore.  The Cleric said he'd passed some prisoner cells and wanted to return that way to free the unfortunate souls held there.  So they set the order of march and proceeded into the unknown.<br/><br/>I had brought a laminated paper the size of a small poster to use as a map, and this worked really well, giving us enough room to map the dungeon while also leaving space to detail tactical positioning.  I'd also fleshed out rules on torches and light ripped from the thread about the BWHQ's dungeoneering game, and these worked really well to reinforce the mood and make light a real issue.  The kids thought it was cool that they could run out of light and be stranded in the darkness.<br/><br/>As it happens, the rockfall Die of Fate came up '1' right away.  A spirit effect worked as a trap, collapsing a corridor over them.  Everyone rolled to get the heck out of the way, and since A and G had positioned themselves at the rear along with Nunk, the separation they wanted worked out naturally.  A asked to have a hurt leg, and they ended up on one side of an impassable pile of rubble, stranded with the panicky Nunk.  The rest of the party made it out scathed, as the Cleric Lucius took a blow from a rock that knocked him out, and a few characters suffered some minor HP damage.  The stones were too big for them to move, and the magic users, who had already gone over their quicksilver level limit from previous sessions, weren't eager to take any more of the drug to call in spiritual FEMA aid.  After some dilatory picking at the rubble, Sklarah the Wizard used her Throw Voice cantrip to tell the other side to sit tight and try to free themselves "if they were still alive."  The party would return for them when it could.<br/><br/>Apparently, while the major portion of the party debated as to what to do next, and the Druid healed the unconscious Cleric, the Necromancer and Paladin had their talky scene.  I totally missed it, and so did the rest of the group, which was a pity.  As a group, we are still trying to find the right balance of audience v. player.  EM was busy drawing characters for G and F, and wasn't tuned in as much as she could have been.  M turns out to be a really engaged player, and she and J (L's dad) were the ones providing leadership on that side.  F is quiet, but he also had plenty to say about how to proceed, just in a more low-key way.<br/><br/>As the main party moved along, I noticed the map showed a sarcophagus in a dead end room on the Paladin/Necromancer side.  The Die of Fate came up '2', so I described a scraping stone sound and a breath of cold air.  Everyone at the table gasped and several called out, "Oh no, not another Wraith!"<br/><br/>Die of Fate said...?  1--a Wraith!  I described the skeletal form coming down the corridor toward them, glowing with fell light as its cloak of shredded shadows writhed behind it.  Arselon drew his sword, and I said, "Ah, the sword that totally failed to hit the last Wraith?"<br/><br/>"Oh...yeah," G said.<br/><br/>"You guys are in so much trouble!" someone cried.<br/><br/>That's when Andromeda the Necromancer decided to call one of her spirits, Vaylon the Silent, who had the Domain of Death.  She called upon him to grant the Paladin's sword the ability to mete out Death to the Dead.  Die of Fate said the effect would last three rounds.  In retrospect, I should have let Andromeda roll that as part of her effect, but I'd been leaning heavily on the Die of Fate already this game, so I was quick on the trigger.<br/><br/>G made the rueful comment, "Gosh, I wish I'd taken Turn for my Special Ability."<br/><br/>Fortunately, Arselon was able to dispatch the Wraith in three rounds.  After round 2, the undead creature was down to 1HP, and went for Nunk to heal up on his life force.  Andromeda flung herself in the way and (success) used Bone Dust in an impromptu ritual to divert the Wraith's attention.  The Wraith was confused long enough for Arselon to slice off that final HP.<br/><br/>Everyone at the table breathed a sigh of relief.  Wraiths were scary!<br/><br/><b>Next: </b>Skitterlings, lightning guns, and how things can so quickly go pear-shaped in combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397491/#Comment_397491" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T11:31:07+00:00" title="November 14, 2012 11:31AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent!

Now, I've found a number of monster encounters happen not because I've preplanned it, but because someone in the group failed a roll, drawing a hard move on my part.  I realize now how often I've used "alert the nearest critter" as my move.<br/><br/>I've been mixing up the kind of opponent I throw at the party.  Last time it was the Wraith.  So far, everything they've done on the DG side has been melee-focused.  This session, I created relatively weak things that had significant missile capability: <i>Skitterlings</i>, quasi-demonic servitors of the cult, armed with lightning guns (1d6+1 damage, metal armor doesn't protect), frost grenades (no damage, but slowed or immobilized unless a full CON success is obtained), and a couple also carried chain-net guns (immobilize target on a failed DEX roll).  Almost no ability to stand up in melee, but able to blast away from a distance.  Skitterlings are child-sized, and look like featherless albino crows wrapped in voluminous ragged black cloaks that hide their gear.  I notched up about a dozen of them and marked the map with the location of their main patrol, alerted by fleeing cultists.<br/><br/>The Ranger chose to scout ahead at a corridor crossroads, heading left to find the corridor with the cells around a corner, and noting three Skitterlings standing guard.  She withdrew (success) without being seen, and reported to the party.  They decided to have her scout the right-hand corridor.<br/><br/>Torches were a real addition to atmosphere and tactical considerations.  I used the guidelines from the BWHQ thread for torches, torch stubs, and candles, and that seemed to work really well.  Several kids commented on how much they liked the idea of having to conserve their resources or be left in the dark.<br/><br/>And as an odd quirk of personality married to character class, EM as the Druid exclaimed that she was tired of being underground in the dark and wanted to go fight a monster outside, "like in the woods or a mountaintop."<br/><br/>More later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell%20Hoyle" title="Russell Hoyle"><img alt="Russell Hoyle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell%20Hoyle">Russell Hoyle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397885/#Comment_397885" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T17:13:03+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  5:13PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't find the thread you're talking about on BWHQ. can you give me a pointer in the right direction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397895/#Comment_397895" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T17:39:15+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  5:39PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2012 5:40PM by UserClone.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's strange, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/396797" rel="nofollow">you posted in it</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rusty" title="Rusty"><img alt="Rusty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rusty">Rusty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397910/#Comment_397910" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T18:49:50+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  6:49PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doh!

Arian the Ranger spotted them first and withdrew<i> (success)</i> without being seen.  The party decided to lie in ambush.  When I asked what they were going to do about their flickering torch, they decided to fling the torch across the corridor into the branch directly across from them.  They readied their weapons and <i>(success for everyone)</i> hunkered back in the dark, waiting for the enemy to come and investigate the torch.<br/><br/>There was a lot of social churn during the strategizing over this encounter.  Focus seemed hard to get.  EM was busy drawing a picture of Niff for F, A and G were conversing in the middle of their scene, and no one seemed clear on what to do.  J, L's dad, was trying to offer some tactical advice without being overbearing, and F had an idea of what he wanted them to try, but in general, it was a bit chaotic.  Finally, they were able to agree on a rough plan, throw the torch, and hide.  It wasn't a brilliant plan, but under the circumstances, probably the best they could do.  What sealed it was the universally successful stealth effort.  When the shadowy Skitterlings came around the corner, they hit the torch with a freeze globe and put out the light, but the globes themselves put out a dim light under the cloaks, so there was fragmentary illumination to help guide the combat.<br/><br/>Niff launched himself at them and <i>(success) </i>cut one down across the corridor.  Arian followed him, calling on her flaming spear for the third and final time that day, and speared one while her lion mauled another.  A fourth Skitterling deployed the chain-net gun, but Niff hit him before it could be fired.  Unfortunately <i>(partial success)</i>, the chain net went off and blocked the corridor at the intersection, separating Niff from the rest of the party.<br/><br/>The rest of the Skitterlings were coming up with lightning guns at the ready.  I don't recall all the details, but essentially, Arian slew a couple more with her spear, as did the lion before it was<i> (partial success)</i> grazed by a frost globe and partly frozen.  Lucius the Cleric leaped in and struck down a couple more.  There'd been an attempt by Lucius and Sklarah to soak a blanket in fire oil and ignite it, and this provided some light and warmth against the frost globe effects, but didn't do any damage to Skitterlings.  At one point amid the chaos, someone's crit meant they killed a foe and another Skitterling accidently blasted one of its own.  Odds were beginning to swing in favor of the party.<br/><br/>But it would prove to be premature to celebrate. Valavanora got off a shot with her bow, but<i> (failure)</i> missed, and was hit by (die of Fate 1) <i>two</i> lightning attacks that catapulted her back a dozen feet and knocked her to -2HP, dying.  Tension ratcheted up as Sklarah--not wanting to risk using quicksilver since she was still beyond her limit--charged and <i>(partial success)</i> cut down a Skitterling, but was unable to reach the others before the next round.  Niff<i> (success)</i> picked off a Skitterling with his bow, shooting through the net.<br/><br/>The next round had the Skitterlings blasting away with lightning, and pretty much everyone but Niff went down with partial successes in avoiding damage.  This is where Conditions made a huge difference.  We were left with Arian <i>Dazed</i>, Sklarah <i>Out</i>, and Lucius <i>Knocked Down</i>.  The Lion was <i>Very Slowed</i> from the frost globe, half-frozen.  Everyone was low on HP.  Niff was <i>(failure) </i>unable to tear the chain-net free, and the remaining Skitterlings were far enough down the corridor from the intersection that they weren't viable targets.  The last shot by Arian had killed the third-to-last Skitterling, but two were still up and leveling their guns at Lucius and Arian for the coup de grace.  Valavanora was dying or dead, Sklarah unconscious.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nunk was busy clearing the rubble out of the rockfall, and G and A were frantic with the realization that their little subplot twist might have doomed the others.  Their characters would arrive too late to enter the fray.<br/><br/>It was at that point when M asked who was able to do anything, and I had her roll for the Lion to make a Heroic Effort.  If it had failed, it would have been One Hurt Lion, which I'm sure would have made everyone sad, especially M.  But the Lion <i>(success) </i>managed to leap on one of the Skitterlings and kill it.  And EM realized her Peregrine Falcon Pet, Dera, was still functional, so we had her roll for the falcon, and she rolled a clean success.  The falcon distracted the Skitterling enough for the Lion to get another attack, which it successfully pulled off.  As Arian shook off her Dazed state and Lucius wearily climbed to his feet, the battle was over.<br/><br/>Immediately, everyone raced to Valavanora's side.  For some reason, no one thought about healing potions.  I think they still had some stashed away, but no one has been super detailed in tracking their stuff, so maybe not.  Or maybe Valavanora had charge of them, and no one thought to go through her belongings.  In any case, it was clear she was dying or dead.  Lucius attempted to Cure her wounds, but <i>(failure)</i> the God refused to heal a "woodland heathen."  Undeterred, he tried his Heal skill and rolled a success, stabilizing her.<br/><br/>I asked EM to roll for Valavanora to defy death, per John's suggestion above.  I'd already narrated the atmospheric spiritual image of her standing before Death's Great Door in the Barren Forest of Mists, death's pale visage and bone white stag horns.

EM thought both of those options would be cool, and seemed fine with her druid dying.  All in all, her reaction was really stellar, and more grounded and positive than many adults I've played with (and me too on a few occasions in the thankfully distant past).<br/><br/>Still, I reiterated that character death was only an option if voluntary, and Valavanora could opt to come back changed in some fundamental way from her brush with Death.  They liked the idea of Death asking for Valavanora to fulfill some task, and I suggested her hair might have turned white from the experience.  Everyone <i>loved</i> that idea, and M leaned forward and exclaimed to EM, "Do you realize how much <i>depth</i> you've just gotten from this?"  What was so terrific about this entire interaction was the positive, supportive aspect to it all.  The girls (and F, though he'd had to leave early and wasn't there for this bit) really impress me as a great group of players.  I wish I'd had this sort of group when I'd started back in the White Box era.<br/><br/>EM decided Valavanora would live, her hair white (but only on the front, like X-Men's Rogue, as JM pointed out that her thief Mist already had white hair).  We're also still talking over the deeper change to personality and maybe some kind of death resonance in her Druidic magic. She's pretty excited about the potential story to be had, and she's talking about Valavanora's background and homeland, which is a win, as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>A, playing the Necromancer, is thrilled at the potential for the two players to collaborate.  Their imaginative play together outside of gaming features a lot of Necromancy lately.  I expect a bunch of creative energy from the two of them on this piece.<br/><br/>So...stabilized by the skillful minstrations of Lucius, Valavanora returns to Life with 1HP.  We'll see later if Lucius's god will punish him for intervening where the god had refused to do so.<br/><br/>All in all, everyone seemed pretty happy.  We're taking a break over Thanksgiving weekend, to the disappointment of everyone, but I think it'll be good to have a bye, if only so I can focus on Nanowrimo and put down some more thoughtful notes about the world and an umbrella quest for them.  I have a feeling that once out of the dungeon, the group will be ready for more story-focused adventuring.  By that I mean less in the way of old school set-pieces and more opportunities to roleplay and solve mysteries, etc.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> Thoughts on house rules and encumbrance, and my partial success therein.</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398166/#Comment_398166" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T02:12:43+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  2:12AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy cats that's good stuff.

We (EM and I) are noodling over how she wants the Death Aspect to manifest.  She likes the idea of a personality effect, giving her the opportunity to do some pre-teen dramatic brooding.  I've suggested an Autumnal resonance to her magic, like dried leaves appearing in her long hair, maybe colored by circumstance (blood red in combat, yellow when she's nervous, and so on).  I am also thinking the Aspect manifests by allowing her to summon spirits normally inaccessible to Druids, not full-on Necromancy, but Death-Aspected Nature Spirits, like the ghosts of wolves, a Dead Wind, or a Winter Gloom--Winter and Autumn would feature strongly here.<br/><br/>I've been playing that Necromancers get a +1 when dealing with spirits related to Death generally, but they can only summon those spirits.  Inspired heavily by Garth Nix's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sabriel</span> books (which feature one of the neatest, most evocative magic system evar), A has talked about peering past the veil of Death, etc.  The Druid shouldn't step on the Necromancer's toes, but this Aspect may give her more power over those darker and forgotten aspects of Nature.  At the same time, she could have a harder time using Spring and Summer Aspected magic.  And I'm thinking maybe her falcon familiar now has a snow-white feather marking its brow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398193/#Comment_398193" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T09:43:48+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  9:43AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2012 11:45AM by Hexabolic.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, house rules...mixed success here.  Conditions worked really well, and the girls (and F) grokked them immediately.  Their only complaint was that they wanted more conditions on the character sheet, and suggested a bunch I had considered but hadn't put down, stuff that in retrospect is obvious, like <i>Dazed</i>.   JM later commented with the Dungeon Kids that she wanted Drunk as a Condition (having read a LOT of Tintin and Asterix, she thinks her characters being drunk would be funny).  I am not putting Drunk as a Condition for these kids groups, though.  Call me old-fashioned, but I'm mindful of the age-appropriate aspect here and parental sensibilities.  I did rework the sheets for the Dungeon Kids to add a bunch of blank Conditions to be filled out in play.<br/><br/><b>LIGHT</b><br/>Illumination was easy.  I started with the idea that a torch provided light for three people, or a circle with a three-person diameter.  Beyond that, light was ((dim)) for another three-person distance, giving a -1 penalty to perception.  Beyond that, it was ((shadowy)) for a -3.  Beyond that it was ((dark)) for -5, if you even got to roll at all.  Different light sources had different distances.  A candle gave light for one person, a lantern for five.  A bullseye lantern projected in one direction only in a cone five persons long.  A candle stub provided light only for examination of something up close.  A torch stub worked like a candle.  I assigned durations to each light source as well, using "turns" as an abstract, flexible unit of time.<br/><br/>The girls took to these rules quickly, so there wasn't a problem.<br/><br/>For rations, I just played that by telling them now and then they had to consume a ration or become <i>Hungry</i>.  Ditto with water, which I'm tracking separately along with the <i>Thirsty</i> condition because they're in a desert realm. <br/><br/>Encumbrance-wise, I overbaked the rules and ended up Beta-testing them on the girls, which wasn't the best idea.  I'd asked about it ahead of time, and the girls seemed happy to have more structure in organizing their stuff.  What I came up with, in tandem with adding Conditions and Illumination rules, was just too confusing and overwhelming.<br/><br/><b>ENCUMBRANCE</b><br/>Taking inspiration from the BW thread, I started with the idea of a "thing" as the basic unit of "stuff" and "slot" as the basic unit of space.<br/><br/>One thing takes up one slot unless ((tags)) change the relationship.  So basically, you can add ((tags)) to either things or slots to change their space or add Condition-like aspects.  The ((long)) tag, for example, basically means you can't carry it in an interior slot of a pack, bag, or satchel, but you can carry it in something ((large)) or ((unlimited)).  The latter, incidentally, applies to the Satchel of Holding the Druid carries.  The ((bundle)) tag means you can pack X units of the item as one "thing," so rations ((bundle 7)) would mean seven uses of your rations take up one slot.  <i>Coin</i> would be too, but I pretty much just said a thousand silvers equal 1 thing and left it at that.<br/><br/><b>Examples of Thing Tags: </b>((large)) ((small)) ((long)) ((bulky)) ((bundle X)) ((compact)) ((soft)) ((heavy)) ((fragile))<br/><br/><b>Examples of Slot Tags: </b>((spacious)) ((hard)) ((cramped)) ((stretchy)) ((outside)) ((unlimited)) ((secure)) ((large)) ((scabbard))<br/><br/>I went with each character having three torso slots and a Belt slot.  A Pack has six slots and takes two Torso slots, Armor takes one Torso slot, a Satchel has two slots and takes one Torso slot.  A Belt has two ((scabbard)) slots and can hold 10 ((small)) items in pouches.<br/><br/>Then for Encumbrance, I started with the idea that each character can carry Things equal to 5+STR+CON without being encumbered...anyway, here it is.<br/><br/><i>LESS THAN/equal to RATING = NO PROBLEM!<br/>MORE THAN ENC = 1 STEP SLOWER<br/>MORE THAN ENC +3 = 2 STEPS SLOWER +TIRED<br/>MORE THAN 2X ENC = VERY SLOW +HUNGRY</i><br/><br/>As I said, it was too much and too fiddly, requiring lots of attention to tagging damn near everything in the game.  M, who is  an enthusiastic, attentive player and totally candid, commented that she found the encumbrance rules confusing, so I pretty much dropped them on the spot.<br/><br/>For the Dungeon Kids, I reworked the sheet to simply say, <i>here's how much space you have to carry your stuff.</i>  The rules are: (1) if you can write it in there, you have room (this is a real limitation for third graders, I have to point out); and (2) if a thing obviously wouldn't fit in a space--like a spear in a satchel--you can't keep it there; (3) outside slots can hold those long, awkward things; (4) if you're carrying a ton of stuff, you will be one or two steps slower, and you might get Tired and Hungry.<i><br/><br/><b>NEXT:</b> Dungeon Kids and the Huge, Incredibly Scary Bugbear.</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398214/#Comment_398214" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T12:41:50+00:00" title="November 20, 2012 12:41PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, onto Dungeon Kids.<br/><br/>We had C playing Romrama the Imperial Dwarf, JM taking the roles of Mist the Thief and Amber the Wizard, and S playing Lostariel the Assassin and Rhavaniel the Ranger.  I'd confirmed with C's mom that C was coming, and she said he's been bouncing with excitement about the game, so that was reassuring.  Also, when C failed to show a couple of sessions back, JM experienced a "big feeling" that involved tears and a face session with the living room couch pillow.  I was happy not to have to deal with that.<br/><br/>However, C arrived about a half hour late, and the kids were revved up with excitement.  Basic management took a lot more effort this time around, and I had to pull out a bit of the Dad energy to get the S to sit up rather than lie on the bench, and to ask JM not to interrupt the other two players constantly with entertaining but totally off-point observations.  I finally had to step back and ask if they wanted to go do something else for a bit or play the game.<br/><br/>"Play the game!" they said.<br/><br/>OK, good.  We proceeded.  Looking back on it, I am considering using Awesome Points more aggressively, in the way <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faery's Tale</span> suggests for Essence: as a reward encouraging good kid player behavior.  It's basic self-preservation; if I have to expend so much energy on kid management, it'll suck a bunch of it away from the game while making it less fun for me.  They need to pay enough attention to engage respectfully and interact with the fiction at the table.  At the same time, they're third graders.  There's only so far I can take my behavioral expectations before they become unrealistic.  I'm betting  some social defrag time at the start of the next DK session will help them settle down, plus a couple of planned breaks to let them get their ya-yas out periodically.  It's a really different energy and pace from the Dungeon Girls group.<br/><br/>Last session, they'd destroyed a goblin patrol led by an Orc Captain and accompanied by an Orc Drummer and Orc Shaman.  We'd ended with EM's cliffhanger moment of her Wizard fainting from excessive quicksilver use, and then being kidnapped by the Orc Shaman's darkness spider spirit.  This session, the party was setting out to rescue their captive friend.<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>Deeper into the Citadel of Evil.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398224/#Comment_398224" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-20T14:09:23+00:00" title="November 20, 2012  2:09PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2012 2:09PM by Hexabolic.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

I'd also handed out the upgrade character sheets with the conditions.  It was a bit much to start third graders with, but they handled it well.  Would have been a lot easier if JM and S weren't playing two characters each.  C wanted to make another character, but I encouraged him to stick with Romrama for the moment.<br/><br/>The party gathered themselves and entered the next room, which was the room where the goblin patrol had barracked.  I described a messy area with scattered blankets and half-eaten, flyblown food, a barrel of brackish water, and a table laden with more mess.  Under the table lay a sleeping goblin with a jug in one hand.<br/><br/>"What do you d--" I began, but C shouted, "I run over and hit him with my axe!"  Almost immediately, S said her Assassin was running over to stab the goblin with her knife.<br/><br/>"Umm, really?" I asked.  "He's asleep..."<br/><br/>They would not be deterred.  I had to think hard for a moment about whether I was going to engage in any normative guidance here.  I decided to let things play out as the kids drove it, but to introduce some small, related consequence down the road that might give them pause the next time they encounter a helpless victim.  Certainly their current body count was nothing to sneeze at, so maybe I needed to let go of squeamishness and embrace the OSR ethos.  But on the other hand, I felt  discomfort at what encouraging what appeared to be classic murderhobo behavior.<br/><br/>Anyway, Romrama and Lostariel hacked and stabbed the Bejesus out of the poor little bugger, and JM described her hardass Thief Mist coming over and kicking the corpse.  I could see JM wasn't feeling kosher about this particular killing.  JM told me later, "It didn't feel right.  It didn't feel right to just go over and stab him in the heart."  He wasn't doing anything and couldn't fight back.<br/><br/>Mist kicked the body, JM says, "because she didn't want the others to know Mist felt a soft spot for the goblin."  That statement fit right in line with my observation.  JM says Mist didn't try to stop them because she was lost in thought, thinking about Amber, and because the other two characters just ran over there really fast.  She thinks they could have gotten some information out of him if they hadn't been so quick with the killin'.<br/><br/>They didn't find more than a handful of silvers in the room, so they quickly vacated it.  The next room contained a staircase to the next level.

The write-ups were pretty light, a short paragraph per room, and I'd been populating pretty much off the cuff, taking inspiration from the text where it struck my fancy.  The goblins and the orcs were entirely my own invention, for instance.  But the upcoming level--and one of the neat things here is that they're working their way <i>up</i> to the citadel from the caverns below--described cells for prisoners, a guardroom with guards, and a shrine room where a sacrifice was taking place.  So I determined that Amber had been taken to be a sacrifice.  The Orc Shaman wanted to summon another, more powerful spirit to take out the party, since Amber's lightning spirit had burned right through his darkness spider.  He was using a sacrifice because he didn't have enough quicksilver to call this thing (maybe uber-powerful spirits take multiple quicksilver doses, or failure on a dose is catastrophic).  I also decided the guards were on alert.<br/><br/>The guardroom described two hobgoblins and a bugbear captain, so it made sense to beef these guys up a bit.  I gave the hobs 1 Armor, 10HP, 1d6+1 damage, and Keen Senses.  The Bugbear ended up with 2 Armor + a Shield for a total of 3 Armor, 20HP, 2d6 damage, and Fearless.  I thought we might see a pitched battle in the narrow corridor, and the real question was whether the party could save Amber from being sacrificed.  If Amber was in jeopardy, we'd still apply the voluntary death rule, but there would be consequences.  I was pretty sure JM would be OK with that.<br/><br/>Stealth rolls failed as Romrama came into the hallway from the stairwell.  One of the hobgoblins stationed at the other end of the corridor on the far side of the cells spied him and sounded the alarm.  The party charged!  Mist drew her elven Sword of Tirendel, which flashed blue for the goblinoid presence.  She rolled for the sword's Cause Fear to Orc-kin skill, but though the hobgoblins were indeed afraid, they <i>(failure)</i> were able to brace themselves to fight.  Their fear made them hesitant (-1 damage and would not pursue aggressive tactics).  Mist and Romrama <i>(both successes)</i> took down the first one almost immediately, without harm to themselves.  Lostariel the Assassin and Rhavaniel the Ranger <i>(both succeesses)</i> hurled daggers into the second one that caused him to stagger back from the pain of his wounds.  So far, so good.  Mist <i>(partial success)</i> dispatched the second one with a thrust of her elven sword at the top of the next round, but not before Romrama took a blow that forced him back a step.  His armor, shield, and Tough ability kept him safe from damage.<br/><br/>He actually is a really tough sucker, this Imperial Dwarf.  Four points of Armor is nothing to sneeze at, which was good because he was still first level.<br/><br/>Before the second hob died, Lostariel failed her attack, and S said she wanted the Assassin to be taken just like Amber, so I shrugged and described the darkness spider reaching down from the ceiling and snatching up Lostariel.  Another sacrifice for the mill.<br/><br/>Then the Bugbear stepped up in his lacquered armor, his scarred wooden shield, and his mace.  I pulled out the narrative mojo with him, detailing his size, hairy ferocity, fangs, and most especially that heavy iron mace with its head cast in the shape of a snarling wolf's head.  The kids' eyes got big as I pantomimed the Bugbear advancing, mace striking sparks from the stone wall and play-roared, "RRAHHR!"<br/><br/>"What does Mist do?" I asked JM, since she had the high DEX and was first up.  "He doesn't seem affected by the sight of your sword."<br/><br/>"I...I parry the mace with my sword," she said.  "And try to get out of the way.  I'll, uh, I'll duck down low and roll between his legs."<br/><br/>Romrama?  C replied, "I turn and run.  I'm going back to the stairs!"<br/><br/>Rhavaniel?  "I also back away, ready to run."<br/><br/>Resolution.  Romrama <i>(partial success)</i> successfully flees, but the sweeping blow of the Bugbear's deadly mace strikes the dwarf's trusty axe from his hand!  Mist <i>(critical) </i>deflects the mace away from her as she rolls under the Bugbear and comes up behind him.  For her crit special effect?  "I hit him with my sword in the butt as I pass under him!"  She deals 4HP damage after armor.  In the Bugbear butt.  JM chortles at this, it being right in line with high third grade humor.  Had the Bugbear farted, we'd have had to take five due to hilarity.<br/><br/>This swashbuckling strike <i>(Die of FATE low)</i> totally enrages the Bugbear, igniting a berserker fury.  He wheels on Mist, spit spraying from his mouth as he shrieks in fury and brings his Mace down in a mighty overhand strike!<br/><br/>Mist <i>(success)</i> leaps back from him and takes off down the corridor (the opposite direction from Romrama and Rhavaniel.  At this juncture, I was a bit surprised that this group was running like this.  Fortunately for her, Mist had, at the beginning of the session, given her light armor to Romrama, who <i>(partial success)</i> managed to modify the armor to fit him well enough to use.  So she is as fleet as can be with Athletics and a +3 DEX.  She easily outpaces the crazed Bugbear.<br/><br/>Down that corridor is the iron double door to the shrine and sacrifice.  I entertain the vision of an epic confrontation with cultists, Orc Shaman, raging Bugbear, and Mist alone for a round or two.  But she bolts right past that door to the end of the hall, which is sealed by a closed door.  A locked one, as the Die of Fate would have it.<br/><br/>Mist frantically tries to jimmy the lock while the Bugbear crashes down the corridor toward her, and she <i>(success) </i>manages just in time to slip through and start up the wooden stairwell on the other side.  Below her, the Bugbear squeezes through the doorway and roars at her before continuing its pursuit.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Romrama and Rhavaniel have gathered their courage and are racing after the Bugbear to help their friend.  Will they be in time?<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> Final throwdown with the Bugbear of Doom and Ritual Interruptus.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398357/#Comment_398357" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T16:02:03+00:00" title="November 21, 2012  4:02PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Sidenote: </b>I was surprised the characters ran from the Bugbear.

I continue to be astonished at the enthusiastic reception here, as well as from the kids.<br/><br/>Mist runs up the stairwell, frothing Bugbear in pursuit.  After four flights of stairs, she <i>(failure on a CON roll)</i> becomes Winded, unable to run further or even attack for a round as she catches her breath.  While Romrama and Rhavaniel labor to catch up, the Bugbear, also panting from the exertion, screams and charges, swinging its mace at Mist's head.  Mist (partial success) dodges the mace, but fails to evade the Bugbear's rush.  His shield slams her over the rail for a four story fall!<br/><br/>However, agile Mist drops her elven sword and <i>(Athletics crit) </i>grabs the rail to vault around and kick the Bugbear "right in the eyes, Daddy! With my heels!"  Blinded, the Bugbear roars and flails wildly with mace and shield.  Romrama arrives to<i> (success)</i> slam his axe deep into the monster's knee while Rhavaniel <i>(crit)</i> jams her magical hunting spear through the creature's brisket!  As they wrench their weapons free, the mortally wounded Bugbear groans and staggers, then topples over the rail to land with a huge thump at the base of the stairwell, where it lies still.<br/><br/>Mist finishes catching her breath, while the relieved players woo-hoo and exchange high-fives.  Ever the practical one, Rhavaniel immediately suggests looting the monster's corpse.  This they do and find a few semi-precious jewels.  The mace, though cool and attractive, turns out to be heavier than anyone wants to carry.  They leave it behind and proceed to check out the mysterious double doors they'd passed during the pursuit.<br/><br/>Do they arrive in time to stop the ritual?  Die of Fate says...<i>4</i>, which I interpret as being "sort of yes."  They come down and Mist listens.  She hears chanting.  Shedding any pretense at caution, Mist kicks the doors open (they were unlocked) and charges the line of four cultists she finds standing between her and the Orc Shaman, who is about to lower Amber into a mysterious pit set between two braziers burning with green flames.  Romrama follows on her heels and sees the chain binding Amber leads to a crank off to the right manned by a fifth cultist.  A sixth cultist stands guard over a couple of other prisoners, including the captive Lostariel.  Everything is in place for a set-piece climax.<br/><br/>Or, as events unfolded, an anti-climax.  Mist <i>(success)</i> slams her way through the cultists and leaps for the Orc Shaman, her elven sword held high.  The Shaman<i> (success for the sword's Cause Fear in Orcs and Goblin-kin skill)</i> quails in fear of the eldritch blade as he frantically tries to pull out a magical fetish to call a spirit to his defense.<br/><br/>Romrama <i>(partial success) </i>hacks down the cultist, but his blow carries through and cuts the chain, dropping Amber into the pit as the chain rattles off the spool.  Rhavaniel <i>(success)</i> throws her spear into the cultist guarding S's other character, but he doesn't go down immediately, hanging onto life with 1HP as well as her transfixing magical spear.<br/><br/>The next round, Mist kebabs the Orc Shaman with a crit that does ridiculous damage.  JM demonstrates for us how quick the sword thrust is: "in and out *wssht* and he's SO dead."  After the murderhobo killing of the sleeping goblin, this feels clean and surgical in comparison.<br/><br/>Romrama drops his shield and axe and <i>(success)</i> grabs the chain as it leaves the crank spool, arresting Amber's fall.  But now there are four cultists remaining.  Two go for Romrama and two for Rhavaniel.  Rhavaniel <i>(success) </i>takes one down with a thrown dagger, then runs over to grab Lostariel's staff, which is propped against the wall.  Romrama <i>(partial success)</i> whips the chain he's holding around the first cultist's neck, but suffers a ferocious dagger slash from the other one, who rolls maximum success for 6 points!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mist drops her elven sword and catches Amber, pulling her free of the pit.<br/><br/>Remember how Romrama is a tough bugger, even at first level?  He doesn't have his shield, but his Armor 1 and Toughness drop that damage by half, and he has 7HP, so even though the dagger cuts him painfully, he survives.  The next round, he  draws his own dagger and <i>(success) </i>stabs the cultist in the heart.  With a +2 STR, he can deal out a heavy blow.<br/><br/>Rhavaniel <i>(crit)</i> beats the last cultist down with a whirling staff move, and it's all over but the XP awards and loot.  However, we only handle the first, since the kids are totally wound up.  Mist is encroaching on 4th level, but Romrama reached 2nd, to general jubilation.<br/><br/>This session saw a ton of Awesome Point use, and the kids were eager to use them to help one another.  I started asking them how they could rationalize helping their friend.  Was it a memory of a conversation (i.e., a flashback)?  Do you give them a knowing look or a hand signal?  Toss them a weapon?  That helped them get a bit of a feel for how their characters interacted.  But their unstinting generosity was touching.  There was no hesitation, and they depleted their stores helping boost a roll all the way from, say, a partial at 7 to a full success at 10.  Really cool teamwork, and I suggested they could get Awesome Points if they worked as a team.  But they couldn't take off in the middle of a melee to make a plan.  Plans had to be made when their <i>characters</i> had time to talk.  They seemed cool with this limitation, and I released them to play until the moms arrived.<br/><br/>As a final note, my wife, an elementary school teacher at the school attended by all the kids and girls except for EM and A, told me last night she had another DK player.  A boy, J, whom she described as nice, <i>really</i> smart, gentle, a bit squirrelly, a fan of fantasy, and a newcomer to the school who has had a hard time making friends.  I don't recall how it came up, but she heard he loved fantasy and played WoW, so she asked if he'd be interested in Dungeon Kids.<br/><br/>"Is it a computer game?" he asked.  No, she responded.  It's a tabletop game with pencils and dice.<br/><br/>"Oh.  I've always wanted to play in a game like that," he said in a small voice.  "Is it the kind of game that goes for awhile and then stops?"<br/><br/>Well, she said, it's the kind of game that can go on for months or years.  It lasts as long as your imagination lets it.<br/><br/>"That sounds perfect," he said.  "If I could play in a game like that, I think I'd be an Elf."<br/><br/>His mom is onboard, so it looks like the Dungeon Kids have a fourth.

Looking back on it, I definitely got caught up in overdesigning, making things granular beyond the simple framework of WoD.  We didn't use the Illumination rules since this dungeon part was inhabited and featured plenty of torchlight.<br/><br/>I was thinking about adapting the pack rules from the Story Realms game I playtested with JM a couple of months ago, where there are different kinds of packs from which you roll to pull out the stuff you need, maybe with a checkbox system of some kind to represent capacity.  But for now, forget it.  The Dungeon Girls love shopping anyway, so I don't want to take away any of their opportunity to spend their hard-won silvers on all sorts of widgets, pets, and extra gear.<br/><br/>With four kids, I am considering going down to one character each.  The problem here is that I really like both of JM's characters, Amber and Mist.  And as JM pointed out, Amber is the only magic user in the party, but Mist is the only one who can Heal.

Just tell them that now that you have so many players it's not necessary or desirable to have so many characters, but that perhaps some characters are so fun to have around or the players enjoy playing them that they should be kept, regardless. Complain that too many characters makes for extra work for the GM, too. And of course the extra characters can be kept as a reserve - players can switch between them between adventures or in case of fatalities, so it's not like they disappear altogether. Then let the group decide who, if any, are going to continue playing two characters. Perhaps they'll decide that everybody except JM really would rather just play one character. If they decide that everybody should have two, then tough break, streamline your methodology to handle the workload, and perhaps you might complain about it some more later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398397/#Comment_398397" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-21T22:58:46+00:00" title="November 21, 2012 10:58PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, sound advice.  I'm not worried about my extra work, but the extra effort for them does distract them at the table, primarily from tracking their stuff and XP, and staying on top of their different characters in play.  JM is pretty good at juggling her two and keeping them distinct, but it's challenging for her as well.  I like the idea of their having a roster to pick from.  We'll have an opportunity to talk about this at the next game.  If they all want two characters, that's not a bad thing, as you've pointed out.  They'll have to be more organized.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398436/#Comment_398436" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-22T09:52:25+00:00" title="November 22, 2012  9:52AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2012 10:15AM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to say that I've been greatly enjoying the thread.<br/><br/>Regarding J, didn't you mention that the cultists had a couple of other prisoners? Could one of them be J's elf?<br/><br/>Regarding JM's double characters, the happiest coincidence would be if J wanted a character that could fill one of those niches (either a magic user or a healer). If not and JM would prefer to retire Amber, then is a magic user really mandatory for the party? You can just dial down the magical threat for the next adventure. If JM would prefer to retire Mist, then I guess you really do need a healer, what you could do is have Mist imbue her healing ability into some kind of token (perhaps a necklace) and leave it with one of the other characters so they have Mist's healing power (only) plus whatever they were already bringing to the party.<br/><br/>Regarding writing out the double characters in general, yeah, you can level with them about the logistics and that going down to one character will make it a better game, but to sell it to them I would look at hooking it into the fiction. Show them a fictional path where they 'retire' one character which they'll think is really cool. Some examples off the top of my head: they a message from one of their family requiring their attendance for some crisis; they receive a vision from their deity and are drawn to undertake a solo pilgrimage of some kind to gain new insight; their order/guild requires them to undertake an assignment of some kind or take additional instruction under the tutelage of one of their masters.<br/><br/>Sell it to them as something that'll give those characters extra depth. Sell sending one of their characters off on a personal quest as a privilege for being one of the founding 'Dungeon Kids'.<br/><br/>And then whatever it is you can then hook into future adventures - and hinting they may get an extra cool power (from their pilgrimage/tutelage/family) when that character returns. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398450/#Comment_398450" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-22T11:46:15+00:00" title="November 22, 2012 11:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, much appreciated.<br/><br/>We're thinking along the same lines about J's character being a prisoner.  Way cool!<br/><br/>Yeah, the double character issue may best resolve by rotating characters out in some way, and I like the idea of making the rotation awesome.<br/><br/>My dilemma as far as JM goes is that I am a fan of both characters.  Mist is a badass from the word 'go,' but Amber has taken on awesome story depth already.  Part of that comes from the spirit-based magic system, of which I am growing more fond of every time I run the game.  The choices of spirit domains and appearance add a huge dose of personality, and Amber has given the Goddess of the Moon, Travelers, and Hope her life, so she has the option to multiclass at the next level.  I'm really excited by that possibility, plus spirits are incredibly fun to narrate.  The sensawunda element they bring is high, much more flavorful IMHO than conventional fantasy spellcasting.  Anyway, a rotation may be the best solution here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400268/#Comment_400268" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T21:47:13+00:00" title="December  9, 2012  9:47PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2012 10:55PM by Hexabolic.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we've had a session each of Dungeon Kids and Dungeon Girls.  I've some catching up to do.  Dungeon Kids this last week turned out to be owned by the wizard, whereas Dungeon Girls finally saw the party leaving the dungeon and re-entering the world.<br/><br/>I'll start with Dungeon Kids.  C didn't show as his Mom forgot the date, and the girls didn't want to play unless he or the new boy J showed.  Fortunately, J arrived with his dad, and after Junior Moppet and S gave him the tour of the house and played a little, we got down to business.  The dad stuck around to watch, since he lived a good fifteen miles away and didn't have anything else to do that afternoon.  I suspect he wanted to check things out since he didn't know me from Adam, even if my wife is one of his kid's teachers.  But he was cool, and clearly enjoyed watching his son in action.<br/><br/>J decided to be an Elf Archer named <i>Ingor</i>.  He went with Athletics as a Class Skill, picked Stealth as his second, and from the Special Abilities Scout, Cantrip, Volley, and Skirmish, he went with Cantrip and Volley for his Lvl 1 package.  For gear, he bought a dagger, a bow, some rations, and some torches.  Simple.<br/><br/>We started him off as a prisoner of the cultists freed after the battle in the sacrifice room.  The game opens as the characters loot the dead cultists and find a chest.  Mist opens the lock, and inside they discover a coffer and a couple of sacks.<br/><br/>I'd found <a href="http://www.myth-weavers.com/generate_treasure.php?do=treasure" rel="nofollow">this site</a> for help in generating treasure, and compiled a short list beforehand.  (The results for potions, by the way, are pretty cool, since they include taste and color/viscosity as part of the random output.)<br/><br/>Nothing terribly uber-awesome is in the treasure, and the girls let Ingor have the 25 gold coins (500 silver) because they feel he didn't have anything yet.  There are a few potions as well as a ring of Resist Cold that Ingor also gets to keep.  They decide to keep the Bugbear's scary wolfhead mace, which I'd determined was magical, but cursed: you have to roll a Con roll every day you carried it because it was just that heavy and tiring to pack around.  Failure means you're whupped at -1 against your physical rolls until you can rest for a few hours and recover.  Ingor is <i>(success)</i> vigorous enough to withstand the strain of the mace (for now)&gt;.  Mist considers taking it, but decides it's too heavy for her swashbuckling fighting style.<br/><br/>After they finish dividing up the loot, the group heads out to explore the rest of the dungeon.  Rather than take the stairs where they'd fought the bugbear last time, they go down a second tunnel that ends in a tall, massive iron door.  I describe the door as bearing a snarling face cast into the metal.  According to the thumbnail description in the mini-dungeon text, the door was mage-locked with a simple code to open it (say "NEPO").  Amber the Wizard calls upon her Lore and <i>(partial success) </i>remembers these doors often use simple codes like reverse words and so forth.  I expected them to try some words and maybe decide to take the other way up via the stairs.  However, the group didn't want to waste time guessing.<br/><br/>Amber summons her night/cold spirit, <i>The Book of Ice</i>, and tells it to freeze that door!  The Book, having appeared and opened to the page displaying its "How shall I serve you, Mistress?" greeting, proceeds to freeze hell out of the door.  Amber rolls for effect and gets an 11.  A thick layer of frost rimes the door as the spirit wraps it in supernatural chill so intense it causes the iron to creak.  Then Ingor smashes the wolf-head mace into the door and <i>(crit)</i> smites the damned thing asunder!  Shaking my head, I narrate how the frozen, brittle iron is broken apart enough for them to slip through it, but the shattering of the door also makes a huge racket.  I am quite impressed at their strategy here, and proud of the use of Science! to solve the problem.  Scratch one magic door.<br/><br/>And this is going to be a problem, because the door opens onto a mountain path that leads around a curve and up a short distance to a citadel straddling the path.  The hobgoblin garrison there, already alerted to the presence of deadly adventurers, is now aware that someone is coming.  And they are ready.<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>A desperate scramble on the mountain path and...attack of the Frost Worm!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400274/#Comment_400274" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T22:54:06+00:00" title="December  9, 2012 10:54PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2012 10:55PM by Hexabolic.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not recalling all the details, but the party proceeds onto the path, which is about wide enough to allow two people to walk abreast.  They go around the corner, see the citadel, and draw a volley of arrows from the hobgoblins.<br/><br/>Everybody dodges.  Mist <i>(partial success)</i> gets out of the way, but teeters on the edge of the precipice.  Ingor also <i>(partial success)</i> dodges, but slips on some gravel and finds himself prone and sliding toward the edge of the path.  Rhavaniel the Ranger gets clear, and sends an arrow into the throat of one of the hobgoblins before ducking back around the curve of the path.  Lostariel the Assassin also gets out of the way but falls and slides nearly to the edge.  Amber never ventured out, so she's perfectly safe.<br/><br/>Things look grim.  Mist <i>(success) </i>recovers her balance and cuts an arrow out of the air with her elven sword, which also <i>(partial success)</i> Causes Fear on the orc-kin hobgoblins and deters the next volley as the hobs suffer from a momentary panic.  This passes as they recall their superior tactical position atop the battlements with a clear killing field on the path beneath them.  It also means they'll target Mist more than the other characters.<br/><br/>Ingor <i>(partial success) </i>uses his iron spike (I'd forgotten that was his other purchase aside from rations and torches) to secure himself on the path, but he can't get his bow out this round.  Lostariel <i>(partial success)</i> grabs onto a handhold as she slips over the cliff's edge.  She's unable to haul herself up, and <i> (success with Decipher)</i> hears the hob sergeant shouting orders for the garrison to loose another volley.  She yells this to the party at large.<br/><br/>Mist darts over and <i>(success)</i> hauls Lostariel to safety and <i>(success)</i> they manage to lunge around the curve of the path in time to avoid the arrows headed their way.  Ingor rolls away, leaving his spike, and <i>(partial success)</i> gets back around the curve with only 2HP damage from an arrow grazing him.<br/><br/>I picture everyone breathing hard and trying to figure out what to do next.  Rhavaniel and Ingor pop out and pick off a couple more hobs, Ingor's falling dramatically off the battlement and tumbling down the cliff.  The rest of the hobgoblins stick hard to cover after that.  Another attempt by Rhavaniel to pop out and nail another defender <i>(failure)</i> draws a flurry of arrows.  Rather than pull a hard move on Rhavanial directly, I decide the hobgoblins have gotten really confident.  With dusk falling, their night sight makes them more at home.  I describe the purpling sky and the the first stars appearing in the heavens as the party tries to figure out what to do.<br/><br/>Then they hear the gate open and the portcullis being drawn up.  The way I figure it, the hobs are going to try a sortie.  Sure, maybe it's not the smartest thing to do, but it's getting dark, they know the party was in trouble and at least one of the invaders is wounded.  Some of this is kind of a gift to the players.  I don't know how they'd take the citadel--there are still over a dozen hobgoblins inside, and those walls are beefy.<br/><br/>Now, I should take a moment to mention the book I found at one of my FLGS.  It's Monsters, by WotC, a full-color, lavishly illustrated hardback book of typical D&amp;D monsters, but geared toward kids.  It was used, so I picked it up for five bucks.  Both moppets found it fun to go through, but Junior Moppet in particular got into it, especially the Frost Worm and Purple Worm.  She had been saying it would be so cool to fight a frost worm, and it was "so cute."  (Yes, yes, she's an odd child with a quirky aesthetic.)  When S had arrived, JM proudly took her through the book, and before long, both girls were excited about the prospects of fighting a 4,000lb. frost worm.  So when they heard the portcullis grate open...JM exclaimed, "They're sending a Frost Worm at us!  We get to fight a Frost Worm!"<br/><br/>"Is that what you think?" I asked.  "Really?  A Frost Worm?"<br/><br/>JM started chanting "Frost Worm! Frost Worm" and S immediately joined in, as did J a moment or two later.<br/><br/>How could I refuse?<br/><br/>"Yes," I said, with a rueful sigh.  "It's true.  The hobgoblins are likely too afraid to face Mist's elven blade, so they've released a monster to destroy you: a terrible, monstrous...<i>Frost Worm!" </i><br/><br/>"Yaaayyy!"<br/><br/>"Woo hoo!"<br/><br/>High fives went around the table.<br/><br/>"This'll be so cool!" crowed JM.  "Hey J, you'll be immune because you have the Resist Cold ring!"<br/><br/>"Ah yes," I said after quickly perusing the Monsters book, "but you've forgotten the dreaded Frost Worm has more to it than freezy breath.  You hear the terrible hypnotic trill come forth, slipping like icy snakes into your minds, coiling around your arms and legs, making it hard to move.  Roll WIS to resist."<br/><br/>Ironically, Mist (their best fighter) shivers and <i>(failure)</i> stiffens to immobility, captivated by the hypnotic trill.  Ingor, Rhavaniel, and Lostariel <i>(partial success)</i> shake off the spell, but not for <i>(die of FATE)</i> two rounds.  The Worm will almost be upon them by then!<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>Showdown with the Frost Worm.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400275/#Comment_400275" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T22:54:47+00:00" title="December  9, 2012 10:54PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 9, 2012 10:56PM by Hexabolic.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Almost everyone is down for the count, at least momentarily.  But Amber <i>(success)</i> resists the insidious creature's charm.  It's all up to her.  Unfortunately, she's used up her Quicksilver quota for the day, and she's not a fighter.<br/><br/>I decided then to try out an optional WoD magic rule someone posted.  I sketched a pentacle on JM's character sheet and said, "You remember some of your Lore mentions that you can open your mind to the otherworld and summon spirits without quicksilver, Amber, but it costs you to do so.  Each time you do it, you fill up a point of this star.  When you fill up all five points, the magic will change you forever in some way.  Do you want to risk the terrible--"<br/><br/>"I do it," JM said.  "That sounds So. Cool."  I'd forgotten how much this kid loves adversity for her characters.<br/><br/>Amber wants to summon a fire spirit to hit the Frost Worm, a blue fire spirit so it'll be the hottest kind possible, but there's no fire here for her to draw upon.  Without some of the form, she can't summon unless she has a True Name.  We talk a bit, I describe the high, bleak mountain path, the gloomy vista below, the starry sky above.<br/><br/>"Can I summon a star spirit?" she asks.  "They're fire, right?"<br/><br/>"Hmm.  Maybe.  You still might need a name."  I suggest she might know some constellations and star names via Lore.  As it happens, <i>(success)</i> Amber does!<br/><br/>She opens her mind to the otherworld and calls upon a blue star she'll name later.  When it appears, bursting into serene brilliance on the path before her, she shields her eyes and<i> (critical success) </i>Commands it to "go make that Frost Worm really uncomfortable--burn it in the eyes!"  With a critical, I might make it possible for her to learn more about it and make it part of her stable of spirits, but instead, I decide to give it a damage boost.  She rolls 3d6 (fire against frost) and I double her result of 10.  The spirit flies out and 'splodes into the Frost Worm's mandibled face for 20 points of damage!  It is Blinded as well as hurt.<br/><br/>Next round, the thrashing worm is shrieking, its trill stopped.  Immediately, Ingor, Rhavaniel, and Lostariel snap out of it.  Mist will snap out next round.  The Frost Worm begins to slither down the path toward them.  Ingor steps out to loose an arrow at it, and takes a blast of freezy breath.  His ring <i>(partial success)</i> protects him, but his bowstring snaps.  To J's credit, he took all the setbacks very well.<br/><br/>Amber opens her mind again and this time summons an earth spirit from the mountain itself.  A stone spirit.  It appears, and this time she bargains with it, mostly because I think JM was interested in seeing how bargaining went.  She asks it to collapse the path beneath the Frost Worm, and it agrees if the wizard in turn agrees to destroy the citadel polluting the spirit's mountain.  Amber agrees, and<i> (success)</i> the spirit collapses the path on the cliff's edge, and the blinded Frost Worm topples over and falls to its doom.<br/><br/>High fives all around.  Frost Worm defeated!  We were at a good stopping point by this time, so I called it.  J had a great time, and his dad was really proud of him.<br/><br/>I had a couple of insights from this session.  First, I really have to skim down to one character apiece.  Frequently, JM and S would say, "I do this!" and I'd have to ask "Which 'I'?"  And they've been having trouble keeping their character sheets straight.  Second, I'm not sure if the "open your mind to the otherworld" is too powerful.  I can make Amber's first debility severe, but if it's super cool, will that still leave wizards fairly unlimited?  If we were dealing with older players, I wouldn't hesitate, but the young ones might not care for "your right arm turns to willow wood" or "sunlight burns an exquisite calligraphy of pain into your exposed skin."  But maybe JM would love this stuff, who knows?<br/><br/>It'll be interesting to see how J and C work together.

I set up the campaign over at Obsidian Portal a week or so ago, and the girls just registered and started to populate it with content.  I'll have some time over the holidays to put up stuff there.  Elder Moppet spent some time last night registering her account at the site and making her avatar on Doll Divine.  Watching her excitement, I feel like I've leveled up in some awesome Geek Dad prestige class.<br/><br/>The game was short one player as L was sick and couldn't make it.  I'd asked for snack contribution, because six pre-teens at the table turn out to be something like a pack of hungry dogs about an hour and a half in.  This week, three players brought snacks, so we were basically rolling in food.<br/><br/>We left off our last DG session in the aftermath of the battle with the Skitterlings and their lightning guns and frost globe grenades.  The players started up by doing healing and divvying up the Skitterlings' weaponry.  This was interesting to see who wanted what and how they allocated the energy vials for the lightning guns.  It ended up being pretty egalitarian, though it took awhile because EM and A were doing a lot of interrupting.  EM spends a lot of time at the table drawing and not paying attention, so she has to ask questions about what's going on.  A seems so excited she can't help but interject off-point commentary in the middle of things.  I finally had to stop talking until things settled down.  I explained that I needed player attention so I could paint the scene and let us into the fictional space.  After that, play proceeded more smoothly.<br/><br/>It's been interesting to observe the different personalities and how they interact in the party dynamic.  All the kids except A are a little self-conscious about roleplaying in dramatic fashion, but they're becoming more relaxed.  There was some gentle banter going on among the group this week, and I didn't catch much of it, but it seems the players are beginning to gel.  I suspect what's happening is the evolution of trust, which will let them engage more with the acting aspects of the game as they feel safe exposing their creative ideas to the group.<br/><br/>M is very organized and forthright.  She has her character sheets in a plastic folder, she shows up ready to play, and is engaged throughout the session.  Of all the players, she's been the one quickest to offer compliments and feedback.<br/><br/>F is a quiet but confident kid; he's been loosening up and starting to get into his character, which is fun to watch.  His depiction of Niff is painting a picture of a tough, practical mercenary who focuses on getting the job done.  At the same time, it's not the overbaked machismo so typical of middle school boys.  He's starting to offer some tactical leadership in battle, but it's been very low-key so far.<br/><br/>G is also sharp and engaged, and has been trying some roleplaying of her Paladin <i>Arsalan</i> (I've been misspelling it all this time).  G has taken the role of note-taker, particularly with regard to treasure, and she and M seem to be assuming a bit more of a leadership role, at least in terms of kitten-herding the others.  She and M are the main collaborators of the group.<br/><br/>L is naturally very quiet, for all that she's the most seasoned gamer with her own polyhedrals.  She is, however, paying attention and has contributed some great ideas.  It's been fun to watch her comfort level grow, and the joyous expression on her face when she blew fire into the Wraith's face was priceless.<br/><br/>A is the queen of drama here, and I mean that in a good way.  She's a natural actor, and has been doing a lot of online gaming and some gaming with her family.  She's also got a ton of backstory worked up, with her character's father basically being Voldemort for all intents and purposes.  She does have a little trouble not interrupting, or knowing when not to try to shoehorn her story into the current scene, but her enthusiasm and creativity is inspiring.<br/><br/>My daughter EM is actually kind of the bete noire at the table.  She's often squirrely and seemingly more focused on drawing than on the game.  But though she's been disconnected from time to time, when there's a combat, she's the one who comes up with a tactical choice that changes the battle in a fundamental way.  She's been getting increasingly excited about the story and larger campaign, and we've talked about her behavior, so I hope to see more consideration going forward.  In talking with her, she admitted she was feeling constrained and uninspired by the dungeon environment, so we'll see what the wider World of Dungeons has in store for her.<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b> The prisoners of the three cells.</i><br/><br/><i>Edited to redact some perhaps-too-personal observations of my daughter's table habits.

Thanks for the kind words.<br/><br/>Taking up the Dungeon Girls narrative again, they decided to check out the cellblock Arian the Ranger had scouted on the last session, before the throwdown with the Skitterlings.  The block contained three cells protected by stout, iron-bound wooden doors with Judas holes sealed by small latched covers.  I hadn't prepped much for the game, and what I had prepped was treasure and monster stuff for a potential showdown with an Avatar of dread Klassh'Tuu.  I didn't have the foggiest notion what or who was in these cells, but here I was, Johnny on the spot, so I turned to a prop for inspiration.<br/><br/>A couple of years ago, I picked up a Harrow Deck from Paizo.  This is a pseudo-Tarot deck of 54 trumps drawn from D&amp;D imagery, with clever suit concept based on cross-referencing the nine D&amp;D3E alignments with the six classic stats.  Every card represents a particular alignment and stat, such as the Lawful Good Constitution card, etc.  The art is decent, and some of the images are pretty interesting.  Anyway, I drew three to give me some help for the cells, figuring they'd represent the cells from left to right, matching up with the position of the three doors.<br/><br/>I drew <b>The Paladin</b> <i>(Lawful Good - STR),</i> <b>The Teamster</b> <i>(True Neutral - CON),</i> and <b>The Crows</b><i> (Neutral Evil - DEX).</i>  The Paladin shows the predictable: a noble knight armored in gold with a winged helmet.  Cell <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> would have a captive Paladin, and he'd test their strength, either of their moral resolve or possibly by feat of arms.  The Teamster shows a masked dwarf with a whip riding on the shoulders of a huge brute.  I immediately had the idea that this was Nunk's master, Dimitrios Brog, an obnoxious slave master who used Nunk as a mount, servant, and freak show attraction.  I thought he'd test the players' patience. The third card, The Crows, shows three crow-headed individuals playing a game of chance.  I figured these would be three petty thieves from the city above: cunning, completely dishonest, and opportunistic in a malevolent way.  They'd test the players' quickness and cleverness.<br/><br/>Niff has Awareness, so he listens <i>(partial success)</i> at all three cells.  From the first cell he hears what sounds like quiet prayer.  From the second, whining and complaints about the food, the general situation, how unlucky Brog was, and so on.  From the third come sounds of a quarrel, shoving and scraping and curses.  Unfortunately, Nunk bellows something about how happy he is that his friends are safe, and Brog--the dwarf slaver--hears him.  Immediately, Brog shouts orders to Nunk, stuff like, "Get me out of here, you worthless meathead!  Hurry!"  Some of the girls actually growl on hearing this.  They've become quite protective of Nunk, and had been speculating about having a house and having Nunk be the housekeeper.  I'd chosen a whiny nasal voice for Brog, perfect for grating on the nerves.<br/><br/>Brog demands release and return of his property (Nunk).  While Arselan and Arian argue with him, Niff picks the lock on the cell. Brog becomes a lot less aggressive once he sees the well-armed group outside.  Nunk is cowed and afraid, and the players try to reassure him while Niff asks several times if he could just slap Brog.  Arselan the Paladin replies no, that's not honorable.  I describe how the scars Nunk has look like whip marks, and as Brog wails about how is he going to get around without his mount, the characters note how some of the marks on Nunk's shoulders look like callouses from a saddle strap.<br/><br/>Outrage blooms around the table.  However, slavery is legal in this city of Shardeej, and Brog claims he has papers to show his lawful ownership.  Papers!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Niff <i>(partial success)</i> opens the next cell and releases the Paladin, who immediately kicks the door open and leaps out, seizing Niff's sword hilt and trying to draw it.  Niff (success on STR) grabs the Paladin's forearm and prevents him from clearing the blade.  During this moment of standoff, Arselan <i>(success on CHA-Leadership)</i> talks the fellow down.<br/><br/>The Paladin, whose name turns out to be Bulat al-Mansour, is weak from lack of food.  He explains how he was captured by the cultists and how grateful he is that the players have come in answer to his prayers.  There follows a negotiation with Brog, and Andromeda the Necromancer finally offers to buy Nunk from him for 300 silvers.  Brog immediately counters with 400, and I have fun hamming up a typical haggling session.  After some back and forth, Andromeda proposes 360, and I rub my chin and then jab a finger at her and shout, "Done!"<br/><br/>The players gasp, and Niff and Arian comment that they'd rather shank Brog (in essence) than acknowledge he has any claim on Nunk.  Arselan and Burat want to free Nunk as well, and are inclined to simply declare him free, though they'd be in trouble from the authorities.  Andromeda eventually convinces the others that buying Nunk would be the best way to achieve their goal without any legal trouble, and Arselan and Arian each put up a third of the purchase price.  A disbelieving Nunk is told he's free, but he doesn't know what to do with that.  Brog offers to buy him back for 100 silvers, and Niff finally slaps him.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> The Crows and out of the dungeon into...an ambush!</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400634/#Comment_400634" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-12T19:08:11+00:00" title="December 12, 2012  7:08PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really glad Niff slapped him after all.

Junior Moppet is the source of many amazing quotes from her quirky, powerful imagination.  UserClone, your pony avatar would make my daughters totally squee.<br/><br/>Yes, this is really the first full roleplaying encounter the group had, without a monster of one kind or another breathing down their necks.  It was fun to offer the moral contrast between Brog and Bulat.<br/><br/>Paul, I've cribbed a few house rules from here and there.  Here are a few:<br/><br/><b>AWESOME POINTS.</b>  We're using Awesome Points from Old School Hack, offered pretty much whenever someone rolls a crit or does something awesome.  I tried the Other Worlds approach of handing everyone two chips to offer to other players as Fan Mail, so we'll see how that goes.  One Awesome Point can be used to heal 1 HP, grant a +1 bonus to a roll, or make a small narrative statement about the immediate scene, such as "there's a lantern hanging from a pole at the edge of the plaza" or "these chains have a lot of rust and might have some weaker parts."  So far, nobody's used them for this last bit.  They've effectively been using their Awesome Points as a pool, so long as the holder can narrate some way in which they're helping the person who needs the points.  You can spend as many AweP as you like in a round.<br/><br/><b>THE PENTAGRAM.</b>  I just started this with Dungeon Kids.  The original suggestion was to draw a five-point star on the mage's character sheet and allow the wizard to open his or her mind to the otherworld as an alternative to the other ways of summoning a spirit (e.g., quicksilver dose, hour-long ritual, magical contain).  The cost is that if you fill up all five points of the star, you gain a Madness debility as a permanent feature of the character.  Since Madness doesn't necessarily play too well with this age set, I'm opting for the magical warps or tells you'd see in Ars Magica.  These would include things like eyes glowing when you get angry, a powerful smell of wet dog rising from you whenever you enter someone's home, a cool breeze following the direction of your gaze, your voice takes on a brassy echo, your fingernails grow super-fast, and so on.  The challenge is to keep the warp something fun and interesting that a third-grader (especially) can keep in mind.  <br/><br/>Not totally sold on it yet, though.  It may make Wizardly types too powerful.<br/><br/><b>ENCUMBRANCE.</b>  I reworked the pack sheet to simplify things.  Basically, you can carry whatever you can write in the pack space so long as it would make sense to fit into your pack (so no halberds, for example).  The actual writing space constraints impose the limit.  This isn't a group that needs to do extensive bean counting, and I got the feeling that a close tracking of encumbrance would prove a fun-killer.  This isn't a huge deal with the Dungeon Girls because Valavanora has a Satchel of Holding.<br/><br/><b>LIGHT.</b>  This has been fun.  I posted these on a previous page, but basically, a torch lights up the space in a 1 person radius around the torch, beyond that it's Dim (sight awareness penalties), Shadowy (murky glimpses of movement), and Dark.  Lanterns give more light, Bullseye Lanterns give more light in one direction.  Torches and Lanterns also have burn times I can't remember here.  These rules seem pretty intuitive, and the players have picked them up quickly.<br/><br/><b>LUCK.</b>  I'm basically interpreting the Lucky Special Ability to give that player bonuses on the Die of Fate and the benefit of the doubt in luck-dominated situations.  A single reroll per session seems too weak for a Special Ability.  Mist took Lucky, though, and I need to remember it.<br/><br/><b>PETS.</b>  So far, I've been letting the player roll with a +2 bonus for something in the Pet's domain.  The Ranger's lion is good at Mauling the Beans out of someone, for instance.  The Druid's peregrine falcon is good at getting all flappy-talony in your face.  I may end up statting them up a little more to grant Skills and Special Abilities like <i>Roar</i> and <i>Fly</i>, letting the players run them directly as secondary characters.<br/><br/><b>NARROW SKILLS.</b>  Magical items in the game or other special gear can grant narrow skills like <i>Resist Fire</i> or <i>Climb Sheer Surface.</i>  These work like any other skill in the game for die rolling purposes, but within a more specific fictional domain.  So you can't fail to Resist Fire when the dragon breathes on you--unless you need Resist Dragon's Fire--but you might be dazzled or have a hard time breathing if you roll a failure.<br/><br/><b>SPIRITS.</b>  I've basically adjudicated the summoning of spirits you don't already have as Allies (like a magic user's two starting spirits) to require you have one of the desired spirit's Domains at hand.  Alternatively, you need that Spirit's True Name.  Otherwise, to summon a Fire Spirit, you need some kind of fire.  The more you have, the stronger a spirit you can summon.  Once the spirit arrives, you either have to bargain with it or Command it.  If you don't have the Command Special Ability, you better be a good negotiator.  The nature of the spirit determines how the bargain goes.  My experience playing <i>Werewolf: The Apocalypse </i>gave me a lot of great ideas on how to play spirits (I remember our Glass Walker Theurge calling the spirit of Helicopter for an evac, using two torches to wave the spirit down to the LZ).<br/><br/>I'll generally give more latitude and scope for spirit domain effects that aren't direct damage, but change the environment in some fashion.  That's more interesting and rewards clever magic users.<br/><br/>Basically, these two groups with a combined eleven players are working like a World of Dungeons Lab.<br/><br/>I just had the Dungeon Girls meet to brainstorm backstories and world details, and they've taken off with the drama and orphan stories.  Over at the Dungeon Girls Obsidian Portal campaign, they're filling in bios and other world content, making avatars, and so forth.  Arselan's player listed Chocolate as an Item, saying you can't leave it out of your rations.  :-)  Arian (finally) named her Lion: <i>Hodari</i>, which means brave.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400723/#Comment_400723" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T16:20:01+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  4:20PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1,000,000                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400730/#Comment_400730" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T17:12:39+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  5:12PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These APs are amazing.

They open the door to the third cell, and Bulat warns that this one holds ne'er do well street thugs.  Some minor kerfluffle ensues when one of the "crows" tries to get in their faces, but Arselan and Niff are sufficiently intimidating <i>(Arselan success on a Leadership roll)</i> to convince them to submit to being tied in a coffle with their hands bound.  Arian <i>(partial success) </i>uses Survival to do the tying, and with a few glares and idle threats toward Brog, whom these three thugs seem to know, the party exits the dungeon.<br/><br/>They make their way through the hallways, seeing no sign of cultists, finally exiting the ground floor through a door onto a narrow paved street.  By narrow, it's basically a bit wider than a single lane road.  <br/><br/>It is the middle of the night, dark as hell except for the single torch the party still has, and Sklarah's candle cantrip.  The buildings on either side are about two stories high.  There's a small fountain in the middle of the street a short distance away, just visible in the torchlight.  As the party stands on the street, discussing where to go from here, Niff <i>(failure on Awareness)</i> senses movement on the rooftops, but not in time to warn anyone.  There's a bit of a distraction as one of the Crows slips his bonds and tries to escape, but Arian and Arselan brace him before he can get away.<br/><br/>Then the arrows and bolts fall on them as the remaining score of cultists let loose.  Chaos breaks out.  Everyone leaps this way and that, trying to get safe.  The cultists turn out to be lousy shots.  The Crows bug out, two of them taking minor wounds from arrows.  Nunk is hit, to everyone's chagrin.  Arselan gets his shield up to protect Nunk.  Arian draws the bow she borrowed from Niff and picks off a cultist with a well-placed arrow.  Lucius the Cleric (NPC today) is hit, and drops the torch.  Sklarah (also an NPC today) douses her candle flame and ducks back inside the door.  Niff puts on the defective owl goggles that grant Darkvision Only in Total Darkness.  Thus equipped, he heads for the meager cover of the fountain and pulls a lightning gun.   Andromeda goes to the near wall and prepares to climb it to get to the cultists on the roof.  Valavanora moves toward the opposite wall and prepares to call on one of her spirits.  Bulat takes an arrow but isn't hurt.  Arselan takes a couple of arrows, but his armor prevents him from taking serious damage.<br/><br/>I was pretty surprised the first round didn't scuttle a whole bunch of HP, but the characters rolled well.  I haven't imposed penalties yet.  That may happen in future for killing grounds, but there wasn't a need here as it was pretty exciting, and everyone felt threatened.<br/><br/>Next round: Andromeda (success) climbs the wall and arrives at the roof's edge with her assassin's dagger.  She promptly <i>(partial success) </i>shanks one of the cultists, but the second one freaks and clubs her with his crossbow.  I was going to have her teeter on the edge, Dazed, but A suggests the blow knocks Andromeda unconscious so she plummets into the street.  "You sure?" I ask.  "Yes!" she replies.  Yowza.  Awesome Point!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Niff <i>(partial success)</i> uses his lightning gun to blow a cultist to paradise in Klassh'Tuu's fanged gut, but sees they're pulling up a freakin' wide-bore cannon to point into the alley.  He correctly deduces this is a blunderbuss thing, full of scrap and shrap, and a cultist behind it holds a smouldering match.  The rest of the cultists are preparing to fire again, cocking their crossbows.  This round's arrow fire goes (die of FATE) primarily toward the bewildered and hurt Nunk, who takes about five hits while Brog cowers behind him and screams he's not with these people, he's not one of them!<br/><br/>Motivation spikes among the group: these cultists must pay for this!  M expresses the plaintive hope that Nunk doesn't die.<br/><br/>Arian <i>(partial success)</i> throws herself under the falling Andromeda and catches her, but is hammered to the ground by the impact, taking some HP damage.  Valavanora, in the middle of the street, summons her fiery phoenix spirit Koriander, who arrives in purple flame.  Niff is immediately blinded and pushes the goggles up onto his forehead.  He decides against trying a lightning gun shot at the cannoneer for fear of setting off the powder.  Instead, he races to that wall and <i>(success)</i> climbs up, grabs a cultist and jerks the hapless sod caterwauling to the street.<br/><br/>The cultists are getting ready to shoot, but Valavanora <i>(success) </i>orders Koriander to burn all the bowstrings, which I thought a brilliant tactic.  Streaking like a purple comet, the spirit immediately turns all the bowstrings to ashes...starting with Arian's.  Yeah, it was a success, but I figured EM needed a little cautionary note about taking care with spirit instruction.  Plus the cultists are now effectively neutered...except for the cannon.<br/><br/>Arian pushes herself up, pulls a lightning gun, and fires at the cannoneer, taking the shot Niff didn't.  Failure!  The bolt arcs right into the cannon's bore and there's a clap of thunder as the cannon discharges in an explosion!  Shrapnel lashes the street, dealing damage to basically everyone.  Valavanora <i>(failure)</i> collapses, still too close to Death as she hits 0 HP.  The well-armored Arselan <i>(success)</i>shrugs off most of the shrap that comes his way, and immediately runs out to try to heal Valavanora.  Arian (partial failure) evades damage, but suffers a scar.<br/><br/>This was funny.  I suggested a cool facial scar, and the girls all sat up straight, shaking their heads.  Not in the face!  They start talking about maybe a shoulder scar or collarbone scar that looks cool but can be concealed.  I suggest Arian could lose an eye, which would be interesting, and M starts to think about that, with some misgivings.  A offers the idea that maybe Arian could get a cool cat eye replacement, and she starts to warm to the idea of a Ranger with an eyepatch.<br/><br/>The cultists flee in the face of all this table-turning.  Niff <i>(success)</i> draws his sword and stabs one through the heart.  Arselan <i>(success)</i> heals Valavanora, as his goddess decides the heathen druid has acted honorably enough today.  G's comment is, "Yeah, yeah.  Honor.  I get it."  I can't wait for the goddess to buff the Paladin when he acts in the name of honor, but right now it's clear the goddess is a bit on the judgmental side.  Nunk the pincushion lives, but barely.  He's in need of arrow-pulling and healing.  Nobody is happy to see Brog crawl out unharmed.  Bulat is OK too, having slipped to the side and healed himself, though he's still weak.<br/><br/>That's pretty much where we left off.  M's mom arrived, and M greets her with "I might have lost an eye! I haven't decided yet!"  Then my wife shows up, and when she asks if anyone died, she's told "EM died again!"  Valavanora hadn't died, not quite.  But 0 HP is close enough to count, I guess.  There's a lot of excited chatter and talk about what to do with Nunk and what they're going to buy when they go shopping again.<br/><br/>EM decided she wants her Death Aspect to be a sort of Winter tell, with the touch of her hands leaving frost trails.  Thanks to the Story Games Names Project and Shreyas for that idea, by the way.  Pretty sweet.<br/><br/>Next time, we'll see how and where they want to go in the wide World of Dungeons.  Their backstories are pretty cool, I have to say.  I'll have a metric ton of material to work with.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400772/#Comment_400772" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T00:20:49+00:00" title="December 14, 2012 12:20AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A post-script.

They're a nice alternative to HP loss, especially where the circumstances point toward a non-damaging result.  I use them as soft moves if they're of very short duration, like when a player becomes momentarily Blinded.  For hard moves, they work great for longer-lasting penalties.  The restriction is either really clear from the fiction (e.g., Blinded) or I might assign a penalty of -1 or maaaaybe -2 depending on the severity of the fictional context.  I also might just ramp up the fictional consequences of a miss (essentially what you reminded me is another axis to work on).  I have told players that the particular Condition meant no modifier to the die roll, but would make failure way more complicated.  As I think about it, that's my preferred method: to use Conditions less as mechanical modifiers and more as modifiers of the fictional stakes.<br/><br/>I started out with a list of a dozen Conditions, and the players came up with a bunch more, so now I have the basic set and a bunch of blank ones on the character sheets.

I can make Amber's first debility severe, but if it's super cool, will that still leave wizards fairly unlimited?  If we were dealing with older players, I wouldn't hesitate, but the young ones might not care for "your right arm turns to willow wood" or "sunlight burns an exquisite calligraphy of pain into your exposed skin."  But maybe JM would love this stuff, who knows?</blockquote>\nYeah, you don't want to make it too harsh, but equally if it's not harsh enough (or if she thinks the consequences are cool) then it becomes a practically unlimited resource.<br/><br/>I found the end of this DKids encounter really interesting and I think there's some potential mileage in playing the old 'with great power comes great responsibility' card. If JM learns that when Amber opens her mind that there are always unforeseen consequences then it'll naturally make her more cautious about using it as she won't know what the true cost will be. For example:<br/>- bargaining with the stone spirit - the first thing this says to me is that Amber is racking up obligations; she's going to have to ensure this citadel's destroyed now. And what is she doesn't? What will the consequences be from the stone spirit? Will they refuse to obey her in the future? Will they exact some greater retribution?<br/><br/>- summoning a star spirit - I love that she thought of this, and it has huge Dark Phoenix-like potential for consequences. I think of star spirits and I think of star gods: Immense; Unimaginable Power; Vastly Distant; Alien; Unknowable. I wonder why star spirits aren't summoned more often. What danger could they represent? Has Amber's actions brought the star closer to the world - causing climate change for example? Has it opened some kind of underworld bridge so that star spirits may start appearing even when not summoned? What are the star spirits' true intentions?<br/><br/>So possibly the result of opening your mind too many times is that unexpected consequences occur from those actions. Stuff occurs that you realise you're responsible for and which the party then have to deal with - and which might then require a sacrifice of some kind to fix. So rather than have it leaving a disabling or dementing mark on the character, it could explicitly lead to great complications (and further adventures) which would then lead the player themselves to limit their use. (e.g. "Are you sure you want to fill that last section? Do you remember how hard it was to get the star spirits to leave the world alone?")<br/><br/>Anyway, just some thoughts.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein" title="Nifelhein"><img alt="Nifelhein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/888/nUG22UPKX7MJD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein">Nifelhein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400877/#Comment_400877" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-14T14:28:03+00:00" title="December 14, 2012  2:28PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Thanks.

The frost worm plummeted into the depths in a plume of rubble and dust, as the hobgoblins crouched with their crossbows up on the battlement.  The party had withdrawn around the bend, leaving a 25-foot gap in the already treacherous path leading to the citadel's heavy iron-bound gate, which was backed by a portcullis.<br/><br/>It's cold, the sun has set, and the wind howls through the mountain night, almost putting out the party's single guttering torch.  All the characters (except Ingor the Elf Archer, who enjoys the protection of his magical Resist Cold ring) shiver in the sudden chill that descends with nightfall.  Will they retreat into the dungeon and hole up in the bugbear's quarters?<br/><br/>No, they decide they want to stay outside and ponder an attack on the citadel.  But how will they manage to take effective counsel while the cold bites ever deeper?<br/><br/>Amber the Wizard decides to open her mind to the Otherworld again, this time to summon a Fire spirit.  She thinks about summoning The Book of Ice to see if it can use its Cold domain to move the cold away from them, but concludes the spirit might not be terribly happy about working in the service of Warmth.  So she <i>(success) </i>summons a salamander from the party's torch flame.  It crawls onto the path before her, the wind whipping the red flames spilling off its lizardy form.  "How shall I ssserve you, wizard?" it asks.<br/><br/>Amber could Command it, but she's decided she likes bargaining, and wonders if Commanding spirits is mean.  So she asks the salamander to make a fire to keep everyone warm.  The salamander blinks and asks how it can do that without enough wood to burn.  There follows some discussion with the bewildered spirit, but Amber asks if it can use the entire torch but burn in a way that keeps everyone warm throughout the night.  The salamander <i>(CHA partial success)</i> agrees this is possible, but it would take much effort on its part to draw so much heat for so long out of such paltry fuel.  What will the wizard do to make such an effort worthwhile?<br/><br/>Amber answers she would be willing to render it a service, of course.  What would the salamander like?  It thinks a moment, then answers that it has always dreamed of burning something large and interesting of structure.  If Amber will help it to consume such a thing at some point in the future, it would gladly provide warmth through the night from that torch.  She agrees, and to seal the bargain, the salamander wishes to leave a mark upon her little finger.<br/><br/>"Oh, like pinkie swearing," JM says.<br/><br/>"Yes," I reply.  "Exactly."<br/><br/>So the salamander's fiery tongue whips out and coils for an instant around Amber's pinkie, searing a brand into her flesh for 1 HP.  I tell JM the HP will heal only when she completes her bargain.  The salamander has her take a splinter from the torch to cast into whatever she will allow him to burn in the future.  Then he scuttles into the torch, which Romrama drops on the path, and a bonfire sized flame leaps up to warm the party.<br/><br/>JM fills in a third point on Amber's pentagram.<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>A gap in the night, and much attendant skulking.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401019/#Comment_401019" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T19:18:09+00:00" title="December 16, 2012  7:18PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the salamander providing warmth despite the mountain wind, Romrama decides to sleep.  He promptly lies down with a cloak as his blanket and begins to snore.  However, Rhavaniel and Mist decide to try to climb across the gap, screw the dark and cold and wind.  Rhavaniel is clearly willing to embrace Death, S having heard how cool Valavanora's encounter with the Grim Reaper was over in the Dungeon Girls' side of the pool.  Mist, at least, puts on her climbing claws and ties a rope around her waist.  Ingor holds the rope.<br/><br/>I tell them it's gonna be a Athletics CON test instead of DEX, because of the terrible conditions.  Both characters have high DEX, so this gives them pause.  I explain, "Hey, you guys can cross this sort of gap in your sleep, but the dark, the cold, and this chilly, damp wind?  Yeah, it's how tough and determined you are in this case."  I do give Mist a +1 for the climbing claws.<br/><br/>J didn't show, incidentally, probably because I neglected to send out reminders this week.<br/><br/>Rhavaniel <i>(crit) </i>crosses the gap easily, though it takes a little while.  She immediately goes to Scout the citadel, and slips up to the stone wall by the massive gate.  Here she can listen in on the hobgoblins, who are busy gambling and eating.  She<i> (partial success)</i> overhears them talking about the very interesting topic of favorite foods.  One of the hobs goes on about how he likes his Dwarf.  "Fried in butter with turnips, or better yet, dowsed with oil and set afire so's he gets all crispy."  I play this out with the voices, and the kids giggle and C growls as Romrama (very likely) has a bad dream moment or two.  It's pretty fun, and I hoped to establish the hobs as bonafide Bad Guys.  The hobs also speculate that the adventurers probably fell to their deaths with the frost worm.  "Too bad about the dwarf," says the culinary one.<br/><br/>Mist <i>(failure) </i>gets across, but at a cost.  I start to describe how the rocks on the opposite ledge crumble under her hand, and she has to scramble to keep her grip without pulling Ingor to the brink.  S pushes over a couple of Awesome Points to move things to a partial success.  Instead of directly jeopardizing the party, I describe how the rocks clatter down and create a small landslide below, making a ruckus.  A suspicous hobgoblin pokes his head up to have a look, and I have both JM and R make Stealth rolls.<br/><br/>They<i> (both crit) </i>successfully elude the hobgoblin's scan, despite his night vision.  Mist swings down below the lip of the precipice, secured by her claws.  Rhavaniel simply flattens herself to the wall directly below the hobgoblin.  The hobs are sufficiently lulled to decide there's really nothing out there.  Maybe it was an adventurer falling to its death, they joke.  Har-har-har.<br/><br/>The kids are really motivated to get these guys now.  They're mean!<br/><br/>The other characters cross easily on the rope, held on either end by Ingor and Mist.  Romrama makes a crit for his crossing, so he's over in a flash.  Ingor, his player not being here, fills the role of utility NPC and stays behind to hold the rope, while Mist puts a rock on the other end to hold it down.  The party approaches the citadel and takes council at the base of the wall.<br/><br/>There's some chit-chat about what to do next.  Rhavaniel is all about going solo, and it's clear S is begging for death so as to have Rhavaniel become cool.  She's not inclined to cooperate.  I tell them to go into another room and Make A Plan.  None of this haphazard stuff.  These are tough, mean hobgoblins, and they're not going to fool around.  I must have been convincing, because the kids pelt off like puppies to JM's room.  I pour myself another cup of tea while I wait.<br/><br/>Their energy has been pretty good so far.  I'd let them have over an hour of playtime before we started, and that seemed to get most (not all!) of their ya-yas out.  But this little break would hopefully help as well.  C had been trying to take S's socks off under the table, which was probably a result of Romrama not having much to do as of yet.  This would change very soon, with much carnage as the result.<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>The final assault on the Citadel!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401023/#Comment_401023" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T20:42:38+00:00" title="December 16, 2012  8:42PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2012 8:43PM by Hexabolic.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The kids returned with a Cunning Plan.  Well, not so much on the cunning side.  It was really a straightforward plan that let everyone do what they wanted: Rhavaniel would scale the wall to try to catch the hobgoblins off guard and create a diversion; Amber would summon a wood spirit to open the gate, then an iron spirit to deal with the portcullis; Romrama would ready his axe to unleash havoc upon the hobgoblins.<br/><br/>It goes well at first.  Rhavaniel <i>(crit)</i> scales the wall easily, finding lots of handholds and slipping over the top in utter silence.  The two hobgoblins occuping the section of wall over the gate and between the towers don't notice a thing as she slides into the shadows of the tower door.  Amber opens her mind and <i>(partial success)</i> summons the wood spirit within the door, albeit with much creaking and groaning as the wood shifts and shudders under the stirring spirit's .<br/><br/>"Do you Command it?" I say, after describing the huge face pushing out of the wood, knotholes forming eyes, splintery lips splitting out of the layered planks with a sharp crack.<br/><br/>"No, I like to bargain."<br/><br/>Sure?  Yes, she's sure.<br/><br/>"What do you will, wizard?" the wood spirit groans though its heavy plank lips.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, all this wood noise has alerted even these complacent hobs, so they go on alert.  One leans over the gate to look down in horror.  "The adventurers!" he bellows.  "They're here!  <i>There's</i> one, right down there!"<br/><br/>He and his buddy proceed to crank their crossbows.  At this point, Rhavaniel sighs, nocks an arrow to her bow, and proceeds to crit the bejabbers out of one, putting an arrow into his...<br/><br/>"Eye, Daddy!" JM crows.<br/><br/>"Yeah, oooh, the eye!" C chimes in.<br/><br/>"Yeah," says S, a gleam in her own eye.<br/><br/>OK, the hob pauses as if confused, starts to shake his finger in Rhavaniel's direction, snarls at her, then drops like a sack of oatmeal.  The kids' attention has (finally) become really focused.  They can smell the fictional blood.  The second one continues to crank his crossbow harder.  Rather than engage further, Rhavaniel backs through the door at her back into the tower.<br/><br/>JM says S wants Rhavaniel to die, so she's pushing toward that.  S herself comments that she's rolling too well, which she is.  I have the kids roll into a round die tray in the middle of the table, partly to keep dice results from going all over hell and gone, but also to encourage suspense and transparency.<br/><br/>Romrama has his fighting spirits up and is ready to put the axe to some hobs.  He (crit) climbs the wall himself, surprising everyone with his agility.  Because it's a crit, I let him make a roll at the top to see if he can grab the other hob and hurl him off the wall.  He <i>(success)</i> does, though at first C wants to seize him by the throat and strangle him, but after I tell him that might take a few rounds, he decides to go with the hob toss.  Because he rolls a success, he doesn't drop the monster on Amber's head.<br/><br/>Amber has been busy negotiating with the wood spirit.  It says it wants to be alive again, so it will serve if she will take a shard and plant it in a mighty forest far from the horror of axes and saws.  She suggests the Druid Lands, and the spirit agrees enthusiastically, drawing aside the reinforced gate like a curtain.  Amber opens her mind a fifth time and <i>(crit)</i> summons the iron spirit of the portcullis.  This one doesn't need much persuading.  It wants to be left alone and not hauled up and down anymore, so it simply rattles and snakes open a hole big enough for Amber, Mist, and Lostariel to step through.<br/><br/>JM was definitely more focused on Amber this session, which was actually cool.  Likewise, S was more into Rhavaniel, so this made things a lot easier for me to run.<br/><br/>The trio enters the grounds, and are immediately confronted with a half dozen hobs, some of them still struggling to put on their helmets and arm themselves.  One races toward a smaller building off to the side, a key in his hand.  Another is bawling orders to shoot these intruders right damn now!  The key-wielding hob reaches a big door and jams the key into a hole, preparing to turn it and release what I have decided is a big troll, the classic Gygaxian regenerating kind (which I play like its inspiration, the troll from Poul Anderson's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Three Hearts and Three Lions</span>).  The three guards in Tower One prepare to fight, while the lone hob on Tower Two grabs its weapons and charges down the stairs to where Rhavaniel lurks.<br/><br/>Romrama surges up the stairs of Tower One, screaming dwarvish battle cries.  The three hobs decide to gang up on him and as the Imperial Dwarf reaches the top of the tower, they yell and charge!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rhavaniel pulls her dagger and tries to gut the hob rushing down the stairs, but <i>(failure)</i> gets shield rushed instead, and is slammed hard into a wall, which imposes the Dazed condition on her.  S has a little smile on her face.  Failure at last!<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b> The Thing Behind the Door, hobgoblin havoc, and a hostage!</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401029/#Comment_401029" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T22:05:09+00:00" title="December 16, 2012 10:05PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2012 3:21PM by Hexabolic.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amber is Dazed from too much Otherworldly exposure.  She reels over to lean against the nearest wall.  Lostariel blends into the shadows and makes her way toward the hob with the key in the mysterious door.  Mist unsheathes her Elven Sword of Tirandel and it <i>(success) </i>flares with wrathful blue light, Causing Fear in Orc-kind.<br/><br/>The attacking hobgoblins freeze in their tracks, dumbstruck.  The one with the key starts to panic, but redoubles his attempt to open the lock, terror making him clumsy and delaying him.<br/><br/>Mist assumes an intimidating stance and<i> (success on a CHA roll despite her CHA of 0)</i> routs the hobgoblins.  They turn and run, stripping armor and dropping weapons as they go, heading back into the keep and the secret passage to the dungeon below.  The one continues to twist the key frantically.  The door shudders as something big strikes it from inside, and a deep voice says, "Hooo."<br/><br/>But the hobgoblins on and in the tower aren't affected by the Sword of Tirendel, because they can't see it.  C describes how Romrama drops his shield and leaps amid the hobgoblins, axe held in a two-handed grip, and makes a whirling strike to hit all three.  I decide to deal with this like the Cleave feat from 3E.  Romrama <i>(success)</i> beheads the first outright, earning a roll against the second, which he also succeeds at with enough damage to kill it, thereby gaining a shot at the third.  Here, a partial success means it takes half damage.  But S pushes over an Awesome Point to bring Romrama up to a full success.  It's not enough to kill the hob, though, so I describe how Romrama's axe shatters the hobgoblin's shield and deals a mighty wound to its arm.  The wounded hobgoblin staggers back against the parapet, its arm hanging useless.  It throws away its meat-cleaver sword and cowers, begging for mercy.<br/><br/>"I will serve you, Dwarf-Lord!  I will be your slave!"<br/><br/>Romrama thinks it'll be cool to have a hobgoblin slave.  "I accept," he says, "but I won't treat you as bad as a slave."<br/><br/>"Thank you, Lord!" the hobgoblin cringes closer.  "Thank you!"  And then... as it gets even closer, Romrama <i>(failure) </i> suspects nothing.  The treacherous hob leaps up with a shriek to bury a dagger in the dwarf's chest!  It rolls 2d6 for damage and scores an 11!  After subtracting his Tough and Armor, Romrama is down to 5 HP, with the dagger still in him and the parapet pressing at his back!<br/><br/>Aha, I say in my best dramatic voice.  The hobgoblin pushes you, snarling in your face, spit spraying from its fanged mouth as it tries to twist the knife deeper and finish you.  Or push you to your death, 'cause it's not picky.  Romrama <i>(CON success)</i> manages to retain his grip on his axe despite the pain, and rears back to take a mighty swing.  The axe crashes into the hob's shoulder!  It hisses, "How I hates you dwarfy scum..." and expires.  He heaves the body over the wall.  There follows a distant crunch as it hits the stony ground below.  A disgusted Romrama pulls out the dagger and throws it aside.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rhavaniel emerges from her Dazed state to find herself at the base of the tower, arm twisted up behind her, a dagger at her throat.  A shaky voice growls in her ear, "Move, little elf scum.  Maybe you'll live, maybe you won't.  It's up to your friends."<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>Finale.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401030/#Comment_401030" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-16T22:06:51+00:00" title="December 16, 2012 10:06PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2012 3:15PM by Hexabolic.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the courtyard, Lostariel throws a dagger at the hobgoblin with the key, but<i> (partial failure)</i> only wounds him badly.  Screaming in pain and terror, he flees, leaving the key in the door.  But to the horror of the characters, there's another impact, and a loud clack as the lock jolts the rest of the way open.  The door begins to swing out!  Forgetting the escaping hobgoblin, Mist and Lostariel race to the door and throw themselves against it to prevent whatever is inside from escaping.  I use the success counting rules RobbMcDiarmid suggested above, and <i>(die of FATE)</i> determine the Troll is really strong and will require six successes to contain.  The kids roll 1 success between them, Mist with 1 and Lostariel with 0, but then spend a boatload of Awesome Points to get Lostariel up to 3 successes, still two shy.  The door begins to open, and I describe how Mist and Lostariel feel their boots slide over the rough stone of the courtyard.  Immense green fingers with long black nails wrap around the edge of the door.<br/><br/>JM remembers that Mist is now LUCKY!  She rerolls, gets a success, and throws more Awesome Points to boost it to a crit for 3 more successes.  I narrate how she uses the Sword of Tirendel to slash the knuckles of the green hand.  With a "Hooo," the fingers are pulled back, and there's a moment's opportunity where they can redouble their efforts and slam the door closed.  Mist, assisted by her gauntlets of DEX, quickly grabs the key and locks the door.  Everybody sighs in relief.<br/><br/>The last hobgoblin drags Rhavaniel out, trying to reach the keep.  He shouts for her companions to keep their distance or he'll kill the elf.  An outraged Romrama runs down the stairs, axe in hand.  The other players back off.  Rhavaniel bravely says in a small voice, "Don't listen to him.  Don't let him get away."<br/><br/>The hob passes the mysterious door with his hostage, and here is where Lostariel (success) has been hiding in the shadows.  She leaps out to Backstab him, but<i> (failure) </i>misses her deadly strike, as the outraged hobgoblin jerks Rhavaniel around, his dagger doing a few HP damage to her as a warning.  "Don't!" he cries.  "Don't touch me!"  Lostariel gets out of the way of his wild swing, but retreats until the hobgoblin resumes his trek.<br/><br/>When the hobgoblin has gotten halfway across the courtyard, Mist raises her elven sword and makes a threat: "Let her go or else."  The sword's baleful blue light <i>(partial success) </i>Causes Fear and the hobgoblin slashes wildly at Rhavaniel, doing lots of HP damage before he wheels and runs like a rabbit.  Romrama (failure) isn't fast enough to catch up and the hobgoblin reaches the door of the keep.  But Romrama asks if he can throw his axe.<br/><br/>Sure he can.  And he <i>(partial success)</i> nails the hobgoblin between the shoulder blades.  The hob makes the classic three more steps before collapsing.  Victory!  Though Romrama's axe head is cracked from all the heavy armor-cutting it's been doing.<br/><br/>"Can I buy a new one?" he asks, not too worried as he digests his lack of the traditional dwarven weapon.<br/><br/>"Yeah," I say.<br/><br/>"How far to the market from here?  Can we go now?"<br/><br/>"Not quite."<br/><br/>I remind them that Rhavaniel is below zero HP, which means she's dying.  Mist runs to heal her--actually she starts for Romrama first, since S has been saying she wants to die.  I mention that one of Mist's friends is *dying* and might need attention first.  Mist <i>(crit) </i>swiftly manages to stop the bleeding and hopefully save her companion.  Rhavaniel <i>(fails to Defy Death) </i>returns from the Gate of Death with 1HP and bearing the mark of Death in some fashion.<br/><br/>JM is psyched to have a magical mutation, but doesn't want it to be something she doesn't like, such as snakes for hair (one of the things I mention).  S is delighted she's been Dead, and proudly announces it to her sister (A, the Necromancer) and mom when they arrive to pick her up.  I caution them that the first mark or tell might be subtle, but repeated instances may result in things they don't like quite as much.  S leaves considering whether her eyes should now be dead black as her Death-mark, or milky white.  JM likes the idea of Amber's hair stirring perpetually as if blown by a phantom breeze.  C is happy to have axe-blasted a bunch of bad guys, and his gramma thanks me for "doing this for the kids."  I'm feeling good.  We'd started late, but got a good jolt of gaming in during the two hours, fifteen minutes we've been at it.<br/><br/>JM decides Amber's going to take it easy and use quicksilver more in future and not just run up the star.  She's further decided to focus on Amber for awhile and let Mist go into the background for the time being.  S will do the same with Lostariel.  Next session we'll be at one character apiece.  I feel like everyone got what they wanted this session--including me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401054/#Comment_401054" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T07:11:54+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  7:11AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Blake, do your girls interact with one another's games at all?

When we started Faery's Tale and World of Dungeons, it was Elder Moppet, Junior Moppet, A, and S.  That went OK, but the older girls had a different agenda than the younger ones. Also, JM has a distinctly narration-heavy style of describing her actions (though she's gotten more terse with experience) that triggered the older girls because it seemed to bog things down.  So right now the arrangement is that if we don't have an away playdate arranged for JM, she hangs back in the TV room and reads or draws or something.  If EM doesn't have a visit arranged elsewhere, she does her own thing.  At some point, I have a vision of an epic dungeon session with both groups and two DMs, maybe a climactic fight with a Big Bad.<br/><br/>Thanks, Paul.  I'm definitely learning how best to mesh rolls and the fiction.<br/><br/>Other house rules that are emerging:<br/><br/><b>SPIRIT TELLS. </b> If a wizard fills the five-point star on the character sheet from opening to the Otherworld as a summoning method (and maybe different types of mage play different versions of magical Hangman), he or she gains a <i>Spirit Tell</i>, a magical mutation or consequence.  Early tells are minor and relatively subtle, but if a mage keeps accumulating them, they become more drastic, even draconian.  If the process continues long enough, the magic user may  even become a spirit and could be removed from play. <i> (This last bit is ripped from BW's Magic Burner.)</i><br/><br/><b>SPIRIT LIKES. </b> Spirits have innate things they like based on their domains and how they're used in play.  For example, a Fire spirit commonly likes to burn things.  A spirit is predisposed to do something it likes, and willingly makes bargains toward that end.  If a spirit is summoned and successfully used for certain tasks often enough, it may gain a liking for that task, in which case it gets a extra die of effect bonus when asked to do that thing.  This is a way for longtime spirits to evolve both personality and distinctive spirit skills over time.  One of the reasons I like this is because if you use a spirit for negative tasks, like killing people, it starts to like doing that and will bend itself toward doing more, which could lead to interesting problems.  It sort of builds in karma for how you use your magic, and makes Necromancers even scarier depending on what they do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401083/#Comment_401083" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T12:26:33+00:00" title="December 17, 2012 12:26PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Amber could Command it, but she's decided she likes bargaining, and wonders if Commanding spirits is mean.</i><br/><br/>Yes!

Both groups immediately gravitated toward using them as a pool despite earning them and controlling them individually.  There's little to no hoarding, and everyone freely offers Awesome Points to each other.  I tried the fan mail bit, and I'm not sure that works as well with the younger crowd, since they just started handing over the fan mail chips as Awesome Points (which makes sense).  On the other hand, that's not really a problem.  We had plenty of hazard in both games, so it wasn't like the Awesome Points threw things off.<br/><br/>Without the Awesome Points, both games would likely be much more gritty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401118/#Comment_401118" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T16:55:43+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  4:55PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just can't get enough of these.

For instance, Andromeda's uber-Necromancer father appears to be the candidate for Dark Boss, and he was responsible for the death of Valavanora's character, while Arselan's paladin Order has the task of monitoring the daughter (Andromeda).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401980/#Comment_401980" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-28T18:08:11+00:00" title="December 28, 2012  6:08PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2012 6:12PM by Hexabolic.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, so I have another AP to post.

Two DG sessions to catch up on.<br/><br/><b>One:  Out of the Dungeon at Last!</b><br/><br/>When we last left the Dungeon Girls, they had just survived an ambush by the remaining cultists of Klaash'Tuu.  The players for Niff and Sklarah couldn't make it, so we had A, G, M, and Elder Moppet.<br/><br/>It is the middle of the night, and though most of them have come through and been healed, their friend and charge Nunk lies bleeding from a half dozen arrow wounds.  The group immediately starts stressing over him, expressing the hope he won't die.<br/><br/>Rolls by the cleric Lucius and by Arselan the Paladin <i>(partial successes) </i>stabilize Nunk but not enough to save him, just buy time.  After a quick discussion, they decide Arian the Ranger and her lion Hodori will race ahead to the inn and get help.  Meanwhile, the rest of the group will carry Nunk to the inn.<br/><br/>Arian <i>(partial success on Survival)</i> finds the way to the Inn successfully, though doing so takes her longer than anticipated because the city is pitch dark and its streets unfamiliar.  Once there, she <i>(partial success on a CHA roll)</i> discovers the innkeepers (it's a high class place) will certainly call for a doctor who lived nearby, but won't risk its people venturing deeper into the dangerous city at night.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Niff and Arselan attempt to carry Nunk to the inn, but <i>(failure on CON roll)</i> find out he is too heavy and everyone too wiped out to bear him much more than halfway.  Nunk lies in the street while the party catches its breath and tries to figure out how to get the big guy the rest of the way.<br/><br/>Valavanora decides to summon an air spirit to make Nunk lighter.  After some discussion, she <i>(crit!)</i> summons a spirit with the Domains Wind and Burdens.  It manifests as a cricket formed of softly shifting sand, and she decides its name is Bercalion, the Desert Breeze at the Back That Eases Burdens.  She doesn't have Command, so she bargains with it, helped by the critical success.  She appeals to its better nature, stressing how she wants to help a friend.  She <i>(critical CHA roll) </i>impresses the spirit with her kind heart, and it replies that it has been long since a human has called upon it to assist in an act of mercy.  Not only will it grant her petition to lighten the burden of Nunk, but it would be willing to travel with Valavanora as her ally if she would pact with it.  She agrees, and the spirit dissolves into a sandy breeze, and swirls up her forearm, its sand particles scratching a graceful spiraling mark of fine, pale lines upon her skin for 1HP to seal the agreement.  The marks glitter faintly under light.  Everyone is impressed, and Bercalion causes a breeze to blow that seems to make Nunk lighter and everyone refreshed enough to bear him all the way back to the inn.<br/><br/>At this point, the non-magic user members of the party are starting to feel like also-rans.  The mages are just SO COOL!  M and G look a little crestfallen.  I am sure the tide will turn when the group gets into a situation that leverages the talents of the others.  M asks if non-mages can get spirit powers.<br/><br/>I think about it a second and answer, "Sure.  You can't summon or command spirits, but if you meet one and can bargain with it, you can make a pact and gain powers.  Why not?"<br/><br/>She seems reassured.  I point out to G that Arselan could think of his goddess as a giant spirit he's already in a relationship with.  He needs to build that relationship.<br/><br/>I think they're reassured, anyway.<br/><br/>Back at the inn, the doctor arrives, Nunk is treated, there's a brief talk about what to do next, and after seeing Nunk tucked into a feather bed stained with blood and grime from his dirt-encrusted body (to the innkeeper's delight), the party finally sleeps.<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>SHOPPING! and the dark rituals of summoning</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403180/#Comment_403180" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-09T11:26:21+00:00" title="January  9, 2013 11:26AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is a <b>great</b> mechanic!

Now things were different, and the girls were eager to spend their hard-won silvers.<br/><br/>The first thing they decided on was horses for their trip.  They had some discussion about next steps and concluded after looking at the map that they wanted to head toward the Regency and the Druid Lands.  (I'll get around to posting a scan of the initial map. I have plans to do it up in more detail and style.)  G wanted to cross the inner sea toward Ankhyra, since Arselan's goddess Ceridwen was the Lady of Waters, and Andromeda wanted to go to Ankhyra as well, but the rest of the group argued for an overland route to the Regency.  After some back and forth, they voted for overland, but with the compromise that they would travel along the coast.<br/><br/>Hence the horses.  Everyone was quite specific about what they wanted, and spent some time detailing their horses' appearance.  I told Arselan he owned his own horse already, since he was a paladin, and a trained war horse at that.  This was sort of a gimme, but I thought it reasonable given how much leadership G had shown, and I was looking for ways to show how the non-mage characters were awesome.<br/><br/>So...the party proceeds to the bazaar, where they split up.  I let the horse purchase happen off-stage without a roll, since each of the subgroups had different agendas, and I wanted to focus on those.<br/><br/>Valavanora and Andromeda want fancy dresses, masterwork quality.  I name a price basically twenty times that of a standard dress, and they each buy one with a little haggling but no roll.  That meant Elder Moppet would (and did) spend a good deal of the session drawing and coloring her dress.  I suggest pearls sewn into the silk, and EM enthusiastically agrees.  A draws Andromeda's dress as well, which is much less flamboyant, as befits the necromancer daughter of one of the setting's big bads.  They ooh and ahh over how awesome their fancy dresses are, and how they'll be able to use them to make CHA rolls at special parties and court events.<br/><br/>M wants her ranger Arian to have a new bow, but a really good one.  She decides her Level 3 Special Ability will be <i>Volley</i> instead of <i>Wild</i>.  She really wants to talk to Hodori, but concludes that maximizing damage is more important at this stage.  She asks about a composite bow, and I name a price ten times that of the heaviest bow in the equipment list.  She <i>(success on CHA)</i> counterbids and gets the price lowered by over ten percent.  Done.  She happily describes her wood and horn bow, and I add some verbal filigree about decorative carving on the horn part so it has personality.  We have some discussion about how she would carry it on her person along with sword and spear and quiver and so on.<br/><br/>Haggling is fun.<br/><br/>Next up, Arian and Arselan go to an alchemist's shop to sell a few of the lightning guns taken from the skitterlings.  I make sure to describe the shop in some detail and introduce the shopkeeper as Kassai the Clever, Alchemist of the Fifth Star.  These could go for a decent price, but the group only agreed to sell a few of the guns, since they have more guns than charge vials.  After some haggling with Kassai, who points out that the guns alone are mere curiosities, but a working gun with a charge vial would command a much better price, they <i>(crit) </i>negotiate the sale of three guns and one half-full vial.  I use the success accumulation rules for this exchange.  Because of the crit, Kassai gives them a decent price and tells them to come to him first with such interesting things, as he would be their friend in future.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Andromeda and Valavanora go to an occult shop to purchase a special ritual dagger for Andromeda.  This does not go well, as the shopkeeper (failure on CHA) recognizes Andromeda as a necromancer and immediately ejects her from the shop, refusing service.<br/><br/>I should point out the girls have been using Awesome Points like crazy, so some of these successes and crits result from them throwing their points down to boost results.  When the points are plentiful, they don't give this decision much thought.  I expect them to be more parsimonious when they get thin.  As I may have said before, I've been using plastic crystals (MTG mana trackers) to denote Awesome Points, and the group seems to enjoy them.<br/><br/>Andromeda decides to summon a powerful spirit using ritual to empower one of her daggers into a magical item.  After proceeding to a necropolis in the city, she uses Ritual to create a special summoning circle and what I take to be a containment circle for the dark spirit she wants to summon.  She crits on the summoning roll (!) and gets a really powerful spirit whom she names Nagrasagiel the Judge.  I draw upon the sheaves of random crap I've printed off from various oracles and generators and decide Nagrasagiel is a chief servant of one of the Gods of the Dead.  So yeah, powerful as <i>hell</i>.<br/><br/>Valavanora is watching from a (hopefully) safe distance.<br/><br/>I describe how the scene goes gray, color drawing back from the area around the necromancer as the Judge manifests in the form of a gaunt man with pale skin and a stained gauze bandage over his eyes, clad in a ragged shroud with strips that ripple up around him in jagged patterns.  The paving stones of the necropolis bend beneath his feet.  I'm thinking a Brom moment here.  His domains are Strength and The Dead.<br/><br/>Negotiation commences.  What is Andromeda willing to give up for the pact?  This is a serious deal, as she describes what she wants for the dagger.  She wants it to damage wraiths and the undead, and to give her some ability to protect the party other than melee capability.  Truth be told, she doesn't have a super detailed picture of what she wants, but she's down for a cool story.  I love it, and we bargain back and forth as the rest of the players chime in.  Problem is, Nagrasagiel ain't no puny little spirit; he's a demigod.  His ask is for something big and permanent, like an inability to lie or to feel love and affection.  He says he'll grant power commensurate with what he takes.<br/><br/>A decides Andromeda isn't willing to give up love, as it turns out.  The players throw out suggestions and perch on the edge of their seats as A thinks about it.  Finally, Andromeda decides.<br/><br/>"My eye," she declares.  "I will give my eye."<br/><br/>I'm not rolling for this.  Come on.<br/><br/>"A fitting price for a judge," the spirit responds.  Andromeda feels a terrible pain in her left eye and it's gone, leaving only a shadowy eye socket.  The whole eye socket, mind you, like a freakin' skull.  Filled with inexplicable darkness.  The gray of the world around them retreats into the dagger, and Nagrasagiel points out that she can only use the dagger "to bring justice to the dead."<br/><br/>Andromeda slumps to her knees as the spirit departs, leaving the dagger glinting blackly in the sunlight.<br/><br/>The table is silent and appreciative for a moment, though A is beside herself with excitement.  She immediately begins erasing her character picture to make the adjustment and then draws her long black hair so it falls dramatically over the socket.<br/><br/>M says, "I can't believe you gave up your <i>eye</i>."<br/><br/>I'm a bit amused at how the girls aren't into their characters sporting facial scars, but tearing out a whole eye is awesome.  These girls are <i>badass</i>, fancy dresses and all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403405/#Comment_403405" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-10T23:53:14+00:00" title="January 10, 2013 11:53PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy sweet Moses!

She and all the DG have great taste in names.  Honestly, one thing about this game is that I'm pulling in a ton of extra resources: the Names book, free maps downloaded from the net, dollar dungeons, oracles, the Harrow Deck, a random D&amp;D treasure generator.  But the Names book is our go-to for all things name-related.  I've pushed John's WoD (WoDu) list from p.3 as well, and it's getting some traction, but all the kids think the Names book is the bomb.  I should just graft a bookmark on the Elvish lists, because all the girls go there first.  Maybe the Arthurian one as well.<br/><br/>One thing I should mention: we do all our rolling in a die tray, a wooden candle holder I found at Goodwill.  It's just a round, six-inch diameter, inch-deep tray, but it works great as a showcase for die rolls.  I use it in my 1492 Other Worlds game too.  It has the bonus of keeping dice on the table, esp. for the little ones. The Dungeon Kids have rolled outside the tray a few times, and the dice go all over the place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403523/#Comment_403523" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T21:41:48+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  9:41PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2013 9:43PM by Hexabolic.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here's the write-up of Thorn.  I did this, embellishing on A's description of what she wanted.  With this and another weapon coming up in the next write-ups, I started experimenting a bit, shamelessly ripping from the other awesome ideas folks are putting up in other threads.  A did name the dagger herself.<br/><br/><b>The dagger THORN</b> has four powers granted to it by the Judge Nagrasagiel.<br/><br/>1) It replaces one of the d6s the player normally uses. When wielded against the living or using it merely in self-defense, the player rolls a d4 (plus another d6) instead of 2d6. If it is used against the Dead with the intent of staying in the battle until the Dead are put to rest, the wielder rolls a d10. If it is wielded in a battle against Dead that are not put to rest (i.e., the wielder flees or the Dead escape), then the dagger user only rolls 2d4 with it until it is successfully used to put Dead to rest, at which time it resumes its former power. Its other powers will not function until it is \u201creconsecrated in judgment.\u201d<br/><br/>2) Thorn grows cold in the presence of Undead.<br/><br/>3) Thorn can strike any manner of Dead, Undead, or ghosts regardless of whether they are material.<br/><br/>4) When the wielder sacrifices 1 HP of damage and uses the Turn Special Ability, Thorn adds +2 to the roll. This HP may not be healed until the next new moon. If the wielder does not possess the Turn special ability, she may invoke Nagrasagiel and sacrifice 1d6 HP to gain the ability for one immediate use. These HP may not be healed until the next new moon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403590/#Comment_403590" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-13T01:29:58+00:00" title="January 13, 2013  1:29AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So amazing....

Its wonderful!<br/><br/>Are you still using Playmobil? How will Andromeda's avatar be modified?! Ooooh.<br/>Oh and maps? Yes Please!! I just got hold of a copy of Dyson's book and its gonna become the resource that comes to hand for any WoD dungeons we need, but I'd love to see your overland map.... How did it Evolve?

I'm so digging the experience.  The interesting thing about WoDu is how light it is, yet how substantial.  Unfortunately, I don't know how long I can keep up the intensive blogging now that I've started a new job.  I'm a couple of sessions behind as of today's Dungeon Kids throwdown.<br/><br/>We haven't been using Playmobil for character figures, but that's a great idea.  It's been more that when taking a break from WoDu play, the kids have gravitated to the Playmobil toys.<br/><br/>Dyson's book?  Am I missing something here?<br/><br/>The overland map came from an initial collaboration with Elder and Junior Moppet, using John's page 3 name atlas for the major regions.  I sketched out a coastline and placed mountains and rivers with input from the girls.  JM "inked" my penciled features and colored the Druid Lands' forest and the Great Waterhole.  As you might imagine, some of their input came with unexpected elements.  For example, JM told me the Islands are all connected with stone bridges which we determined are more like massive walls sunk into the water.  There's potential for the ruins of a huge undersea city there, but in the meantime, all the islands have foot and wagon commerce with each other, though sea trade would still be more economical.  Also, there's an inland sea or mighty lake in the Great Desert that JM calls "The Great Waterhole," so I imagine tons of animals come there to drink, maybe under some sort of spirit-enforced peace.  EM placed the Druid Lands between the Regency and the Northlands, and added some details about a huge waterfall coming off the eastern plateau.  They named some cities as well, drawing inspiration from <i>The Roman Mysteries</i>, a series I've been reading to them.<br/><br/>The Dungeon Girls didn't add to the map, but integrated it into their characters' backstories, so we discovered a little more about a few of the countries.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403639/#Comment_403639" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T00:15:16+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 12:15AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 12:15AM by Noofy.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playmobil for the win! <br/>Thanks for the info about the maps, I love the emergent details from the moppets - Stone Bridges?!

For this, I'd cribbed a ton of list material from Abulafia and strung it up with randomly generated villain concepts.  The centerpiece was "the Merchant of Maggots," an image of a foxlike woman clad in fine, yet threadbare garb.  I read through my list of stuff, checking off elements.<br/><br/>The players seemed excited by the "prophecy," and G wrote it all down.  There was stuff about a cliff of screaming monkeys, a golden armlet on the skeletal arm of its owner, a deadly assassin, a glowing skull holding the soul of a magician king, a raving prophet and soft-hearted shepherd.  If any of you have played In a Wicked Age, you know the sort of thing I'm talking about.  But for the girls, it was exciting and murky and ominous, exactly as intended.<br/><br/>OK, so prophecy in a high fantasy milieu is an overused trope, but it feel fresh to the Dungeon Girls.  What's cool about prophecy as game story delivery vector is that I can take the mosaic bits of imagery and weave them into the players' story as we go forward, connecting the bits of prophecy to the Fronts and Grim Portents.<br/><br/>Right.  So a weary Andromeda picks herself up, collects the newly empowered dagger Thorn, and she and Valavanora return to the inn.  There they meet the rest of the group and she shares her vision.  After some discussion, involving a lot of oohs and ahhs about the skeletal parts of the prophecy, they renew their resolve to travel toward the Druid Lands by way of the coast.  The next morning they set off with horses and a mule.  Nunk is too big to ride, so he's on foot but uncomplaining.  He's happy the girls are willing to feed his prodigious appetite.<br/><br/>Arian <i>(critical success)</i> leads them swiftly and safely through the desert for several days, having departed from the road for what looks like a more direct route through the desert and a range of hills toward the eastern end of the middle sea (name TBA).  In the hills, they arrive at a rise over a canyon.  There are the ruins of an old city there, pressed up against the base of the cliff.  They see greenery, indicating water.  And there appear to be lots of monkeys scampering up and down the cliff.  The party can hear their shrieks from here.<br/><br/>Several girls exclaim, "Monkeys..."  A little thrill of anticipation passes through the group.<br/><br/>In the distance, they make out gathering clouds that Arian <i>(success)</i> correctly recognizes as an approaching sandstorm.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> Ruins in the Sand</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403699/#Comment_403699" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T18:34:58+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  6:34PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 7:03PM by Hexabolic.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arian will scout the city to see if it's inhabited before the group seeks shelter there.  She and Hodari slip down to the sand-colored wall.  She finds a gap in the wall and enters to find a string of camels, a small oasis in the remnants of an ancient courtyard.  Someone says something in a guttural tongue.  A tower is still intact, and she crouches in the shadow of the courtyard wall to observe.  Rough-looking men in desert garb emerge from the tower to stand in the scant shade and give the camels some cursory attention.   A couple make their way toward another mostly intact building closer to the cliff.  Their speech is also rough, and Arian wonders if these guys are bandits.  She scouts a little closer, <i>(success)</i> managing to remain undetected as she peers into the darkened interior of the tower.  Around a dozen swarthy men sit around a small fire drinking what smells a little like coffee. She <i>(success)</i> sees the men are well-armed, but irregularly--everyone seems to have different gear, nothing standard, lots of weathered finery and patchwork robes.  There's also a couple of chests in there, and one guy is kicking a bag that jingles as if with coin.  The men laugh, but it's kind of a nasty laugh.<br/><br/>Arian decides they're bad guys and retreats to the inside of the wall, where she <i>(partial success)</i> looses an arrow bearing a red strip of cloth in a high, fluttering arc as the prearranged signal for the party: danger here.  Unfortunately, a bandit happens to look her way as she does this.  He shouts.  The alarm is raised!<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> Battle of the Sand Bandits!</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403700/#Comment_403700" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T18:38:18+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  6:38PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Meanwhile, and before the arrow comes up, Andromeda decides Arian has been taking too long, and she sneaks down the hill.  The others wait, but Valavanora prepares to follow.  Niff and Arselan stay back for now, out of sight behind the crest of the hill, but ready to charge in on horseback if necessary.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, M decides Arian needs to get the hell out of there.  Hodari snarls, which gives the first bandit pause, and Arian tells him to leap to the top of the wall.  He does so reluctantly, while she puts an arrow into the bandit before slinging her bow onto her back and climbing the wall.  At least, that's the plan.  Unfortunately, a handhold <i>(failure)</i> crumbles under her grip, sending her tumbling onto the sandy courtyard floor, stunning her.  Hodari roars and leaps down to stand over his friend as the bandits come running and draw up short when they see the...*cough* mightyferocious lion.<br/><br/>Their courage returns as some of them arrive with bows and spears.  While Arian groggily tries to regain her bearings, the bandits approach with death in their eyes.  They're not shooting arrows until everyone is braced with their spears.  Things look bad.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Andromeda has  <i>(success)</i> gotten inside the wall undetected, sliding from shadow to shadow and hiding in the sparse shrubbery and one of the few palm trees there.  She pulls a non-magical dagger which she  <i>(crit)</i> uses to cut a passing bandit's throat from behind.  Cue bloody arterial FX, I think, but A is ahead of me.  For the additional cool crit bit, she asks if she can direct the spray of blood to blind the bandit's companion momentarily.<br/><br/>Oh hellz yeah. +1 forward.  She  <i>(success)</i> knifes the poor blinded guy on the next round.<br/><br/>Back at the cornered lion, things look bad.  M is fretting Hodari will be hurt or killed.  As he gathers himself to spring, the bandits brace their spears and a few take aim with a mix of bows, javelins, and crossbows.<br/><br/>Valavanora, meanwhile, still approaching the wall, calls Koriander, who shows up in emerald flames.  Having learned her lesson from the fight in the alley of Shardeej, Valavanora tells Koriander to ignite all the <i>bandits'</i> weapons.  This the phoenix spirit  <i>(success)</i> accomplishes in her usual spectacular fashion, and the bandits' missile weapons and wooden-shafted weapons burst into flame.  So too do their metal weapons for a single round.  But as the wooden weapons burn, the metal ones don't.  Still, only a couple of bandits have the fortitude not to fling their swords and knives away.  Those that don't are Dazed from the pain of their burned hands.<br/><br/>Mind you, Koriander is swooshing through the courtyard, finding other weapons to burn.  Crude racks of spears and bundles of arrows all turn to kindling in a few seconds.  The effect roll is high enough to create a lot of chaos.  After a moment, the bandits start picking up their cooling swords as they try to regroup.  An enraged Hodari leaps into the midst of the ones threatening Arian.  Gruesome bitey-clawy carnage commences.  Andromeda <i>(success)</i> sticks another bandit in the confusion, but doesn't get an insta-kill.<br/><br/>Up on the hill, Arselan and Niff and Sklarah (remember, neither L nor F are here, so it's just G) spot reinforcements emerging from the other building, a half-dozen men racing for the courtyard.  G decides it's cavalry time.  She and Niff thunder down the hill, the paladin's warhorse swiftly taking the lead as he raises his sword in the name of his goddess.  Sklarah follows with the rest of the horses while Nunk lumbers in in their wake.<br/><br/>A bloody rout follows.  Arselan <i>(success)</i> immediately decapitates one of the reinforcements and rides down a second.  The extra d6 of damage I grant for being on horseback versus infantry isn't remotely needed.  NPC-for-the-day Niff takes out a guy himself, though with less panache.  By this time, Arian rolls up into a crouch and <i>(success)</i> feathers an attacker right between the eyes.  Valavanora arrives, bow at the ready, and picks off another.  Andromeda kills her man, but takes a nasty cut.  She flips back her hair to reveal her gaping eye socket, and <i>(CHA success)</i> intimidates the bejeezsus out of the five or six surviving bandits, who already aren't doing real well from a morale standpoint.  Abject surrender follows.  Arian calls Hodari off from his latest shrieking victim.  All is quiet except for the groans and whimpers of wounded and dying bandits.<br/><br/>But whoops, no time to celebrate.  Sandstorm!  The characters pool their ability rolls to get everything under cover in the tower, horses and all.  Arian and Valavanora roll Survival, Arselan Leadership, and they <i>(partial and full successes)</i> score <i>(die of Fate = 3)</i> more than three successes to get everyone in...except Nunk.<br/><br/>Pandemonium.  Everyone starts to volunteer to head out to find him, but Valavanora takes the initiative.  Andromeda holds a rope and makes her way out to the wall while Valavanora ventures out through the gap into the storm.  She <i>(crit bought with Awesome Points)</i> manages to clasp hands with Nunk before the storm renders everything utterly opaque.  They <i>(success on CON roll)</i> struggle back to safety, and everyone breathes a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>The session pretty much ends there.  We spend a few minutes handing out experience and loot.  Valavanora levels to 4th, which puts her in the lead of all the characters thus far.  I decided that since they didn't finish out the Temple of Klassh'Tuu, this would be a loot bonanza.  Besides, I wanted to try out some of the magical item rules different folks have posted here.<br/><br/>Valavanora takes a CON point for her Level bonus.<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>Abundant loot and a Thing of Power</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403701/#Comment_403701" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T18:42:39+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  6:42PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 7:06PM by Hexabolic.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As we go through the loot they find in the tower and in the outlying building, a few interesting items come to light:  There's a cool <i>+2 kite shield</i> painted with a winged serpent emblem that Arselan turns down because it's not his style.  There's a non-magical eyepatch embroidered with an eye in silver thread.  Andromeda claims a longsword with <i>Ghost Touch</i>.  A frog ring that grants a Great Jump skill three times a day goes to Arian.  Potions and scrolls go primarily to Sklarah, who also receives a gnarled staff that seems to be connected to summoning woodland spirits.  Once again I'm struck by how even-handed this group is. <br/><br/>Let me pause to point out that I find myself blocked at times thinking of interesting things to award.  For some reason, it's felt challenging for me to think up cool and interesting items.  I found a website <a href="http://www.myth-weavers.com/generate_treasure.php?do=treasure" rel="nofollow">here</a> that lets you generate random D&amp;D treasures, and what's actually really cool about it is how it produces detailed non-magical item "art" objects.  You have to hit refresh a bunch, but it's not bad as a starting point.<br/><br/>Anyway, the eyepatch was one of these <i>objets d'art,</i> and other gewgaws like opal-studded hand mirrors and silver leaf-pattern rings were a big hit with the group, purely for the fashion possibilities.  Any other group I've ever been in would have immediately assessed the value of this stuff for sale.  Not the Dungeon Girls.  They really appreciate these items.  But my goal is to come up with interesting stuff that feels unique and has a place in this world's history, not just "+1 sword."  I'm still figuring out the history details, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>The site also kicks out colors, smells, and tastes for the potions, which is fun when it comes to potion investigation.<br/><br/>Now, I'd been wanting to experiment.  There was a coffer in a chest, accompanied by a heavy shortsword in a finely-wrought sheath.  The hilt looked like it might be gold with a red leather grip.  However, the pommel was a single giant garnet carved in the shape of a human skull.<br/><br/>"I don't know," M says.  "A skull seems pretty evil to me."<br/><br/>A makes a noise about wanting it, but not too seriously.  She'd already gotten the ghost touch sword and is perfectly happy with Thorn.  EM is still coloring Valavanora's fancy dress.  F wasn't there to argue for Niff, and Arselan doesn't think the skull motif fits Arselan's faith.  They don't sense any obvious evil from the sword, though.  When Arian gingerly draws the sword partway from its sheath, she sees the blade is the same pale gold as the hilt, but what looks like twin serpents entwined with each other along each side of the blade. These are rendered in black enamel.<br/><br/>Ominous.  Nobody is terribly enthusiastic about this weapon.  But we have to table the rest for the next session.  Everyone seems satisfied with the encounter with the bandits, though.  Or maybe I should say satiated.  Victory brings with it a certain bonhomie.<br/><i><br/><b>Next: </b> Interlude on the notion of "playing right"</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403702/#Comment_403702" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T18:43:16+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  6:43PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is heinously miscategorized.

Sklarah is in Washington with her family, so the DG are still not at full strength.<br/><br/>While the other players were socializing among themselves G confided to me that she's struggling a little trying to find the right note for Arselan.  She said she sometimes feels like Arselan is the noble good guy in a party of these shifty, maybe-evil necromancers, druids, and mercenaries, and she's worried he wouldn't really stay with them.<br/><br/>I told her my first RPG character ever was a D&amp;D Paladin in a party that turned out to be riddled with chaotic to chaotic evil behavior.  Anyone who's ever played a paladin will recognize this quandary.  I frequently had to play my guy as gullible or unobservant just to rationalize staying with the party.   You could call that a basic expression of Author mode, I guess.  But I told G that Arselan could frame his dilemma in different ways to justify sticking around without compromising his moral stance.  She'd already established in tandem with A that Arselan's Order is responsible for containing the Big Bad Necromancer who is Andromeda's father.  Also, his Chapter in particular had been tasked with monitoring Andromeda herself, the necromancer's daughter known only as the Black Rose.<br/><br/>So Arselan staying with the group to keep an eye and possibly a sword on Andromeda was a good thing.  G seemed happy with that.<br/><br/>I'm struck by how the girls want to "play right."  I'm trying to convey a vision of play that isn't about "getting it right" but about "bringing the awesome."  Sure, there's some social contract pieces, and these include certain agreements that make the shared fiction seem plausible and therefore lend weight to the imagined space.  But it's not about right or wrong.  The writer in me wants to tell them to beat up their characters as much as possible and run them through a series of horrific wringers, because that's how you test your character and grow the depth.<br/><br/>But I think they get that on an intuitive level.  Each cool scar and death mark and spirit mark and so on makes their characters deeper and more interesting in a wabi-sabi manner.  I haven't been able to mess with them much yet outside of tactical engagements, but as their backgrounds come more into focus, that'll happen.  As I've mentioned, they have given me so much rich seed material, I can't wait to water it and see what grows.<br/><br/>My God, their backstories are full of flags...!<br/><br/>EM made the cautious comment to me after the session that she's "sort of more interested in our stories than in the Firejewel quest thing" I'd tossed out at the outset.  Music to my ears.  I'm sketching out some Fronts and Threats based on the background material the girls have put together.  I will work the Firejewels in, but they won't be the heart of the quest.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> The sword called Scourge -or- The Joy of Recycling Old Campaign Features</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403704/#Comment_403704" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T18:57:36+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  6:57PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 9:05PM by Hexabolic.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As we start this session, all these flag concepts are whirling around in my head: fancy dresses, horses with flowing manes, pets, orphan backstories, spirit marks, fighting a giant monster in the wilderness, cool scars, visiting the lands of the characters' childhoods, confronting Andromeda's evil big bad father...whew.<br/><br/>They're going to need some firepower.  Some of this the mages are building as they bind new spirits.  But it's time for me to see what happens when I drop in something really powerful.  I'm curious as to how the Dungeon Girls (&amp; Niff) will react.  Plus I want to test out some rules variations, push the boundaries a bit.<br/><br/>So I built <b><i>Scourge.</i></b>  Scourge was a magic sword I'd made when I was DM-ing D&amp;D back in my high school days, when my peers and I roamed the primal pre-Internet earth with sabertooth tigers, mammoths, and 8-track tape players.  The new iteration of Scourge looked about the same, if only to keep me from trying to keep Gene Wilder separate from Johnny Depp in my mind's eye.  The original was built as a Stormbringer-style weapon that wanted to drive its owner toward mayhem and drinking blood, but I decided I wanted the reboot to be more targeted in its semi-antagonism.<br/><br/>But I wanted it to be <i>powerful,</i> more so than the original.  I wanted it to be the kind of item you wanted to wield, but also made you wary because it could bite you in the face if you were careless.  The brilliant <i>Soulbrand</i> sword write-up done on the World of Dungeons Resource Compilation thread offered a good starting point. (Apologies for the lack of attribution, but I'm too lazy to go look up the post.  But it was fantastic.)<br/><br/>I was curious as to who would go for the sword.  Because of the weapon's nature, the wielder would have to be Arselan, Niff, or Arian.  Scourge, you see, was forged to be a mage-killer.  I have some faux history to flesh out, but in the past, there was some kind of Wizard War that resulted in a massive effort to take down a huge order or alliance of magic users.  I don't know why; maybe the wizards were tyrannizing the spirits, maybe there was some dark big-bad who built a dark bad empire with lots of orcses, maybe well-meaning magic users opened up a Pandora's Box that could only be closed with wizardly blood.  But Scourge would be an artifact of that war, forged and fated to kill magic users.<br/><br/>Here's what I came up with.  I kept the write up to a page, typed it up, and got it ready as a handout.  Feedback welcome, as always.<br/><br/><b>SCOURGE</b><br/><i>DESCRIPTION</i><br/>Heavy Masterwork short sword of pale gold metal (orichalcum) with black serpents intertwined on the blade, a pommel of garnet worked in the form of a skull.  Deals 2d6+STR damage, unbreakable by normal means.<br/><br/><i>POWERS</i><br/>1) FATED WEAPON<br/>When a new owner picks up Scourge, you take a scarlet d6 and set it to \u201c1\u201d. Anytime you roll the dice while wielding Scourge, you can swap the scarlet die\u2019s current value for one of your dice (and that die\u2019s value becomes Scourge\u2019s new value).<br/><br/>So if I roll a 4 and a 5 and get 9, I may want to downgrade to a 1 and a 5 and rely on my stat to pass the check (or my skill to keep from failing on a 6-). So you have to suffer a few setbacks to power Scourge up, but then you\u2019ll have a 5 or 6 stored in the sword, waiting for a crucial roll to use it.<br/><br/>When the player is using Scourge to confront evil magic users and creatures of magic, use Scourge\u2019s die value for the die of fate for things related to the wielder without swapping it!<br/><br/>2) DEADLY.<br/>When wielding Scourge, any 6\u2019s rolled to hit for for damage with the sword \u201cexplode,\u201d meaning you keep the six and reroll that die, adding the result to your total. If you swap the six out per FATED WEAPON, you do not reroll at that time, but may reroll at the time you swap in that six.<br/><br/>3) MAGE KILLER. <br/>Deals +1 damage to any character who has a Special Ability from the Wizard class. When Scourge successfully deals the death-blow to a magic user, take +1 forward with the weapon until the next die swap per FATED WEAPON, above.<br/><br/>4) AWAKENED SPIRIT.<br/>Unlike most magical items, Scourge has an active, intelligent spirit inside. This spirit has its own agenda and possesses its own Will which it can use to influence the wielder toward its ends. It grants the skill <i>Wizard Lore</i> to the wielder, which is Lore about wizards. Scourge does not communicate via telepathy or words, but by changes in the blade\u2019s physical state (i.e., temperature, light, weight, etc.). It can also influence the wielder\u2019s body if the wielder does not remain vigilant and firm of will (WIS rolls to determine).<br/><br/><i>Instincts for the Spirit:</i><br/>\t\u2726\tslay evil magic users or magic users who commit \u201cevil\u201d by the spirit\u2019s standards<br/>\t\u2726\tslay magical monsters<br/>\t\u2726\tnot retreat when faced with either of the above<br/><br/>5) WITCH FINDER.<br/>Scourge grants the wielder the skill <i>Sense Magic User,</i> which it communicates wordlessly via a physical change in the sword (i.e., temperature, light, weight, etc.).<br/><br/>So yeah, Scourge might turn out to be ridiculously powerful in actual play, but it's also a testbed for fiddling with variations to WoDu mechanics.  I figure the wielder will be plagued in the fiction by the sword's Awakened Spirit and its own goals via regular mental/emotional rolls.  But as I read over this, I'm thinking +1 damage to wizard types may be minor compared to the exploding 6 power.  If that turns out to be underpowered, I may make that a +1d6 down the line, maybe when the wielder levels up.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if Scourge turns out to be a vorpal reaper engine of destruction, I'll make the sword's spirit that much more willful and unrelenting.  Fun will be had either way.<br/><br/>Arian had possession of Scourge when the session started, Niff not having been there last time, and G rejecting the blade as another "not paladiny" flavored weapon.  I pointed out that Arselan wasn't picking up any signs of evil from it (his goddess wasn't warning him), but G wasn't budging.  Skull pommel, she figured, meant bad juju.<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>The Bonding of Scourge</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403705/#Comment_403705" name="Item_178" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T19:02:46+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  7:02PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 7:09PM by Hexabolic.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Matthew.

It can also influence or even control the wielder\u2019s body if the wielder does not remain vigilant and firm of will (WIS rolls to determine).<br/><br/><i>Instincts for the Spirit:</i><br/>- slay evil magic users or magic users who commit \u201cevil\u201d by the spirit\u2019s standards, esp. any remaining servants of the evil undead wizards once known as the Ashen Kings<br/>- slay magical monsters<br/>- not retreat when faced with either of the above<br/>- torment its wielder if he or she does not follow the sword\u2019s fated purpose<br/>- slay whatever hinders it from destroying the servants of the <del>Dust</del> Ashen Kings\u2014or the <del>Dust</del> Ashen Kings themselves, if any survive<br/>- do not tolerate the wielder using other weapons to accomplish Scourge's fated purpose<br/><br/><i>6) WITCH FINDER</i><br/>Scourge grants the wielder the skill Sense Magic User, which it communicates wordlessly via a physical change in the sword (i.e., temperature, light, weight, etc.).<br/><br/><i>7) BANISHER</i><br/>When Scourge does damage to a magician, the wielder may change a stored 6 per FATED WEAPON to a \u20181\u2019 in order to sever a Spirit Mark on the wounded magic user and break that mark\u2019s pact or bond with the allied spirit. The magic user cannot summon that spirit again for a year and a day.<br/><br/><i>8) SPIRIT-SHUNNED</i><br/>Most spirits do not care for Scourge, considering it arrogant and destructive.  They tend to treat the wielder with caution or even dislike.  However, spirits of justice, vengeance, or war may be more friendly.<br/><br/><b>HISTORY</b><br/>Scourge was a weapon forged for use in the struggle against the Ashen Kings, powerful Undead wizard-tyrants who dominated the southern lands hundreds of years ago. In the course of this long war, the sword changed hands many times, but was said to have been wielded at the siege of the Stained City of Durga\u2019alos where it struck down the hideous Ireshkanri, Queen of Maggots, one of the last and most powerful Ashen Kings. With her fall, the other Kings fled. Many were hunted down and slain in later years, but the fates of three were never ascertained.<br/><br/>When last noted in the scrolls of history, Scourge had been carried into the deep desert by its last known wielder, an eastern barbarian named Nathor, neither to be written of again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403974/#Comment_403974" name="Item_185" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T07:27:13+00:00" title="January 18, 2013  7:27AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice catch, philaros.

Sklarah isn't here since L is still unavailable.  M is struggling over Arian's decision whether to bond with Scourge.  Meanwhile, I describe how Sklarah (whose player isn't here) backs away with a nervous expression as Arian shows the sword to the party.  The wizard <i>(Die of Fate = 4)</i> knows a little about the sword, but not the details of its history.  What she does know is that it is a powerful weapon made to kill wizards, used in the ancient wars against the Ashen Kings.  She relates how tales of Scourge were told to frighten apprentices into sticking to the Path of Light.  Despite her anxiety, she acknowledges the sword isn't said to be evil itself.<br/><br/>M files that away with an evident mixture of trepidation and excitement.  The party splits up the rest of the loot, which includes a mysterious silver-ornamented coffer.  Niff (F is here today) <i>(success)</i> easily picks the lock, to reveal a softly glowing pink crystal.  The girls immediately break into a clamor of who might get it, but the conclusion that emerges is that pink doesn't work for Andromeda or Niff, and Arselan isn't too thrilled with it either.  Arian says she has the sword and doesn't need anything else.  It comes down to either Valavanora or Sklarah, but EM is here, and she hasn't taken much lately, so the crystal falls to her.<br/><br/>Various Lore rolls happen.  Valavanora <i>(crit)</i> recognizes the crystal as an <b>Ioun Stone,</b> its pink color indicating its virtue is to fortify the user's CON.  When keyed by the owner naming the sigil etched in the stone's heart, it will glow bright pink and swoop in orbit around the user.  When the owner speaks the sigil of rest, it will gently settle into the user's outstretched hand.<br/><br/>EM shrugs.  "Cool."  The Ioun Stone vanishes into Valavanora's belt pouch.<br/><br/>M decides Arian will bond with Scourge, though she continues to feel some trepidation.  Via Sklarah as a mouthpiece, I tell her major artifacts work a lot like pacting or bonding with spirits, since the Big Things typically hold Awakened Spirits that only grant their full power via pacting.  The implications of the skull pommel symbolism is what seems to be throwing her off, but at the same time, it's clear she's intrigued.  F makes a few quiet comments indicating his interest, but doesn't press the issue.  It's clear Arian is the one in possession.<br/><br/>The party is a bit nervous about this process, so Andromeda uses her Ritual skill to construct a Prison circle for Scourge and Arian.  It's questionable whether a Necromantic circle would work for long against a non-necromantic spirit, but I allow the attempt.  If there's a problem, I'll handle it via fictional positioning.  So the circle is scribed in an area of the courtyard swept clean of sand by Valavanora's cricket wind spirit, which she summons the long way.  This isn't stressful, so I don't bother requiring EM to roll.<br/><br/>The bonding goes well.  Arian <i>(success on WIS)</i> carefully cuts herself on Scourge's blade and lets a few drops of blood fall onto the enameled serpent heads near the tip of the blade.  The sword seems to warm in her hand.  The garnet skull begins to glow like a coal, and the ranger feels the spirit's presence.  Her fingers curl around the hilt without her conscious volition, and she feels her arm rise, the sword pointing in Sklarah's direction.<br/><br/>"No," Arian says, alarmed.  "She's my friend.  All the magic users here are my friends.  They're not evil!"<br/><br/>The sword becomes suddenly icy to the touch.  After a moment of silent struggle, she <i>(success on WIS)</i> is able to lower her arm and loosen her grip.  She feels a sudden, hot pain in her hand, then the sword's temperature returns to normal, neither warm nor cold.  The skull pommel's glow fades, but the back of her sword hand now bears a small brand in the shape of a human skull.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b>  The Merchant of Maggots!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404082/#Comment_404082" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-19T21:53:22+00:00" title="January 19, 2013  9:53PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, just wow!

Monkeys are clever, agile, and dextrous.  Monkeys ride well on your shoulder.  Monkeys are cute, too.<br/><br/>And this is all relevant how?<br/><br/>See, from the beginning of Dungeon Girls, the kids in both groups have been interested in acquiring <b><i>Pets</i></b>.  I've fielded questions about everything from spiders and snakes to dragonets and perspicacious lorises; pets seem to be a big draw for the players.  In fact, I'm working up a mini character sheet for pets, since we've got three of them between the two groups.  Honestly, the pet obsession has been one of the bigger surprises for me as we started this game.<br/><br/>But there were monkeys at this bandit spot.  Remember the cliff?<br/><br/>Niff decides he'd like to tame a monkey.  The table falls into a discussion of how to lure a monkey down, and what age the monkey should be, etc.  F wants a young monkey that can be trained, an intelligent one.  A cracks a joke about how he needs to avoid being saddled with an old, dumb specimen.  They debate about traps and bait and such, until M points out that Valavanora can just talk to them using her Wild special ability.  Everyone quickly agrees this is the way to go.<br/><br/>And this is all happening concurrently with M having Arian anguish about Scourge, so there was heavy drama struggling to unfold alongside monkey chatter, in essence.  Table management with this crowd is sometimes a challenge.<br/><br/>So Valavanora <i>(partial success on CHA)</i> talks to the monkeys and, acting as an intermediate for Niff, <i>(success on WIS)</i> eventually persuades a young, intelligent-looking monkey to come down and join the group.  The deal is for fruit and snacks.  Snacks are taken from the bandits' rations to pay off the monkey troupe.  The initial offer of food with the partial success had gotten a huge response, with all the monkeys volunteering to join.  The second roll noticed the young smart monkey sitting back and pitched the offer to him.<br/><br/>So the monkey joins the group.  As it happens, Junior Moppet is hanging out at home today by herself, and I've been feeling like I haven't spent as much time with her what with the new job, so I ask if she wants to play the monkey.  She says yes and joins the table.  I scribble down some monkey stats on a 3x5 card and we're off to the races.<br/><br/>Generally, I try to keep my daughters separated in these groups, so each can enjoy time with their peers without big or little sister energy.  Today my inner Dad yielded to include JM.  It was kind of an experiment, not a horrible one, but it confirmed that separation of the age groups is the best arrangement for now.<br/><br/>JM being the dynamic player she is, you see, regarded the monkey as a Heroic Monkey.  A protagonist rather than a supporting character.<br/><br/>This intention, while not a bad idea, would clash with the conception of a cute, occasionally useful monkey pet held by the rest of the group, as we'll see.  JM is whip-smart, creative, and damned good at heroics.  The monkey would be a source of cognitive dissonance going forward, as it threatened to overshadow the rest of the group.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b>\xa0 The Merchant of Maggots for reals!

Arian <i>(success)</i> leads the group to an oasis after an uneventful three day journey.  I have in mind there'd be an encounter, and I draw a Harrow card.  It turns out to be The Wanderer, which depicts a Centaur tinker/merchant image.<br/><br/>The party discovers a tent, a small wagon, and a mule team.  All these turn out to be owned by an itinerant merchant who is at first suspicious, but soon warms up after the characters show they meant no harm.  The presence of the paladin <i>(CHA Leadership success)</i> goes a long way to reassuring him.<br/><br/>I don't remember the guy's name, but he was from the Regency and so had a name from that list.  No, he wasn't a centaur, though I was tempted.  I decided not to interpret the card too literally in this case.<br/><br/>He sets down his spear and explains he is a wandering merchant who does business with the nomads who roam the Great Desert.  The players immediately ask me if he has (a) interesting pets, or (b) cool magical items.  Die of Fate is noncommittal, and I say, no, he's a dealer in trinkets, spices, glassware, and jewelry.  The party is interested anyway, so they pick through his stuff and haggle a little, trying to sell off some of their objects of art.  It quickly becomes evident the party's loot is rich beyond this guy's means.  The characters set up their tents and settle in for the night.<br/><br/>I encourage some in-character RP around the campfire.  The kids have been talking about sharing their backstories among the characters, and this moment seems tailor-made for doing so.<br/><br/>It is pretty cute, honestly.  They take turns around the table to tell their stories, a little haltingly, most of them a bit self-conscious as they try to find their characters' voices.  A finds her footing pretty quickly, EM and M come off a bit more wobbly but have a lot to say.  G portrays Arselan as curt and direct, but confident.  F remains curt and mysterious, in part because he hasn't had a chance to develop Niff's backstory yet.<br/><br/>"Eek, eek," says Junior Moppet after the others finish.  "I'm a monkey."<br/><br/>There follows a more strategic discussion of goals and destinations.  They are curious about the Merchant of Maggots from Andromeda's prophetic vision--the name has clearly caught their imaginations.  The wandering merchant says he's heard something of the Merchant of Maggots.  Evidently, she is a slave dealer and (rumor has it) something of a sorcerer as well.<br/><br/>When we made the map a few weeks ago, the moppets and I had established a town called <b>Vespa</b> (named after a slave ship from <i>The Roman Mysteries</i> book series) famed for its a notorious slave market.  Some characters now think Vespa might be a worthwhile destination, but the consensus is to stick to the goal of the Druid Lands.  They wonder how to find out more about the Merchant of Maggots, and this discussion spins out awhile without going anywhere.<br/><br/>Then the monkey offers a suggestion through Valavanora, a simple idea that cause the other kids to pause and say, "Huh.  Yeah.  That'd work."  I don't remember the suggestion now, but it was definitely one of those odd moments when everyone realizes JM is been paying attention.<br/><br/>Someone murmurs, "Smart monkey."<br/><br/>So they go to sleep, setting a watch.  Soon, however, they are all asleep, sharing the same dream.  In this dream, they're asleep in their camp under the desert stars.  A shadowy figures slips into their midst, going from tent to tent, eventually looming over Arian and Hodari, who remain fast asleep.  A gnarled hand reaches for Scourge--<br/><br/>Arian (success on WIS) jolts awake, Scourge so cold in her grip, it practically burns.  She struggles out of her blankets and finds the camp empty, with everyone asleep, the fire having died down.  Die of Fate makes the watch person Sklarah (for what it's worth).  This is a nice group.  No one rags on Sklarah, though I suspect if it had been Andromeda or Niff on watch, we'd have had an outbreak of snark.  Everyone seems to accept the mysterious figures was the Merchant of Maggots, and that the dream itself was magical.<br/><br/>But they're awake, and share notes.  In a few moments, I call for Awareness or WIS rolls.  There's enough success around the table, and I go from low to high with perception results, so that the high roll hears everything everyone else did, but gets an additional snippet of information.  The sandy scratchy, clicky noise indicates something huge is sort of slithering, sort of skittering to camp.<br/><br/>"Ooh!" JM cries.  "Purple worm!  Is it a purple worm, Daddy?"<br/><br/>Dammit.  The kid knows how I think.<br/><br/>"It's probably not a purple worm," I answer.  "It's probably the desert version of the species."<br/><br/>"Shai-hulud," A suggests.<br/><br/>This comment draws blank looks around the table.<br/><br/>"Sandworm," she clarifies, still not eliciting understanding from her friends.<br/><br/>"Desert worm!" I exclaim.  "And it's dark except for starlight.  What are you going to do?"<br/><br/>Everyone looks at each other.<br/><br/>"Umm\u2026light torches?" says M.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> Night Worm Fight!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Herman_Duyker" title="Herman_Duyker"><img alt="Herman_Duyker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.starstonedesign.com/mt/img/stealth.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Herman_Duyker">Herman_Duyker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404280/#Comment_404280" name="Item_192" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-22T14:45:06+00:00" title="January 22, 2013  2:45PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love your write-ups.

A says.<br/><br/>"I scamper over and grab a kitchen knife from the campfire," says JM in the part of the monkey.\xa0 "I hold it with my tail."<br/><br/>There's a pause.<br/><br/>"I don't know," says M.\xa0 "I think\u2026"<br/><br/>F nods.\xa0 "I don't see a monkey doing that."<br/><br/>"Not too realistic," EM tells JM with a little of that big sister tone.<br/><br/>G cuts in, "We need to find a weak spot."<br/><br/>EM is thinking.\xa0 "Daddy, can my spirit Mir use its Secrets power to find a weak spot?"<br/><br/>Why not?\xa0 Sure.\xa0 We haven't seen Mir yet.<br/><br/>So Valavanora takes a dose of quicksilver and summons Mir, her spirit with domains of Water and Secrets.\xa0 Mir manifests, by EM's description, as a misty blue sprite like the ones in <i>Brave</i>.\xa0 Valavanora asks for the secret of the worm's weak spot, and Mir <i>(success)</i> shares the knowledge with the party of a scabbed over spot about a yard wide on <i>(die of FATE for location)</i> the left-hand side of the worm, near the head.<br/><br/>The party spreads out, hashing out a rough strategy.\xa0 Niff and Arian stay in the middle, near the camp, from where they will shoot arrows at the worm.\xa0 Andromeda and Arselan flank to the worm's left, hoping to hit the weak spot.\xa0 Sklarah stays back too (NPC), and I figure I'll use her for a magic effect if necessary to help out if things go pear-shaped.<br/><br/>"That's where the monkey goes, too," declares JM.\xa0 "With the kitchen knife in my tail."<br/><br/>F and G exchange a look.  M says, "I don't know about that.  A monkey fighting a giant worm?"<br/><br/>"It's a brave monkey," JM insists.<br/><br/>The players shrug and conclude their maneuvering.  Valavanora flanks to the worm's right, from where she plans to wield her bow and may call on her standby fire spirit Koriander.<br/><br/>We have time left in the session for a round of arrows <i>(successes)</i> and the monkey scampers up to <i>(critical)</i> whack at the worm's weak spot with the kitchen knife.\xa0 The older players roll their eyes and EM sighs, but I allow the monkey to do an HP of damage anyway.  There's not much time left.  M's mom has arrived for pickup, so we move to wrap up.<br/><br/>The consensus seems to be that a PC monkey was over the top, and the kids were pretty direct, though not unkind.  They like JM, but the monkey business was breaking their -- for want of a better word -- immersion in the game.  Too jarring.  It wasn't helping that with JM at the helm, the monkey was shaping up to be freakin' <i>awesome</i>.<br/><br/>JM, to her credit, took no offense.  She's cool with staying out of Dungeon Girl business unless there's an epic Dungeon Kids crossover at some point in the future.<br/><br/>We left it on one final ominous note: the worm seems to fixate on Arian, its head tracking her movements as it lumbers forward.

A full house.<br/><br/>After some time for the kids to play on their own and vent some energy, we gather around the table, naturally arranging themselves with girls on one side, boys on the other.  <br/><br/>Last time on Dungeon Kids, they had defeated the hobgoblin garrison, kept the thing in the chapel contained, and brought the ranger Rhavaniel back from death.  Now...the citadel's courtyard is littered with hobgoblin bodies.  It is still dark, not yet dawn.  The mountain air is chill.  The stars gleam like ice crystals overhead.<br/><br/>"What do you do?" I ask.  I'm about to offer suggestions of possible avenues for action and exploration, but J calls out, "Loot the bodies!"  The other players take up the cry, and so everyone gets to roll against WIS to see what they find, dividing up the roughly dozen bodies evenly.  Everyone succeeds except Ingor, who rolls a partial success.  They all find a few silvers on the bodies, but as Ingor stoops to search his third corpse, the hobgoblin twists up, snarling, a dagger in its hand!<br/><br/>Ingor <i>(partial success)</i> leaps back and avoids the hobgoblin's thrust, but loses his footing on a slippery patch of flagstone.  As he goes down, the hobgoblin hauls itself to its feet.  Its fur is clotted with blood, and its hateful glare shows neither fear nor mercy.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the other members of the party are reacting.  Die of Fate rolls for each put most of them far enough away that they can't get there for one or two rounds.  Rhavaniel will need a round to pull out her bow.  Mist is too far away for a dagger throw and turns out to be the farthest away.<br/><br/>The hobgoblin raises its bloody muzzle to the night sky and screams out what Ingor and Amber <i>(success)</i> can tell is a prayer-curse to the hobgoblin's gods.  It begs for those dark powers to bring vengeance upon the slayers of its kin!<br/><br/>J asks if he can throw a dagger at it.  "Sure," I say.<br/><br/>"Can I throw my axe?" asks C for Romrama.  Yep, he can.<br/><br/>They both roll.  Ingor <i>(crit!)</i> hucks his dagger straight into the creature's throat, and Romrama's axe <i>(success)</i> also strikes true.  The hobgoblin goes down in mid-scream, deader than a doornail.  The boys bump fists.  First blood!<br/><br/>They're reckoning up their thin gleanings from the hobgoblins when the door to the chapel shudders under a heavy blow from the thing inside.  Everyone pauses.<br/><br/>"I bet that's the curse," S says.<br/><br/>JM nods.  "Yep, it's gonna get out."<br/><br/>"What is it?" asks Ingor, who missed the last session.<br/><br/>"We don't know," S says.  "But it's bad."<br/><br/>"We barely kept it in last time," JM adds.<br/><br/>The door shudders again from another blow, and wood cracks.  "HOO," says the thing. <br/><br/>The party scrambles to take up defensive positions.  The suspense is palpable, but the girls seem more curious.  The boys are trying to sort out which weapon they want to use.  JM tells C he should use the wolf-head maul they'd captured from the bugbear captain.  At first, he's not sure, because it's a two-handed weapon, and Romrama loves his shield protection, but the girls talk it up as so cool-looking that he relents.  Mist positions her sunstone for light.<br/><br/>The dwarf takes up a position well off to the side of the splintering door, while the others array themselves facing the door from a reasonable distance, missile weapons at the ready.  Mist takes up her elven sword and stands guard in front of Amber.<br/><br/>A few more blows and "HOOs," and the door's hinges finally give up.  The door is smashed outward, the thick boards broken.  From the darkened interior of the chapel emerges a filthy greenish figure with a long nose and long, lank hair. It steps out on splay-toed feet, then straightens a little to tower over them in a stoop-shouldered posture, its arms long enough that its taloned fingers drape almost to the flagstones.  And it has a carrion smell.<br/><br/>"Ooh, ooh," JM calls, fidgeting.  "Is it a troll, Daddy?  Is it?"<br/><br/>Make a Lore roll, kid.<br/><br/>Amber <i>(success)</i> recognizes the monster as a troll, and I hand over the <b>Monsters</b> book to JM, who takes it and flips straight to the troll entry, which she proceeds to read aloud to the rest of the group.  What stands out for them is that trolls are stupid and hungry, so throw food at them to delay them; they regenerate any damage not caused by fire or acid; and the females are larger and more powerful than the males.  This last attribute turns out to be an important one for the group.<br/><br/>JM pleads, "Can this be a girl troll, Daddy?  Pleeeease?"<br/><br/>The other kids shrug.  S decides to back JM's request.  Girl power!<br/><br/>OK, I say.  As fate would have it, this thing <i>is</i> a troll-hag with a ragged shift offering an attempt at modesty.  What do you know?<br/><br/>I bump the HP up ten points to 50.  Honestly, I don't know if the kids can take this thing, but they've surprised me so many times, I'm willing to push the boundaries a little.  There's a good possibility I'm going to beat up on them pretty hard this session.  Aside from 50 HP, the troll regenerates Die of Fate HP per round and it has Armor 1.  Those black, grimy talons do 2d6 damage.  The troll's qualities are Fiendishly Strong, Tireless, Ravenous.  Its Instincts are Eat the Living, Tear Stuff Apart to Get at the Chewy Center, and Feel No Pain.<br/><br/>This is going to be a throwdown.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> The Rumble with Rations!</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404524/#Comment_404524" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T08:34:05+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  8:34AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!

In that context, the "Feel No Pain" as an Instinct is more about if it does feel pain, it tries to stop or evade the source.  Think of "Feel" as an imperative.  That may mean fleeing from or destroying the source of pain, depending on circumstances.  Certainly it'll go after whatever just hurt it most recently.

The troll-hag sniffs the air, says "HOO!" and peers at Ingor and Lostariel with beady eyes.  Its mouth splits into a hideous grin and it starts toward them, arms extended.<br/><br/>I tell JM Amber has heard trolls like the taste of elves better than anything else in the world.  "Oh no!" says Ingor.  S smiles.  She clearly likes this idea.<br/><br/>"Mist throws some rations at it!" shouts JM.<br/><br/>Indeed, Mist <i>(success)</i> bounces a ration pack off the troll's forehead.  Brow furrowed, the troll looks down and clumsily snatches up the rations and shoves them, wrappers and all, into her snaggletoothed maw.  I pantomime exaggerated chewing as the troll is successfully distracted this round.<br/><br/>Rhavaniel <i>(crit)</i> puts an arrow into the troll's eye, bypassing armor and doing 8 damage.  The troll looks up, frowning, then reaches up to pull out the painful arrow.  I make icky sound effects and pantomime that as well.  This elicits a chorus of "Eww!" from the kids.<br/><br/>Using a fresh bowstring on his bow, Ingor shoots an arrow that <i>(partial success)</i> hits the troll in the shoulder for 3 HP, doing 2 after armor.  Unfortunately, it draws her attention back to the tasty elf meat waiting for her.<br/><br/>"HOO!"  She resumes her advance, still chewing.  Die of Fate gives the troll back 4 HP.  She's at 44.  Her eye scabs over with fresh green tissue.<br/><br/>"We need fire or acid, guys!" says JM.  "Mist throws more rations at it!"<br/><br/>"Next round, honey.  What are the rest of you doing?"<br/><br/>"Hmm," says J for Ingor.  "I have a wand of acid spraying.  Would that work?  It has five charges."<br/><br/>I stare at him.  Goddamn.  I'd forgotten about that.  It was a random loot result from that website.  "That\u2026would work," I tell them.<br/><br/>"Ingor puts away his bow and gets out the wand."<br/><br/>That'll take you this round, I tell him.<br/><br/>Romrama prepares to hit the troll from the flank as he was standing off to the side.  At first, he's going to use his axe (retrieved from the hobgoblin corpse) and protect himself with his shield, but the kids tell him he should use the bugbear's wolf-headed maul.  It's a two-handed weapon, and for a moment, he struggles with the prospect of not using his shield.  In the end, the wolf-head cool wins over.<br/><br/>"OK, I'll use the mace," he says.  "I take it in both hands and get ready to attack."<br/><br/>Rhavaniel throws rations this time, and <i>(success)</i> once again catches the troll's attention.  The hag squats to eat this little appetizer.  Mist moves between the troll and Amber, her elven sword up on guard.  Ingor readies his wand.<br/><br/>The troll <i>(die of Fate = 5)</i> regenerates to 49 HP.  Her healing eye reopens with a squelch, messy fluids trickling down her greasy cheek.<br/><br/>New round.  Ingor steps forward and <i>(success on INT to activate the wand)</i> and <i>(success to aim it properly)</i>  directs a stream of green vapor from the wand to the troll's chest, where it sizzles madly for (3d6 roll) 11 HP of damage!  The troll takes 9 after armor and drops to 40 HP.  The hag shrieks and stands, flailing at her smoking chest!<br/><br/>I note the non-regenerable damage separately, so the troll's max HP is now 41 for purposes of this encounter.<br/><br/>The kids cheer.  The angry troll takes a stride toward Ingor, and now Romrama makes his move.  He leaps forward and <i>(partial success)</i> swings the maul into the troll's femur, where it deals out 8 HP with a loud crack of bone.  The troll staggers and drops to one knee.  Snarling, she backhands the dwarf for 12 HP.  Romrama flies backward a good twenty feet and slams into the chapel wall.  After his armor and Tough, he still takes 10 damage.  The troll is at 34 HP, still with a max of 41.<br/><br/>I'm about to tell him he's Dazed until next round, but C interrupts me.  "Can I be Knocked Out?"  <br/><br/>I blink. "You want to be Out?  Sure."<br/><br/>"Awesome Point!" he crows, and takes a crystal from the resin bowl.<br/><br/>What are Mist and Amber and Lostariel and Rhavaniel doing? I ask.<br/><br/>Mist stays on guard.  Amber is thinking.  Lostariel readies a dagger to throw.  Rhavaniel nocks another arrow for the next round.  The kids realize they can't just hack this thing down.  Their toughest fighter just got swatted down easy-peasy.<br/><br/>JM tells J he has to use his acid wand.  It's their only hope!<br/><br/>J balks.  "I don't want to use it all up!" he says.  "It's only got four charges left!"<br/><br/>"You have to!" says S.<br/><br/>J shakes his head.  "I'm not going to."<br/><br/>Interesting, I think.  I hadn't run into this sort of reaction before.  Resource conservation, yes.  But J is clearly identifying as an Elf with an Acid Wand.  He doesn't want to lose that tag.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the round ends, and the troll <i>(die of FATE = 4)</i> straightens its leg and stands with a wet click of knitting bone.  Her HP come back up to 38.  She snarls.<br/><br/>What are you doing? I ask the table.<br/><br/>The kids yell for Ingor to shoot it again with his wand.  "Fine," he says.  "But just this one time."  Ingor levels the wand and <i>(success on both activation and to-hit)</i> blasts it with another dose of acid, this time for a measly 7 HP.  the troll is down to 33 overall, and its max is now 36.  J finds this a bit disheartening.  I describe how the wand sears the troll's shoulder but seems to be a glancing hit, which is why it doesn't do as much damage.<br/><br/>Rhavaniel <i>(partial success)</i> shoots an arrow right into that freshly seared shoulder, doing 4 damage which leaves the troll at 31.  The troll fixates on her and charges to destroy the source of pain!<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> A steak through the heart?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404563/#Comment_404563" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T13:39:04+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  1:39PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2013 9:36AM by Hexabolic.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As the enraged troll begins its charge, Mist leaps in front of the troll and <i>(success)</i> throws a <i>steak</i> at it!<br/><br/>Waitaminute.  "A steak?" I ask.<br/><br/>"Mist likes to eat well," JM tells me.  "It's part of her rations."<br/><br/>"Awesome Point," says S, handing JM a crystal.<br/><br/>OK, well\u2026cool.  The steak hits the troll in the face, and she stops and catches it, sniffing furiously.  She jams the meat into her mouth and closes her eyes in bliss.<br/><br/>"Can Amber summon a Sleep spirit to put it to sleep?" asks JM.<br/><br/>"Sure, if you have something nearby that's asleep that can be an anchor for the spirit."<br/><br/>"Hmm."  She thinks about it.  <br/><br/>"There are corpses here," suggests S.<br/><br/>"They're a bit <i>too</i> asleep," I answer.<br/><br/>"Romrama is unconscious," JM notes.  "Would that work?"<br/><br/>"I'll stay knocked out!" C offers.<br/><br/>Yep, that'd work, I tell her.  So Amber <del>opens her mind to the Otherworld</del> swigs a dose of quicksilver and calls on a spirit of Sleep this round.  It'll manifest next round.<br/><br/>(I should add here that Amber having gone through her Star of Otherworldly Madness/Mutation last session, her magical warp is that her hair now moves as through constantly windblown, wind or no.  All the kids think this is pure awesome.  Experienced mages in this world are clearly freaks.)<br/><br/>Ingor refuses to shoot at first, but the kids prevail on him to zap the troll again with the acid wand. This time, he <i>(success)</i> on activation, but <i>(failure)</i> on aim means the shot goes wide as the troll drops into a low crouch and continues to chew the delicious, delicious steak.  Ingor is bummed, not in a bad sport way, but because he doesn't want to tap out his wand.  There are two charges left.<br/><br/>Left unsaid here is that the kids have been burning through the Awesome Points to elevate their die results, so their supply is thin.  There's not enough in the party to rescue this wand roll.  Also, Ingor has to make an activation roll because he doesn't have Lore.  He gets to use the wand at all because he has a Wizard Special Ability.  This is, admittedly, a bit of a hacked interpretation, but there you are.<br/><br/>"Mist takes her sword in both hands.  I'm going to cut its arm off!" JM declares.<br/><br/>"Next round, honey," I tell her.<br/><br/>Lostariel throws a dagger that does 2 HP to the troll after armor, sticking in the troll's bony scalp.  "HOO!" the hag utters, standing again, rage rekindled in her beady black eyes.<br/><br/>End of round.  The hag regenerates <i>(die of FATE = 2)</i> to 31, so this round is a wash, damage-wise.<br/><br/>New round.  The troll lunges toward Lostariel, the last person to deal it damage.  Mist steps up and <i>(crit)</i> for 11 points of damage after armor, takes off the hag's left arm arm at the elbow.  The troll is down to 20 HP, but all this is regenerable.  But the troll howls as her black blood splashes around her.  Mist easily tumbles out of reach, sword held high in a cool pose.  The troll gnashes her teeth as her severed arm thrashes around on the flagstones.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the sleep spirit <i>(crit!)</i> materializes in front of Amber.  I gather some evocative details from the kids around the table, and what comes of it is blue smoke, glass, and shadows.  JM describes it as a unicorn made of blue smoke and shadow with a glass horn and glass eyes, but if you look at it differently, it's a nightmare.  So it's dream one way, nightmare the next.<br/><br/>Awesome, I think.  Wow.  The girl continues to surprise me with her raw creativity.<br/><br/>"What do you wish me to do for you, wizard?" asks the spirit.<br/><br/>Now, Amber could Command it, but she thinks that's mean, and the crit roll gave her an Awesome Point and the chance to ally with this spirit.<br/><br/>"I want you to put that troll to sleep!"<br/><br/>"Is that all?" the spirit asks.<br/><br/>"Would you like to be my friend?"<br/><br/>"What would you give me for my service?"<br/><br/>JM thinks, but only for a second.  The troll is moving, after all.  "You can take one of my dreams every month!"<br/><br/>Jesus Christ, <i>yes.</i>  The spirit agrees.  "On the night of the new moon each month, I will take your dream that night."<br/><br/>S thinks this is cool, too.  "Whoa.  You might have this awesome idea or prophecy or something, but then you wouldn't get it because the spirit would take it.  That's really awesome."<br/><br/>The unicorn spirit leans out and its horn traces delicate whorls of tiny words and pictures across Mist's eyelids.  "The bargain is sealed, mortal."  For a moment, it's the nightmare speaking, its mouth full of shadows.<br/><br/>The spirit vanishes in a sigh of blue smoke, which moves to the troll.  A moment later, the hag <i>(success)</i> shuts her eyes, yawns, and flops down onto the flagstones with a snore.  Her arm's stump <i>(die of Fate = 6!)</i> blisters over as a new hand begins to push out.  She is back up to 36 HP, her cap after all the acid damage.<br/><br/>Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.  The only problem now is what to do with the troll.  She might wake up.  She's really strong, and she's regenerating.  Rations are low.<br/><br/>"No more steaks?" S asks JM.  JM shakes her head.  "Mist only had one."<br/><br/>They talk about it.  J is adamant about not wasting his acid wand charges, but the kids don't have enough to burn at hand, and they're not clear they can get a fire started before the monster wakes.<br/><br/>"I can cut its head off," Mist says.<br/><br/>"But then it'll just regenerate," Rhavaniel muses.  "Ingor needs to use his acid wand."<br/><br/>Ingor protests, but he's eventually convinced this is OK so long as he can do so economically enough to keep a charge.  They ask me whether, if Mist decapitates the hag quickly, Ingor can sear the head and neck stumps with one charge.<br/><br/>So long as the head doesn't roll away, I tell them.<br/><br/>So that's what they do.  Mist <i>(success)</i> cuts off the head, and Ingor <i>(success)</i> activates the wand.  I don't make him roll to aim, and I don't have him roll damage.  This is a smart plan.<br/><br/>I describe how the troll's eyes open in rage, and her teeth gnash as the acid sears her.  The body flops around, the head gnashes until Mist takes her elven sword in both hands and spikes it into the flagstones to keep it still.<br/><br/>I'm practically standing there with my mouth hanging open at this.<br/><br/>Romrama stirs and sits up.  "What'd I miss?" he asks in a nice bit of RP.  "Did we win?"<br/><br/>"No," S says.  "She's eating us!"<br/><br/>Everybody smiles, even J.  He still has one charge in his wand, and his magic enabled them to defeat this thing.  It was a real team effort, and I give them all XP and Awesome Points to reinforce the point.<br/><br/>"Nice job, Dungeon Kids," I say with feeling.  "Nice job."<br/><br/>S asks me if the sun can come up and turn the troll to stone.  It's nearly dawn in game time, so I describe how they do their healing and general clean up, and when the sun comes up, Mist pulls her sword free just before the still twitching troll head petrifies with the touch of sunlight.<br/><br/>"OK, go play," I say, and the kids scatter from the table like puppies.  I'm left alone with a table covered in character sheets and glory.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> The Dungeon Girls go EPIC.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p5" rel="next">5</a><a class=" p-6 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p6">6</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p5" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17329%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17329%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[World of Dungeons] Dungeon Girls! - Page 5 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p5" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[World of Dungeons] Dungeon Girls! - Page 5" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p5" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="What?

The Dungeon Girls session we had this last weekend blew my socks off.  I don't know if it'll impress the readers here, but...yeah.  I'll just have to write it up.  The girls (and Niff) are taking it to the next level.<br/><br/>Romrama <i>volunteered</i> to be knocked out.  I've told them they can volunteer for nontrivial consequences to get Awesome Points.  He did so without prompting and was perfectly happy with that.  In fact, it worked out great, given Amber's idea of calling a sleep spirit.<br/><br/>Regarding the "Opening your mind to the Otherworld" move to bypass quicksilver, I was worried at first, but I made it clear to JM that it's a spiral.  The first time you fill up the star, it's just weird, but not harmful or terribly inconvenient.  The second time, it's somewhat inconvenient, but not harmful or grotesque.  The third time, it's groteque.  The fourth time, it's harmful in some way.  Past that, each subsequent filling of the star piles on the serious.  She seems to be taking the cautionary note to heart.  And...as I write this, I'm looking over my notes and finding out she'd actually taken quicksilver after all.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not worried about it anymore.  I told the DG the same thing about escalation: weird, inconvenient, grotesque, harmful.  They don't mind weird or inconvenient, but grotesque and harmful definitely have them worried.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404798/#Comment_404798" name="Item_203" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T00:29:04+00:00" title="January 28, 2013 12:29AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OMG the troll battle.

The purple worm is more like a giant caterpillar with beetle pincers, huge, with a maw big enough to swallow a standing man.<br/><br/>Our player call today is four, since Elder Moppet is down with the flu and girl L is out of state.  We've relocated to G's house, a pleasant, light-filled open space with a larger table.  Snacks are abundant, as G's mom is a great host.  G's dad is graciously watching the football playoffs in another room.  G, M, A, and F gather around the table.<br/><br/>We've upgraded to the new character sheets I posted earlier in this thread.  The kids like them and seem to appreciate the clarity.<br/><br/>When I came up with this encounter, I decided to hit them with a beast.  To date, everything the players have fought has been in the realm of 1 to 15 HP.  The worm has 75 HP and 3 armor.  Its Qualities (descriptors) are Massive, Gross, and Immune to Mental Effects.  Its Instincts are Eat Everything, Get Scourge First, and Swallow or Crush.  It does 3d6 damage, with a chance of swallowing its prey if said prey fails an Escape the Maw roll.  Since I haven't thrown anything like this at them, I have no idea how hard this will be to take down, but I'm envisioning a serious contest.<br/><br/>So the worm is approaching, its massive bulk slithering over the sandy terrain, the first quarter of its body rearing up.  The party has a few rounds of night vision bestowed on them by Andromeda's spirit.  Valavanora's spirit Mir had identified a weak spot on the worm's left, not too far from the head.  This is a scabby network of scar tissue unprotected by the worm's thick mottled hide.  The monkey has been shrieking and running back and forth trying to stab the spot with a kitchen knife, but now it scampers away.  The merchant at the camp has fled in terror on a mule, leaving his wagon and goods behind.<br/><br/>The characters had scrambled to come up with a strategy.  The general position has Arselan, and Andromeda flanking the worm's left, trying for a shot at the weak spot.  Niff and Arian hold the center.  Valavanora is flanking on the worm's right.  They'd had a round of arrow volleys for a meager total of 5 damage, knocking the worm down to 70 HP as we start the combat.<br/><br/>The worm seems to be making for Arian, who is trying to decide between her masterwork bow and Scourge.  At last she decides to try out the sword of power, though reluctantly.  Its <i>Fated Weapon</i> number is 1, which means the sword's spirit is sullen and bestows the tag of <b>unlucky</b> on Arian.<br/><br/>The worm charges!<br/><br/>Arselan runs up to the weak spot, plants himself, and taking his masterwork sword in both hands, hews at the weak spot.  G describes how the paladin is using the worm's momentum to add to the force of his blow, and I tell her that's worth a +1 bonus to damage.  His blade <i>(critical!)</i> slices through the worm's weak spot (no armor) practically to the hilt, opening a long, deep cut for 24 HP of damage!  Green gore spills out of the wound.  I describe the <i>shhhliik!</i> sound the sword makes.  Everyone is impressed.<br/><br/>Here's how I've been handling combat crits.  Generally, if a critter has HP less than or equal to the normal max damage of the player, and no special abilities or immunities apply, a crit gives an insta-kill or a kill with style if it's more of a coup de grace situation (1 or 2 HP left, for example).  Depending on circumstances, I may allow a situational advantage or hold going forward.  Otherwise, I double the total damage.  So Arselan rolled 12 HP of damage (masterwork longsword for 1d6+2, +3 STR, +1 damage bonus) that doubled. <br/><br/>The worm is dumped to 46 HP.  <i>Jesus.</i><br/><br/>Andromeda the Necromancer is up next, since I'm going clockwise around the table.  She steps up with her longsword in one hand, swings at Arselan's cut and <i>(critical!)</i> delivers an additional 12 HP to the worm that opens up that gaping wound even more.  The monster is down to 34 HP already, and we're only halfway through the round.<br/><br/>Niff is up next as the worm charges Arian.  He <i>(success)</i> hurls a frost globe from the Skitterlings, aiming for the mouth.  He hits a pincer and does 10 HP of cold, bypassing armor and immobilizing the right pincer for fictional positioning purposes.  The worm is at 24.<br/><br/>Valavanora shoots another arrow, since EM had told me last session she wants to conserve spirit use for a bit.  She's an NPC today, so I just roll the damage: 5 HP.  After subtracting the 3 Armor, the worm is down to 22 HP.<br/><br/>What does Arian do? I ask. Leap aside and take a cut or leap into the maw of the worm and strike at the frozen part of the mouth?  You might bypass armor if you do that, I add, trying to lure her in to the pincers and their poisonous barbs.<br/><br/>M hesitates.  "I don't know.  Probably leap aside..."<br/><br/>This elicits a chorus of "Go inside!  Do the mouth!  Go for it!"<br/><br/>After a moment, she sighs.  "All right.  I'll probably regret this, but\u2026I leap inside and use Scourge to hack at the frozen part."<br/><br/>Arian boldly leaps inside, swings Scourge at the pincer, and\u2026rolls a 6 and a 4.  Scourge's Deadly power means 6's explode.  I tell her to keep the six and roll an additional die.  She does so and\u2026rolls a 6.  She keeps that and rolls another 6 and then a 1, for a total to-hit well into crit territory.<br/><br/>Arian has STR of +1, so her initial roll isn't a crit.  Good as it is, Scourge doesn't come with a to-hit bonus.  However, the first die explosion gets the crit, and the second one\u2026hmm.<br/><br/>Having played Ars Magica and dealt with exploding crits on rolls of 1, I decide each crit 6 earns another crit. I don't know if I'll keep that, since it seems utterly deadly.  But I'll try it out for now.<br/><br/>She rolls 3 damage, which yields a total of 6 after her STR and sword bonuses factor in.  6 doubles to 12, which doubles again to 24, which hits the worm in a spot with no armor and obliterates its remaining HP.<br/><br/>I describe how Scourge cuts into the worm at the point where the pincer joins to the head and how despite the blade's modest length, it delivers a twenty foot cut that shears off half the worm's head in a slimy <i>SSHHHKT</i> of green gore.  Empowered by her stellar critical, Arian lands safely without being hit by the caustic blood, landing in a relatively clean area of sandy ground.  The worm collapses, dead as dirt.  Its insides leak out of the hideous wounds and spread upon the starlit ground.  The caterpillar legs make one final spasm and shift the worm forward about ten feet.  Then it lies still. <br/><br/>The party is quiet.  M looks a little stunned. <br/><br/>Andromeda breaks the silence.  "Woo hoo! We did it!"<br/><br/>"I don't know if I like this sword," M murmurs.

World of Dungeons doesn't really have any rules that encourage good sportsmanship. It's a product created at the table, not in the text.<br/><br/>EDIT: Although if you want to file Blake's Awesome Points and "you can't die unless you want to die" house rules under "system matters", I suppose those two things would encourage the good sportsmanship.

Both groups of kids are mature for their respective ages, at least as far as cooperative play goes.  I've been trying to model the sportsmanship factor by showing lots of appreciation of their actions and offering as much transparency with my agenda as possible, but it's an easy sell.<br/><br/>For example, their unselfish use of Awesome Points to help one another wasn't something I suggested, but emerged organically from their own negotiation.  It quickly became a group custom, very natural, unquestioned.  Likewise their evenhanded split of items, XP, and treasure.  It's sort of evolved into a natural creative socialism at the table.  There was no discussion around it, just a question to me if they could do it in the first place.  Once I said yes, the practice took off.<br/><br/>System obviously matters, too.  The mechanics are streamlined, yet produce rich results at the table.  We're not spending time consulting tables or trying to figure out esoteric rules.  In-game conflict moments resolve quickly and intuitively, with lots of room for creative leverage.  Even with this group, I suspect a crunchy system like any edition of D&amp;D past the first would have slowed things down a lot and put up fences around the free-ranging creativity I've seen with these groups.<br/><br/><i>EDITED to add: For this play genre, <b>Dungeon World</b> would very likely work with these kids, maybe <b>13th Age.</b></i><br/><br/>I've thought about how they'd do with something like the upcoming FATE Accelerated, Lady Blackbird, or Wushu.  They all (well, the moppets and their besties) say they like WoDu better than <i>Faery's Tale,</i> in part because WoDu and the AW-DW core mechanic map so well to clear fictional results.  EM also thinks the high fantasy backdrop is easier to engage with than a faery forest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405066/#Comment_405066" name="Item_222" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T17:38:49+00:00" title="January 30, 2013  5:38PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm kind of stunned and impressed that the DG group has become such a thing that you ran it for them at another girl's house while your daughter was home sick.<br/><br/>The fact that these teenage girls wanted to play a fantasy rpg with their friend's dad so much that they had you come GM for them even when their friend was not available says a lot, as far as I'm concerned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405068/#Comment_405068" name="Item_223" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T18:43:53+00:00" title="January 30, 2013  6:43PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            True, though I'm the one driving the scheduling.

Their magically enhanced sight gives them a clear picture as they assess the gigantic corpse.  Their sense of triumph is interrupted as Niff asks whether the worm's hide is worth anything.<br/><br/>"It's pretty thick hide, right?"<br/><br/>Yeah, I say.  3 Armor's worth.<br/><br/>"Great.  How much money?"<br/><br/>I don't know, I answer.  You'll have to haggle over that, but it's sure not something common.<br/><br/>F nods.  "It's probably worth getting some and selling it.  I'm going to get out my sword and start cutting off some hide."<br/><br/>"Ooh, me too!" says A.  "And I want to get some of the poison sacs from the mandibles."<br/><br/>The other characters follow suit, right down to the paladin.  Within moments, they have pivoted from fighting a monster to reducing it to parts.<br/><br/>Don't waste any part of the monster, a little stunned voice in my head whispers.<br/><br/>"How much can we get?" asks F.  I give a rough estimate as they all roll STR to see how much worm hide they can flay off the massive corpse.  Their night vision expires, and they produce torches and lanterns from their supplies, their characters continuing their practical butchery.<br/><br/>"You could write a book on how to dress a worm," I quip.<br/><br/>"Hey," A says, "I could summon a spirit and make a huge zombie of this thing.  Wouldn't that be awesome?"<br/><br/>Yes, I say.  Awesome is one way to describe it.<br/><br/>"Gross," says Arian's player, M.<br/><br/>Arselan nods agreement.  "That sounds sort of evil to me."<br/><br/>"Oh, come on," says A.  "It'd be cool!  And if any of you die, I could bring you back as zombies!  Just think how great it would be to have a zombie army with a giant undead worm!"  She goes on to wax enthusiastic about zombies and especially the zombie worm.  The other players don't think it's a good idea and are growing a little antsy as A continues to be carried away by her idea.<br/><br/>I decide to have a little fun of my own.  "Hey, is Andromeda saying this stuff out loud for reals?"<br/><br/>A shoots me a quizzical look.  "Huh?  What do you mean?"<br/><br/>"Are you saying this zombie and undead army stuff out loud?"<br/><br/>"Why?"<br/><br/>I jerk my chin at M.  "Someone," I say, "<i>someone</i> might have half-drawn a certain sword without being aware of doing so.  Its garnet pommel might be pulsing deep red, like a coal."<br/><br/>A pauses, her mouth open.  "Ah.  <i>No.</i>  No, I'm not saying any of this out loud."  She proceeds to change the topic away from zombie creation toward how she's going to dig poison sacs out of the mandibles.  And can she find the worm's brain?<br/><br/>M's lips curve in a little smile.  "I think I'm starting to <i>like</i> this sword."<br/><br/>The characters proceed to work through the night, until each of them has a couple of yards of rolled and tied worm hide. A has recovered some poison from the pincers.  It's at this point conversation turns to the merchant's wagon.  Andromeda starts looking through it for glassware to store the poison she's harvested.  Debate springs up around whether the party is entitled to take what they want without payment.<br/><br/>Andromeda and Niff fall on the side of "the merchant bugged out and abandoned us, so this is all ours."<br/><br/>Arselan takes the position of "it's not ours, and we shouldn't take anything without paying a fair price."<br/><br/>Arian wavers at first, but comes down on Arselan's side.  Stalemate among the day's players.  The arguments pretty much follow iterations of the summaries above.  Eventually, the Lawful position wins.  Arselan makes the point that they have plenty of gold, and the merchant wasn't a bad guy.  They decide to have Valavanora send her peregrine falcon familiar to carry a message to the merchant and guide him back.  Then they take what they want and set aside some funds from their coin to pay for it.  All this comes from roleplaying.  The only die rolls in this section are about how much hide they can whack off in the time they have available.<br/><br/>M does not use Scourge for this bloody task, as she gets the vibe from it that such work is beneath a Sword of Power.<br/><br/>When the merchant eventually returns, he is enormously grateful and gives them the glassware for a token price.  Niff asks for cinnamon, I think because he has some idea of making a cinnamon bomb, and they buy out the merchant's stock.  Everybody's happy, even Andromeda, because even though she didn't' get a zombie worm or free loot from the merchant's wagon, she has worm poison and a roll of bloody hide that represents extra silvers when they get to the next town.<br/><br/>After some deliberation, they decide to head to the coast and take ship for Ankhyra.  Arselan wants to be on the water, and several kids (including Valavanora in outside conversations I've had with Elder Moppet) are eager to fight pirates on the high seas.  Hmm, I dunno.  <i>Flag,</i> anyone?<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> The gates of the port of Durat-Zur</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406160/#Comment_406160" name="Item_227" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T14:33:46+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  2:33PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Man, I'm so behind on this.  After I get caught up on this episode, I think I'll have to stick to highlights.  My apologies for taking so long.</i><br/><br/>So continuing the current session, the party arrives at the city of Durat-Zur, a port on the inner sea (name TBA).  I describe a city a bit like Tangiers, surrounded by high rose-colored walls, irrigated fields and orchards.  The characters approach a gate that appears heavily defended, with guards checking everyone entering the city.<br/><br/>At this point, I have nothing prepped, so I take out the CITY tables from the random tables I'd downloaded from Story Games.  Rolls produce the result (and I paraphrase) "The nobility is playing games."  So I figure the guards are searching people and harassing outsiders.<br/><br/>Andromeda tries to talk to the guards and <i>(failure)</i> causes them to deny the party entry.  This result throws the party for a loop.  As I continue to roll on the CITY table, I come up with a monster result that reads like "They seek to enslave."  I flash to a concept that the entire city has been taken over by a mind-controlling monster\u2026sort of like a miniature version of the zombie apocalypse.<br/><br/><i>Mind-flayers.</i>  Oh yeah.  And inspired by <i>The Wrath of Khan</i>, they are doing it via some sort of brain parasite administered through drinking water.  OK, now I have a plan.<br/><br/>Arselan steps up and <i>(partial success)</i> persuades the guards to reconsider.  They do so, but are only willing to admit the paladin, and only if he leaves his weapons behind.  After a brief consult with the other players, G agrees. Arselan hands his weapons to Niff and begins to lead his warhorse through the shaded arch of the gatehouse.<br/><br/>At this point, I ask Arian to roll WIS.  M does so, and <i>(success since she has Awareness)</i> receives a secret note in the form of a folded 3x5 card from me.  The note reads, "You notice the guards seem unusually stiff and glassy-eyed, carrying their duties with flat expressions."<br/><br/>A, seated next to M, immediately wants to know what the note says.<br/><br/>"Arian, do you share your observation with Andromeda?" I ask.<br/><br/>"OK, I guess, sure."  M leans over and opens the card so A can read it.  They whisper excitedly.<br/><br/>I pitch my voice to carry and tell G, "Arselan, as you enter the city, your warhorse clopping behind you, the guard captain approaches you with a silver goblet in his calloused hands, saying, 'Greetings, honored paladin.  The masters of the city bid you accept the drink of friendship."<br/><br/>A and M freak out, and begin howling at G.  "NO!  ARSELAN!  Don't drink!  Don't take the goblet!"  Let me be clear: by "freak out," I mean full on, squealing, standing and bouncing up and down hysteria.  They are losing it in a thoroughly awesome way.  I'm a little nonplussed, honestly.  See, A is very dramatic and prone to excitement, so her reaction isn't a surprise.  M, however, has been very measured and thoughtful in her RP to this point.  But here they both are, going nuts and shouting over each other, clearly caught up in this sweet, sweet moment of suspense.  I guess it's the equivalent of "you see the zombie shuffling up behind your friend, but your friend doesn't" kind of thing.<br/><br/>I can't stop laughing, not just because of the girls' reaction, but because G's expression shows she's completely baffled.  She gestures at A and M, perfectly portraying Arselan's confusion as he raises his hands to beckon for a clearer explanation.  The two girls continue to shriek delightedly and shake their heads at G.  <br/><br/>"DON'T DRINK!" they shout.  "DON'T DO IT!"<br/><br/>G exchanges a look with F, who shakes his head.  He's equally lost, but tells me Niff produces one of his lightning guns and takes aim at the cup.<br/><br/>The guard captain holds the cup closer.  "Drink, traveler, from the cup, and join us in friendship."<br/><br/>After a moment, Arselan shakes his head.  "Thank you, but I will drink later."<br/><br/>Two guards on either side of Arselan seize him and the guard captain grabs the paladin by the jaw and raises the silver cup.  "You <i>will</i>  drink, traveler.  You will be a friend of the masters."  Arselan tries to free himself, but <i>(failure)</i> the guards hold him fast.  The girls' hysteria hits a new crescendo.<br/><br/>The girls are still shrieking when Niff fires the lightning gun and <i>(success)</i> blows the goblet out of the guard captain's hand, the discharge branding the hand in the process.  Arselan <i>(success)</i> shakes off the guards at last and whistles for his warhorse, who begins to wheel and kick, clearing the area.  Niff runs under the arch to back up Arselan as more guards begin to emerge from the towers, moving in eerie, coordinated silence.  Behind them, civilians in the street near the gatehouse also begin to turn and approach the gate, their faces blank.<br/><br/>From the top of the guardhouse, a bunch of guards appear with bows in hand and prepare to loose a volley at the party.  Nunk moans in terror.  Not more arrows!<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> Battle at the Gatehouse and Questionable Necromancy</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil" title="m_busuttil"><img alt="m_busuttil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil">m_busuttil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406169/#Comment_406169" name="Item_228" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T17:39:36+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  5:39PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious: what would you have done if he'd drunk?<br/><br/>(Also: I've read this whole thread in one go, and have been continually surprised at how awesome these kids are.

Nunk, unfortunately, takes several and drops to one knee.  Valavanora (an NPC here) takes a slug of quicksilver and calls on her fire spirit Koriander to burn the bowstrings of the guards, a stunt the spirit is getting good enough at for me to consider boosting the effect at some point in the near future.  The Druid and Sklarah hunker next to Nunk and try to help him.  Since Valavanora has the Heal skill now, that seems an appropriate thing to do.<br/><br/>Scourge in hand, Arian uses her frog ring to leap atop the battlement and avoid the arrows, but she <i>(partial success)</i>  misjudges her leap and lands with precarious footing while the guards cast aside their bows aside and draw short swords.  One of them <i>(die of Fate = greater than 1 for her "unlucky" tag)</i> grabs her by her free arm.  Her lion Hodari evades harm by springing into the gatehouse and mauling a guard.<br/><br/>Arselan <i>(success)</i> grapples with the guard captain and throws him against the wall, stunning him.  Niff <i>(crit!)</i> charges in, avoiding the stubby grabby efforts of the intervening guards, and throws the paladin the weapons Niff had been holding for him.  Then he unlimbers his +2 Kite Shield and shoves back an incoming guard while the warhorse wheels and kicks.  Add the mighty fierce lion, and it's Pandemonium under the archway.<br/><br/>Andromeda <i>(success)</i>  uses her Necklace of Mouse Size to shrink to the size of a mouse and dodge the arrows that way.  Once small, she skitters aside, weaving through other confused travelers to get to a place farther down the wall where she can enact a Summoning.<br/><br/>The other players shift nervously when they hear Andromeda is going to summon something.  "Is that really the best idea?" M asks.<br/><br/>A says, "Of course!" Or words to that effect.  A sigh passes around the table, and several heads shake.  Necromancy, you know?<br/><br/>"I can't see any good coming from this," murmurs F.<br/><br/>Andromeda returns to full size, takes a deep breath and opens her mind to the Otherworld to begin the summoning of\u2026what, exactly?<br/><br/>"A spirit of possession so I can free the city."<br/><br/>That would be a HUGE spirit, I say.  You'll be able to free 3d6 worth of guards unless you summon something really, really big.  Which would, I say with relish, be dangerous.<br/><br/>She pauses before answering, "I think I'll go with a regular spirit."<br/><br/>It has to be a Necromantic spirit, I caution.  Something to do with Death, the Dead, Decay, or Darkness.  <br/><br/>"How about Worms?" she asks.<br/><br/>Worms is good.  We like worms.  So Andromeda begins her summoning.  She doesn't have a Name, but the presence of the possessed guards and citizenry qualify as an example of the domain she seeks.  Using bone dust from her pouch and a stick to scratch out a hasty circle, she starts her ritual.<br/><br/>Arselan <i>(success)</i> lays hands on the guard captain and uses Cure to free him of the mind flayer's control.  This works because the guard coughs out a small, red, squid-like creature about the size of a plum.  The guard shudders as his volition returns to him, and Niff <i>(success)</i> manages to fend off a pair of oncoming guards.  Arselan whistles for his warhorse.<br/><br/>Up on top of the battlement, Arian <i>(partial success)</i> regains her balance and slams Scourge into a guard.  She keeps her partial success even though she opts to put one of her dice showing a 5 into the sword per the FATED WEAPON power.  Scourge glows coal red and drops the tag "unlucky" for "messy."  The guard frowns as blood pours from his severed arm.  The guard who has hold of her other arm, however, pulls her down and the other guards (there are nine in all, close in, trying to grapple.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a shadow opens in Andromeda's impromptu circle.  Through it rises a grotesque marionette held on shadowy strings.  Its body and head are made of writhing worms.<br/><br/>"What service do you wish me to render upon you, Necromancer?" it intones.  I rasp up my voice for this, somewhere between Christopher Walken and Gollum.<br/><br/>"Free the possessed people in the city!" Andromeda asks.<br/><br/>"That is beyond my power," I remind her through the spirit.  "I can perhaps cut the strings on a score, but no more."<br/><br/>Then\u2026hmm.  Andromeda thinks about it, as A opens a discussion about who she should try to free.  The players start talking about tactical priorities, and I have the other players go through a roll.  NPC wise, Valavanora calls upon Koriander again to create a ring of fire to keep her, Sklarah, and Nunk safe while things are going down.<br/><br/>Under the gate, Arselan <i>(success)</i> leaps astride his horse and cuts a dashing figure as the horse slams through the guards into the city proper.  Niff <i>(success)</i>  blocks a couple of spears with his shield and pulls his lightning gun.  On the other side of the gate, he <i>(success on Awareness)</i> sees a formidable-looking cloaked figure in white scale armor approaching from the stable, holding what appear to be matching wheel lock pistols in each gauntleted hand.<br/><br/>"Want," says F, reaching for the dice.  "I'm going to blast him with my lightning gun."<br/><br/>Better be quick, I tell him.  Guy's drawing a bead on Arselan, who <i>(success)</i> leans down to grab a guard by the face and <i>(success)</i> Cure him.<br/><br/>Atop the battlement, Arian is in trouble as <i>(failure)</i> the guards work in eerie synchronization to seize her by the arms and slam her against the crenellation.  One of them smashes her sword hand against the stone for a few HP.  She feels bone crack, but Scourge will not let her release her grip.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the side talk that has been swirling around all this has Andromeda bargaining to free most of the guards on the battlement and as many of the guards in the gatehouse as possible.<br/><br/>"What do you want in return for this?" she asks the spirit.<br/><br/>The spirit's mouth splits in a horrible wormy grin.  "A day of your life, to be given in one of the next four days."<br/><br/>"Oh, bad idea, bad id-<i>eee</i>-aa\u2026" is the general consensus around the table.<br/><br/>Andromeda doesn't care much for this.  "Uhm...how about twelve hours?"<br/><br/>The spirit chuckles, and I ham this up with phlegm.  "I accept...if my time begins <i>immediately."</i><br/><br/>Andromeda hesitates, clearly not comfortable with this notion.  "What will you do with my body?"<br/><br/>"Oh, simply enjoy the many delights of corporeal existence."  The spirit's worms writhe a little faster.<br/><br/>"Do you promise not to hurt anyone while you're in my body?" Andromeda asks.  "I don't want any of my friends hurt.  Or innocent people."<br/><br/>"Perhaps," the spirit says. "Do you wish to extend my time?"<br/><br/>"Not really. How about--"<br/><br/>At this point, I tell Arian:  "The guards force you down against the crenellation.  One guard approaches with his sword held high as he readies himself to cut off your hand, still holding Scourge in a painful grip--"<br/><br/>M's voice rises in agitation.  "HELP!"<br/><br/>"Do it!" Someone says, I don't remember whether it was F or G.<br/><br/>Andromeda grimaces. <i>"Done."</i><br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b>  Cut Strings, Burly Dudes, and the Small Requests of Goddesses</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406342/#Comment_406342" name="Item_233" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T16:00:53+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  4:00PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Woooooooo!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406343/#Comment_406343" name="Item_234" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T16:01:07+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  4:01PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2013 12:41PM by Hexabolic.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andromeda rolls for the spirit's effort and gets 16 as the result.   A describes how Andromeda feels a sensation of falling backward into a deep well of darkness and wakes in a narrow, dank room with two small windows set next to the high ceiling, suggestive of eyes.<br/><br/>It's clear she could sit out the session, so I wonder about alternatives and inspiration strikes.  Andromeda falls again into darkness and blinks.  She is in a different body lurching toward Arselan and Niff from the city side.  She gets right away what's going on.<br/><br/>"Please don't let me be a dude, please don't let me be a dude\u2026," A mutters to herself.  <br/><br/>Die of FATE says\u2026"You're a dude."<br/><br/>"Aww, man!" she covers her face and shakes her head in mock despair.  M and G laugh.  It's all in good fun, but they are digging this.<br/><br/>"Oh my gosh," M says.  "You're a <i>guy!"</i><br/><br/>"I'm\u2026a\u2026dude," A whimpers.  "Goh!"  She pleads for me not to tell my daughter, to which I answer with an evil laugh.<br/><br/>It turns out <i>(die of FATE)</i> Andromeda's occupying the body of a tall, young, muscular guy, maybe a kind of smith with his bare arms.<br/><br/>Oh.  Well, that's not so bad, she allows, perking up.  "At least I'm a burly guy.  I can bust heads!"<br/><br/>There is that.<br/><br/> "Where's my body?" she asks.<br/><br/>Oh, I say, waving airily.  Somewhere out there, beneath the big blue sky.<br/><br/>She gives her head a little shake.  "Oboy.  NOT good."<br/><br/>But then she shouts at Arselan, "Hey, Arselan!  It's me!  Andromeda!" and proceeds <i>(success)</i> to bust heads of nearby civilians.<br/><br/>G does a great job of roleplaying Arselan's reaction.  "Andromeda?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Arian is free.  One guard is still under the influence, while the others are reeling and puking out their controllers.  She doesn't want to kill him, so she <i>(success)</i> strikes with the flat of the blade.  Unfortunately, Scourge is charged and glowing and <b>messy</b>, so she breaks the guy's nose and face, causing blood to spray and the guy to start screaming as the blow to the head (maybe with the sword's influence) causes him to puke out the mind control critter.<br/><br/>M sighs.  This sword\u2026<br/><br/>"I need my hand healed," she reminds the group.<br/><br/>Down at the gatehouse, Niff fires his lightning gun at the mysterious gun-wielder and <i>(crit!)</i> nails him in the chest with a perfectly placed bolt.  Because it's a crit, he gets his shot off before the other, and does a good amount of damage.  The lightning lifts the guy off his feet and hurls him back a good fifteen feet through the stable door with a crash of wood, leaving wisps of smoke trailing in his wake.<br/><br/>"Yesss!"  F does a reverse fist pump, elbow at his belly.  "Got him!"<br/><br/>As he starts for the stable, he gets into a brangle with a couple of townsfolk trying to grapple him.  He fights them off, but it's tricky. One of them is a kid, and he tries not to deal out too much damage.<br/><br/>Arselan <i>(success)</i> makes a Leadership roll to rally the newly liberated troops, then jumps off his horse. While Andromeda the Dude runs interference with the civilians trying to attack, he lays hands on two people to try a double Cure.<br/><br/>He fails, but I seize the opportunity since we're close to the end of the session.  In Arselan's mind, his goddess Ceridwen appears.  "I will grant you the boon you seek, but you must prove yourself by undertaking a task for me."<br/><br/>"I will," Arselan says without hesitation.  "Anything."<br/><br/>The goddess smiles.  <i>"Free the city."</i><br/><br/>She vanishes.  G's eyes widen.<br/><br/>The two people are cured, and I narrate the camera pulling back high over the gatehouse so we see the oncoming crowd filling the main street from the gatehouse all the way to the docks, as the population of the entire city begins to rush toward the gate, the lead elements breaking into a run, eyes wide, froth coming from their mouths.  They are several thousand strong, at least.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> The Better Part of Valor, or The Wall is Your Friend</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406344/#Comment_406344" name="Item_235" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T16:12:02+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  4:12PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I read over this, I'm struck (among other things, but this is what's hitting me now) by how tricky it is for me to keep track of Pets and what they're doing.

I'm hoping the gaming bug sticks so that when they're adults, they'll have so many epic war stories these will be far, far down on the stack.<br/><br/>John, that's a good idea, thankya.  I've been using 3x5 cards and am giving the Pets truncated stats, skills, and special abilities, and putting the onus on the player to run them.<br/><br/>Paul, that's a really good question.  None of them like to miss sessions, but if one or two can't come, we've soldiered on anyway in the interests of logistical continuity.  But we're actually dealing with that in a different way tomorrow, as G can't make it.  She's asked us to delay the story so Arselan can participate.  I'd left them on the brink of an epic confrontation with the mind flayers and a bunch of their allies and a party of controlled adventurers.  G was hoping for a delay because this quest is such a big deal for the paladin "to show what he can do," in her words.  I said yes, and M was curious about why the exception.  But nobody seems to be out of sorts.  This group is awesome in sportsmanship.  I don't know if it's a girl thing, to be honest.  They're definitely more mature than I was at their age.<br/><br/>So we're going to set up an alternate party using <i>World of Planarchs.</i>  This'll work well anyway, as A was talking about swapping out Andromeda and playing Fox for awhile.  With the older girls, an alternate group might be the way to go, and EM has been talking about converting her Faery's Tale character Shadowlock into WoDu anyway.  Fox will probably end up being a half-fox spirit, half humanoid breed.

Still trying to catch up with both groups, and then there was today's Planarch session, which was mostly chargen, but ended up with some nice scenes.  I could damn near make a part-time job out of playing and logging these kids' adventures.<br/><br/>The Dungeon Girls really liked the more open-ended style of Planarchs, in which it looks like the racial heritages may play a bit like FATE aspects.  It was interesting to see what they came up with.  They're also starting to discuss how to run their own games, as A in particular would love to play every week.  Elder Moppet suggested that any of them could learn to be a GM, but thought G and A would be particularly well-suited.  Poor A is over for a sleepover and pining to "dungeon."  Unfortunately, the moppets are more into social time just now than gaming.<br/><br/>And not to divert from the main narratives, but today we launched the new party with a half-Kitsune, half-Mechano-angel mechano-warrior (A), a Shadow-sprite survivor (S), a Demonic demon-hunter (F), a Stormblooded Elven witch (L), and a Draconic alchemist-wizard (M). That's a lot of hyphenated characters.  Borrowing from an awesome idea thread elsewhere on SG, they're a Special Errands Patrol for the Dis Planarchic Library.  Their first gig is to retrieve a particular scroll from the Far Elastrian Stacks, Row of the Brazen Oak, about an hour's travel from Main Desk Plaza.

Now the kids are mopping up and exploring the citadel, for which I have printed off a pre-gen map gleaned from the internets.  I have one thing in mind for today's session, mostly because I haven't had any time to prep: there's an orc wizard still at large in the keep, but he's (wisely) not going to come out into the open to be summarily whacked.  He has a Darkness-Poison spirit, a powerful Charm-Passage Demon, a Fire-Wolf spirit, and a Brutal-Stone spirit in his magical quiver.  The idea is to throw out some stealthy spirit attacks and see how the kids do with a cat and mouse game, but keep the Stone spirit and Fire spirit for more direct assaults.  And I have also placed some loot.  Otherwise the plan is to riff off the kids' actions.  That's worked pretty well so far.  The orc is in the central keep in a locked room where he's drawn his magical summoning circle and is currently pulling in the Demon, who looks like those old D&amp;D half-snake women with multiple arms.  Part of my notion is to hit the players with something that looks more like a Disney princess than a traditional monster and see how they react.<br/><br/>The kids do some exploring, searching for loot.  The boys take Romrama and Ingor to sift through the wrecked furniture and offal of the troll's lair, while the girls head toward the inner courtyard with their four characters, where they split again into Mist and Rhavaniel on the one hand, Amber and Lostariel on the other.<br/><br/>The kids are really squirrelly today, and it's hard to keep them on task, especially when they've split into two groups.  My patience is tested as I have to remind them more than a few times to quiet down so I can hear what the acting pair is saying.  This is an unavoidable piece of working with younger kids.  The older Dungeon Girls also need reminders from time to time, but not like the little ones.  I can't help but feel a bit like a Grinch, though.<br/><br/>I did take the time to place the loot at a few locations on the map, but the girls come to a larger building on the map that looks like a great hall or a large stable.  Lostariel listens, while Amber waits nearby.  Meanwhile, Mist and Rhavaniel enter the main keep, which requires them to access an upper door placed midway up the wall like a sally port.  They are headed toward the orc wizard's sanctum.<br/><br/>The boys resolutely refuse any hints that the troll's lair doesn't have anything worthwhile, and continue to dig through piles or wrecked furniture, etc.  In retrospect, I was too literal about the little prep I did.  I should have tossed in something for them to fight or loot.  I did have them make a couple of STR rolls to shift heavier bits of rubbish, but that's hardly exciting.  This counts as a Failure on my part.  Soon they decide to head over to join the girls.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the Amber/Lostariel pair arrive at the stable.  A WIS check <i>(partial success)</i> determines they hear something scratching inside.  I don't really know what's in there, but scratching seems interesting.  I'm curious to hear what they think about it--<br/><br/>"Another Frost Worm," JM declares with certainty.<br/><br/>"Ooh, that'd be cool!" says S.  "We could make a pet out of it!"<br/><br/>JM nods.  "The book says people ride Frost Worms.  We could ride it!"<br/><br/>A claps her hands.  "That'd be so cool!"<br/><br/>"Plus they're so cute!" JM adds.<br/><br/>"Having a Frost Worm as a pet would be awesome," C says.<br/><br/>I'm thinking, "A pet <i>Frost Worm?"</i>  The illustration shows a chalk white nightmare, a gigantic cross between a centipede and a maggot.  <i>Cute?</i><br/><br/>My daughter is odd.<br/><br/>But I'm going with it, where I wasn't as flexible with the boys.  Sure.  It's an awesome idea, not the usual thing you hear from adventuring parties.  When Romrama and Ingor arrive, the characters slip the bolt, look inside, and see\u2026there's a frost worm in there, alright, a smaller one about 15 feet long.  I describe it wheeling around to fix its multiple red insectoid eyes on them and hiss.<br/><br/>"Probably the baby of the one we killed."  JM shakes her head.  "It's probably lonely."<br/><br/>"We have to make friends with it," S muses.  "Maybe it would like some food?"<br/><br/>"We're out of steaks."<br/><br/>"Would it like some rations?"<br/><br/>OK, I cut in.  What are you going to do, Amber?  Lostariel?  Ingor?  Romrama?<br/><br/>JM says, "It's probably sad it lost its mommy."<br/><br/><del>Amber</del> Romrama walks up to the thing as it rushes up and raises its front half to loom over him, pincers quivering.  <del>Amber</del> The dwarf reaches out and <i>(crit on a CHA roll)</i> successfully befriends the damn thing.  It lowers itself as he rubs its hide over one eye.  S claps in delight.  A new pet!<br/><br/>Everyone is impressed.  "Cool!" C says.<br/><br/>J nods enthusiastically.  "Can we ride it?"<br/><br/>"First we have to feed it and name it," says JM.  "But everybody will get a chance to ride it."<br/><br/>C agrees.<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>Naming the Worm, More Orcish Skulduggery, and Mist in Stealth Mode</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406957/#Comment_406957" name="Item_246" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-22T14:28:57+00:00" title="February 22, 2013  2:28PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2013 5:51PM by Hexabolic.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and JM decided Amber's Sleep spirit is named <b>Bespenderay</b>, and that its second Domain is <i>Nightmare.</i>  Forgot to mention that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406974/#Comment_406974" name="Item_247" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-22T22:03:54+00:00" title="February 22, 2013 10:03PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who says you need to kill monsters and take their stuff?

I finally read my notes and talked with the kids, and so have some edits for the above piece.  Apologies, I left out quite a bit.  It was Romrama who befriended the worm, and I got Amber's sleep-nightmare spirit's name confused with Valavanora's kind cricket spirit.  *sigh*  That'll teach me to write from memory nearly two weeks after the session...<br/><br/>My hasty prep for the session included drawing three cards from the Paizo Harrow Deck: The Liar, The Crows, and The Sickness.  The first depicts a beautiful serpentine Naga woman, the second three crow-like thieves playing a game, and a plague victim cum zombie.<br/><br/>When I wrote the last stretch, I neglected to mention that Amber chose to multi-class as a Cleric when she leveled up to Level 3, and she is now a servant of the Goddess of Travelers, the Moon, and Hope.  At the start of the session, she takes Cure for her new Special Ability and promptly prays to her goddess for guidance.  The goddess <i>(Crit!)</i> answers.  Amber asks for help in destroying the castle.<br/><br/>"You will find a way," says the goddess.  "Build me a new temple free of the evil of this place."<br/><br/>"OK," says Amber.  "I will."<br/><br/>"Then you have my blessing in that undertaking."  <i>+1 Forward to actions going toward rebuilding the temple.</i><br/><br/>"Thanks," says Amber.  "Will you bless our water for us?"<br/><br/>The goddess smiles.  "I will.  And I leave you this warning.  Beware the crows.  And the liar."  She vanishes after blessing Amber's waterskin, turning the contents into holy water.<br/><br/><b>Back to the current continuity...</b><br/><br/>After some quick discussion, the kids decide to name the worm <b>Rattlebeetle</b>.  They proceed to feed it some of their dwindling rations, which it scarfs up quickly.<br/><br/>Mist and Rhavaniel enter the keep stealthily, though Rhavaniel does so with only partial success, and Mist rolls a crit.  They enter a vaulted room, at the other end of which they see a door, ajar with green light spilling around the edges.  They cross and Mist opens the door and slips inside, still riding her critical success.  Meanwhile, dark tentacles unfurl from the ceiling and coil around Rhavaniel!<br/><br/>Inside the door is a circular chamber, also vaulted.  The orc wizard is here, performing a ritual with a great summoning circle painted onto the floor.  The green light comes from a pair of braziers blazing with arcane flames.  I expected Mist to draw her Elven sword and go to town, but JM has a little smile on her face as she describes how Mist  hangs back in the shadows to observe.  I asked her later why she didn't simply cut him down, and she replied, "Mist wanted to see what he was doing."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rhavaniel is being pulled toward a circular maw filled with fangs that resemble wasp stingers.  She pulls out her bow and <i>(success)</i> launches an arrow into the thing, apparently without effect.  As it hauls her closer, she <i>(success on DEX)</i> drops the bow and pulls out her magical hunting spear in time to jam it into the maw and resist being drawn closer this round.  The spear does damage, but not enough to banish the spirit.  Rhavaniel's panther Madeleine circles frantically from below, unable to leap high enough to help.  Rhavaniel cries out for help, and <i>(crit)</i> gets the attention of the others outside.  Ingor, Lostariel, and Amber rush into the keep, while Romrama stays outside to guard the young Frost Worm, whom he has named <i>Rattlebeetle</i>.<br/><br/>Mist continues to watch the orc wizard.  In the summoning circle appears a half-woman, half-serpent demon.  You know the type: six arms, long hair, beautiful and deadly.  I describe the shimmering scales and the lazy, hissing voice as the demon and sorcerer exchange greetings.  The orc says, "I command you to..."<br/><br/>Finally, Mist acts.  She holds up her sword and grates, "I think that's a bad idea," in her best Batman voice.  She wants to make a CHA attack to intimidate, so she rolls a partial success.  The orc freezes and looks over his shoulder, afraid.  The sword Causes Fear, however, and the sorcerer freaks out, breaking the summoning circle.  The demon is released!  She utters a contemptuous laugh and fixes her hypnotic gaze on Mist, who <i>(Failure)</i> fails to resist--<br/><br/>"I have Lucky, Daddy!" JM says.  "I get to reroll!"<br/><br/>Damn it, so she does.  This time, perhaps distracted by the blue light emanating from her sword, Mist <i>(Success)</i> tears her gaze from the demon's.  The demon turns and sweeps out of the room, coils rasping on the floor, free and unbound.<br/><br/>The frightened orc swigs quicksilver and cries out for his Fire Wolf spirit.  A wolf made of crimson flames appears and launches itself at Mist in a blaze of fury!  I mime how the orc points desperately at Mist, hand shaking.<br/><br/>JM doesn't faze easily.  Mist charges the wolf, holding the Sword of Tirendel in a two-handed grip.  "Mist is going to chop that wolf spirit in half, Daddy!"<br/><br/>I'm so proud.  OK, honey, you go for it.<br/><br/>Mist leaps at the wolf and <i>(Crit!--without Awesome Points, I might add)</i> sweeps her sword through it in one mighty blow, dissipating the wolf in a burst of fire and landing unharmed a few steps away from the orc wizard, wisps of smoke trailing off her sleeves.  JM promptly jumps up to show off Mist's awesome victory pose.  I'm astonished--again--at her brute luck and nearly pitch-perfect sense of drama.<br/><br/>"That's so cool," says C.  I think we all agree.<br/><br/><i><b>Next:</b> More Spirit Fighting, a Four-Pack of Zombies, and Negotiating with Crows.</i><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein" title="Nifelhein"><img alt="Nifelhein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/888/nUG22UPKX7MJD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein">Nifelhein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407218/#Comment_407218" name="Item_249" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T13:11:28+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  1:11PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is pure gold, I have a lot of fun reading the posts and I can only hope to have something like this when my yet to be born children are ready for some tabletop action!

We last left them facing a city of possessed people, with Andromeda the Necromancer having had her spirit dumped into the body of a citizen while the possession spirit she'd summoned goes on a walkabout with her body.  Arselan the Paladin has been charged by his goddess Ceridwen to free the city.  The entire populace of the city seems bent on destroying them, and we start the session with this World War Z moment of onrushing, blank-eyed crowds.<br/><br/>Today we are missing M, who can't make it, so Arian and Scourge will be a bit in the background.  L and Elder Moppet are here, though, so we have a full complement of magic users.<br/><br/>Arian (an NPC this session) calls to them from her position on the wall, from where she can see the full extent of the danger.  The rest of the characters quickly head for the stair to join the ranger, accompanied by the score or so of guardsmen freed by Arselan and Andromeda.  There's some brief talk about running out the gate, but they conclude they can't shut the gate in time anyway.  So it's the wall.  Arselan's warhorse is there too, along with Hodari the lion and Dera the falcon.  The monkey is somewhere outside the wall, but nobody is too concerned about him.<br/><br/>After looking at the city map and asking the guards for advice, the party decides to make for the temple of Uru, a large, walled temple complex at the SE side of the city.  They start running along the wall, and the crowd starts in pursuit, but they're bottlenecked by the stair, so a number of the possessed citizens run through the streets parallel to the wall, a mob that tries to scale the wall when the players pause, and that starts up any stairs it encounters on the way.  Meanwhile, the pursuers on the wall are strung out far enough back to give the characters a decent lead.<br/><br/>The characters are flagging a bit from exertion, though everyone's made their CON rolls to this point.  Andromeda pauses, and A asks me if she can still work Necromancy in this body.<br/><br/>"Sure," I answer, grinning.  "Want to summon something?"<br/><br/>"No," Arselan declares.  "No spirits."  It reminds me of Darth Vader's line to Boba Fett: "No disintegrations."<br/><br/>"But\u2026" A affects a pout.  "I'm just trying to--"<br/><br/>"NO."  G is adamant. "Every time--every time!--you summon something, something goes wrong.  The last thing we need is more necromancy."<br/><br/>"OK\u2026!" A sighs and they party runs a bit longer, but the crowd is on the wall behind them now and closing, the citizens frothing as the force controlling them pushes them to their physical limits.j<br/><br/>Andromeda stops again.  "That's it!  I'm doing something.  Can I summon my spirit of Decay?"<br/><br/>"No, stop!" Arselan says.  "NO NECROMANCY!"<br/><br/>"We have to do something," A argues.<br/><br/>I roll a 4 on the Die of Fate and put the die on the table.  "You have four rounds--less than half a minute--before the crowd reaches you.<br/><br/>Arselan lines up the guards to make a shield wall, but the guards are freaked.  Arselan employes <i>(success)</i>  Leadership to firm up their morale.  "Try not to kill anyone," he concludes.<br/><br/>Andromeda calls her ghost--whose name I can't remember right now.  Since this is an allied spirit, she doesn't have to bargain.  She has the spirit decay a stretch of wall between the party and their pursuit.<br/><br/>"Hold it," G says.  "Arselan doesn't want anyone killed.  It's not their fault they're possessed."<br/><br/>"Not many people will be killed, but we have to do something," Andromeda counters.<br/><br/>"No killing," Arselan says, playing the paladin to the hilt.<br/><br/>"I can't guarantee no one will be killed."<br/><br/>I've ticked the countdown die down to 2 during this exchange.<br/><br/>"You have to make amends, then," says Arselan.  "If anyone's killed."<br/><br/>A rolls her eyes.  "Fine.  I'll make amends.  I'll serve the city until I've paid them back for anyone who dies because of me."<br/><br/>Tick countdown to 1.<br/><br/>"Swear?" says Arselan.<br/><br/>"Yes!"  With that, Andromeda unleashes her spirit and rolls boxcars for effect.<br/><br/>Tick to zero. The first wave of the pursuers slam into the guards, but they are hurled back, one guard falling off the wall in the process, to be torn apart by the crowd surging around below.  I describe how the people in the street are piling up against the wall, squirming over each other to try to climb up and reach the characters.<br/><br/>Adding Andromeda's INT to her FX roll of 12 for the spirit, something I'm trying out on marginal effect or damage boosts for spirit FX, I figure the effect covers a fifteen foot section of wall.  I describe how the stone turns a sickly gray and collapses into a pebbly sludge, tearing away loose stones in its wake to spread it out another few feet.  It takes a bunch of the mind-controlled with it, and other runners blindly plunge into it without heed, until the controlling entity appears to take notice.  The wall pursuers draw to a halt and stare across the gap at the players, chests heaving, foam flecking their mouths.  A few collapse from exhaustion.<br/><br/>As a post-script, the slurry of decayed stone buries another dozen or more people in the street below.  An eerie silence falls over the scene except for the occasional stray pebble falling.<br/><br/>"Ohhh yeahhh, I'm doing penance."  A sighs.  Everyone around the table stifles hilarity.<br/><br/>"Told you," G says.  <i>"Necromancy."</i><br/><br/>"Come on!" says Niff.  "Let's get moving!"<br/><br/><i><b>Next: </b>Temples and Tunnels!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408861/#Comment_408861" name="Item_253" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T17:22:14+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  5:22PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

It's a classic argument I've seen in a ton of games over the years, but it was fun to see it pop up in this group, all fresh and new for them.<br/><br/>Niff was pretty much "let the chips fall where they may," but the rest of the group has gotten a bit gunshy (bowshy?) about necromancy, given A's proclivity for dramatic bargains and, y'know, <i>necromancy.</i>  Put another way, they've come to the notion that such dark magics inevitably bring collateral damage.
