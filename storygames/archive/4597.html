Then when my face was rubbed in it, I couldn't help but admit it.<br/><br/>The game stalls if the players blow their investigative rolls and fail to get the clues.  Then you have to resort to dice tricks or illusionism to get the game going again.  That makes me sad.<br/><br/>Now, after a generous research grant and the loss of several lab assistants, here's what I've come up with:  When the player blows an investigation roll, the GM still gives him the clue, but he puts a doom token in the bowl.  Later when the player succeeds at a roll that the GM thinks would be more interesting/scary if he failed, the GM announces that the player failed and takes the doom token out of the bowl.  Note that the character still has to go to the newspaper office to get the newspaper clipping clue.<br/><br/>Is that too jarring?  Is it too much to accept that the results of the earlier roll can influence a later, unrelated roll, or can it work for you in some sort of karmic-balance thing where a vital success is balanced out by an unfortunate failure?  I still want to make sure the player has a reason to put points into investigative skills, something he wouldn't be as inclined to do if he knew he would get all the clues in any case.  <br/><br/>I wouldn't use this to kill a player and probably wouldn't cancel out a critical, but would instead try to use it as another tool to ramp up the tension.  I imagine a bowl full of doom tokens would be a scary thing.<br/><br/>I'm only pretending that I thought this up--role-playing, if you will.  I'm sure I'm mostly just lifting it from other places--Roanoke comes to mind.  I may have even mentioned the idea before, but my memory isn't the same since Jason Morningstar showed me how to sniff glue.<br/><br/>So, for those of you who enjoy investigative-type games, do you think this would work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103990/#Comment_103990" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-20T21:05:06+00:00" title="October 20, 2007  9:05PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...

I can sort of see a version where it's not obvious which rolls have consequences for failure (but it's all the rolls that move the plot forward if you succeed) but that each time you fail one the plot token still gets handed out, but some kind of Doom accumulates so that when things do go bad, they go worse in proportion to how much Doom you have accumulated.<br/><br/>I have a couple of caveats. One is that in my experience, many horror players are there not for the fun of making a Lovecraftian story, but for the creepy thrill of experiencing it. As such, they often place a high value on their immersion, and are highly resistant to any mechanics that interfere with it. Resource management can be particularly problematic. The other is the obvious objection: if the PCs need to find the newspaper clue and are in the newspaper office searching for it, why on earth are we making them roll for it in the first place?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104015/#Comment_104015" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T07:54:16+00:00" title="October 21, 2007  7:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Shane: I dunno if I was clear at first, but I meant to say that when a player fails a roll, she will succeed.

That is very much like a "here are the clues, make your skill checks to learn more" approach.<br/><br/>That approach can be used for any investigate style story if players buy into "this is the story where we uncover the dark truth, all that's in doubt is if we uncover the deeper layers of it, rescue those to be rescued and/or die or not".<br/><br/>In this sense, clues as connectors between scenes become like "doors" in a old style dungeon.  You always find them, the issue is how long to locate them (when a clock is ticking), which/what order to follow them, do you get through them "quickly" (surprising what's waiting) or "slowly" (not surprising) or only by using up resources (spells), and whether they are "trapped" (hazardous to negotiate).  The secret door is a short cut, you can still get to what it conceals by a "long way around" or it is to something "optional".<br/><br/>The important part of the metaphor for me is that there are, in good dungeons, choices of doors not just a linear line of them, and some means of making choices about the doors.  A "clue based" adventure that is A leads to B leads to C is like a set of three rooms on a straight line in a dungeon - minimal player choice (GM wrote the plot).<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104033/#Comment_104033" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T11:26:18+00:00" title="October 21, 2007 11:26AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2007 11:28AM by John_Harper.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the dungeon metaphor a lot.

When you're in a library for a day, and there are five things you might discover, of varying degrees of obscurity, pass/fail is not the ideal system to use.

The "red herring" is the equivalent of the faked door with a trap.  Players usually manufacture their own "clues" and theories fast and furious as well.<br><br>Applying the metaphor again, I think in using the "red herring" one has to be careful not to lead to a large wasted investment.  While realistic in a simulationist sense it's boring to play out.  The nice thing about the fake trapped door is that "BANG" there's the pain for making bad choice, botching relevant skill checks, but it's done and now we're back to useful choices.  I think the red herring needs to be resolved similarly, or else have other relevant PC goals embedded in it (e.g., if the game includes both other and inner conflicts, if there are character flags in use, the red herring doesn't get you closer to stopping the cultists summoning whatever in the outer conflict, but it does hit some character flags in the inner conflict).  Otherwise just flash forward the way a serial killer drama does, we skip to finding next body and "guess that theory was wrong" (rather like the fate of Mr. Smithers above).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104061/#Comment_104061" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T15:34:20+00:00" title="October 21, 2007  3:34PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Gumshoe sounds interesting.

I've only read Fear Itself, and that rather briefly, but I see no reason why clues that are available to anyone or  to someone who has the right ability shouldn't be red herrings. Certain other clues are only available to PCs with the right ability who are prepared to spend points from their pool. Making those clues red herrings might be considered foul play, but that's maybe more a matter of social contract than game system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104063/#Comment_104063" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T16:01:56+00:00" title="October 21, 2007  4:01PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another option is to make scenarios a bit more 'realistic' (oh noes, that word! ack!)

Just like knocking open a possibly trapped chest with a hammer or sawing through it are valid tactics in old-skool D&amp;D, various forms of described examination of evidence and locations and lateral thinking (looking for other witnesses, using bribery/blackmail/fasttalk/intimidation as necessary are valid tactics in CoC.<br/><br/>Hell, going back and confronting a witness/suspect with new evidence or theories or re-examining evidence based on new stuff are valid approaches as well. It's sort of like the "Let it ride" concept in reverse.<br/><br/>As for cheats? Illusionism?<br/><br/>Personally, I don't worry about it. Seriously. My approach is that players come into a CoC scenario knowing that the main thrust of the game is to gather as much info as possible to arm themselves for a final confrontation of some sort. They are almost certainly working under some sort of time constraint, as well a some sorts of societal constraints generally. The players will need to use their brains in a very real way, and their characters' stats/skills will aid them in this.<br/><br/>Generally, resources will be used up along the way, possbily including the lives of a few of the investigators and/or their grip on reality.

As I see it in these kind of systems, you find the journal and roll your Latin Journal reading skill. You're guaranteed some informatio, which moves the game forward, then you get more detail depending upon how well you did. When I heard that I wanted to smack my own forhead. I had played (and run) so many games where failed observation rolls resulted in enormous amount of not-fun. Its just so obvious. Give them some info regardless and give them more details depending upon how well they do.

Fail the spot hidden; OK sure, you've spotted the photo on the wall, but you haven't spotted the guy hiding behind the door who now gets a free go at hitting you on the head. Giving them an 'achievement' for failing at least makes the roll have some meaning. <br/><br/>As for climb rolls or some such, I would take a first fail to mean that you realise this is going to be really hard - you can roll again but if you fail this time you're going to really hurt yourself. It ups the ante and gives them an informed choice. I'd be tempted to take library use rolls in the same direction. You failed the roll - you discover the info you want is in the restricted section - how are you going to get it? Theft, deception, bribery? Any of those can lead to some interesting escalations. Of course if it's a chokepoint they need to get the essential leads, that should go without saying. But and essential lead is like 'a little knowledge', and we all know what that can be  ;-)<br/><br/>As for Gumshoe, I've playtested the 'Fear itself' version. Yes you can automatically get the clues if the PCs with the right skills go to the right location and spend the points. Otherwise, you know what, the GM is advised to place the clues elsewhere. Hmmm, isn't that the same fault that people aim at CoC, namely illusionism? For a system built on the promise of fixing the missed clue problem I felt that Gumshoe completely missed the mark. Yes it will handle it, but only in the same way as CoC handles it, by giving the players second chances until the get the info.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104120/#Comment_104120" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T07:13:12+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  7:13AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you sure it's illusionism?

Perhaps it helped that I tended to use modified modules, so I didn't really have any attachment to the "story" as a GM. As a player, I played for the experience of getting into character. If anything being somewhat or hopelessly confused about what was really going on jacked up the intensity for me. It scales up the theme of sacrifice. It's one thing to take great risks to Defend Mankind when you have a Plan That Might Just Work; it's in some ways more intense to take great risks to Defend Mankind when you Have No Friggen Clue What's Going On. <br/><br/>Now I WOULD hand out clues after everyone was dead or the adventure was completely resolved so they'd know what "really" happened. But again, the story didn't really matter to me. The details of the mystery are just... "color."  <br/><br/>I guess one thing to be clear on, players might miss a clue that almost surely leads to an inevitable total party kill later, or at least TPK unless the players get really creative. If they missed that clue... then that's what happens.  But usually the TPK doesn't happen until the end of the session. To me this is not a problem, especially when I'm a player.

In CoC, the general idea is that the skills are based on SN:AFU, not optimal situations. That's one of the reasons that the rulebooks suggest not throwing in negative modifiers except in truly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely </span>dire situations.<br/><br/>Honestly, you can jump ahead with this even in combat. You've got some tentacled horror menacing the protagonists? Do you care if they make the hit roll or not? I mean, the non-Euclidian matter that forms the creature's hide will reduce it all to minimum anyway. Let 'em just go ahead and go straight to damage.<br/><br/>"Say Yes, or roll the dice"<br/>Is there any interesting outcome that people will care about if the roll should be blown? There isn't?  Fine, say "Yes" and move along. Wait, there is a possibly interesting outcome for failure? Okay, let's go to...<br/><br/>"Stakes-setting"/Outcome-setting.<br/>What is likely to happen on a failure? Are we going with game-universe/genre verite/reality simulation? This is the one where wasted time or resources comes from on failure.

He's got a professor buddy/museum assitant girlfriend/postal worker trivia buff drinking buddy who can translate it for him: Go to scene cutting/scene-framing, then back to the action.<br/><br/>Shane, I actually think your idea is pretty clever, so I'm sorry for side-tracking this so badly. It's just that I've heard a ton of arguments over time that CoC is broken and unplayable due to the Blown Bottleneck Roll issue, and honestly, I think it's a wee bit silly the lengths folks will go to to argue that it exists and is inherently terminal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104134/#Comment_104134" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T08:47:13+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  8:47AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh ... new toss-away thought:  How about the roll isn't about whether or not they find out the things they <i>should</i> know.

Gumshoe aims to solve the "failed roll" problem of Cthulhu, whereby a failed roll leads to a missed clue, by using point spends instead. There's not much doubt it does that, surely?<br/><br/>And how do you mean "giving players second chances until they get the info"? They spend a point and get the clue: surely there's no concept of a second chance?<br/><br/>Graham</blockquote>\nMaybe they changed things in the final edition. The version I read (as I said, a playtest) stated that the players only need spend a point to get the info. All well and good. BUT. The player character has to have the appropriate skill in that scene to be able to spend the point. Again, this is covered as Chargen demands that the group of PCs cover all the skills among them. The GM is directed to place clues and the criteria for acquiring them in to set places / scenes in the writing of a scenario. This presents the possibility that the PC with the required skill may not be present at the scene (should the PCs split up God forbid!) and thus the players cannot gain the clue. This is where, in the game text, instructions were given for the GM to move the clue elsewhere to ensure the players get it - ie second chances AKA fudging it.<br/><br/>Now I've no problem with that approach (ie fudging it) necessarily and have used it plenty of times myself. It's not my preferred method. Both CoC and Gumshoe (unless it's changed) use this approach at times. My complaint is that Gumshoe set the avoidance of this perceived pitfall as it's prime directive and criticised CoC for the very thing that it also suffers from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104497/#Comment_104497" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T03:25:18+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  3:25AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Oh ... new toss-away thought:  How about the roll isn't about whether or not they find out the things they<em>should</em>know.

I think that could be very appropriate in some situations and I could give the player a choice: take a doom token or lose 1d6 sanity.  Thanks Tony!<br/><br/>Maybe one thing that's important to stress is how I would present this to players:  I'm basically giving them the option to trade a failure now for a future success (or some sanity points where appropriate).  If players aren't cool with that, then they will just miss out on some clues.  Next time I run Cthulhu I'll try it as experiment.  Speaking for myself, as a player I would want all the clues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104515/#Comment_104515" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T05:58:21+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  5:58AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Making Sanity a resource completely in the player's control would be really cool.
