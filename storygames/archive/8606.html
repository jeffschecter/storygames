I think it was a lovely piece of writing and Graham deserves a Booker or some such prize.<br/><br/>I think that there is more to say on the subject and I was wondering if you would like to try your hand at it? Kingdoms of the Heartbroken is a foursquare "fantasy-heart-breaker" Fantasy world, Evil Empire, Fighters and Wizards that kind of crap.  I want you to write a bit of advice using the same advice I gave Graham " I am looking for something that would make people feel stupid for bothering to read the section but make them aware of the need to think about what they are doing." You know you want to try.  Graham did it it can't be that hard.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190773/#Comment_190773" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-01T09:59:13+00:00" title="February  1, 2009  9:59AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2009 10:06AM by James_Mullen.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just run 10 games in 10 consecutive blocks at Conception, come home on a 3 hour drive and drunk a bottle of wine, so YES, I am ready to have a go at this, (though I don't know if I can manage 500 words):<br/>\n<br/>\n"What Is A Roleplaying Game?"<br/>\n<br/>\nJesus... are you screwing with me? I mean seriously, what is this? Was this book not shrink wrapped or anything? Are you really saying you picked this up on the basis of the fucking ARTWORK on the front cover thinking it was some 'vampires &amp; teenage girls' romance shit? I don't even get a PER CENTAGE of that artwork! For the LOVE of God, what sort of MUTANT are you!? Tell me, brother, why did you lay down your hard earned bread on this if you REALLY had no idea what the fuck roleplaying is? Jesus Suffering Fuck, what were you THINKING? I mean, I've been stung, I picked up 'Passages' because my brain didn't register the fact that it was fucking D20, but I knew it was a fucking GAME! GET YOUR ASS OUT OF HERE! You are one Grade A, First Class piece of freakery. You are making me feel dirty just by holding this. I mean it. I don't know who you are or what your situation is, but I just feel like I need a shower. Hey, I think I saw a Boris Vallejo book over there, why not just get an exchange for that? What? "Who is...?" Oh man. Oh no, do not say that man, I am on a short fuse here. That is IT. I am coming for you. No, seriously, stay RIGHT where you are, I am going to find you and make you regret that you were born. That I was born. Whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think? Too angry? :D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
