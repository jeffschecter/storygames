In a lot of new wave games you can get a reward beforehand to use when you are taking that risk. TSOY/Solar kind of sits on that line.

Looking at it in those terms, I think the key difference between these games is that Burning Wheel doesn't seem to facilitate such a dramatic rising power curve as Solar System does - the whole point of Solar System is that your character is thrust into key positions that allow him to make important choices, simply because he grows more powerful pretty quickly, and perhaps even more importantly, because in the Solar System everybody matters.<br/><br/>I don't have enough experience with Burning Wheel to say for sure, but to me it seems that the game is explicitly built to preserve a certain sort of conservative power curve over long term. Characters are intended to grow influential and powerful, even awe-inspiring, but they do not wield the sort of power Solar System bestows upon even the least significant player characters. Solar System moments are often made out of characters just going completely zany and breaking all expectations for what they should be capable of, while it seems to me that BW does a lot of work to ensure that all results are reasonable and fit well into a matrix of choice and consequence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170897/#Comment_170897" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T09:01:39+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  9:01AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>I've been reading both of these, and while the difference in implementation is clear to me, I'm wondering where the difference in intent is.

Burning Wheel gives Persona Artha for finishing a Belief.<br/><br/>BW has cogs in its machine that don't turn until you have played a long time, where TSoY's entire machine (chargen to Transcendence), to my eyes, will run in a few months of play at most.  This is not to say that TSoY has no long-term capabilities, only that BW is more set up with long term play in mind.  An epiphany isn't going to happen without a whole lotta play behind it.<br/><br/>Hope that makes sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170926/#Comment_170926" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T10:26:40+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 10:26AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Judd,<br/><br/>You implied a few posts up that you had some further thoughts on how SS and BW were different.

With Burning Wheel, I feel the actual playing of the games forges who my character is. I'm often surprised who my character becomes through logical progression. I also feel the mechanics of Burning Wheel inspire immersions and deep roleplaying for me. Duel of Wits really pushes team work. But the Refreshment Scenes in tSoY are out of this world. But burning wheel has much more built in situation generation. <br/><br/>In play, I don't find either game similar at all. Especially in terms of how characters work together. tSoY feels much more light hearted and over the top action oriented to me with few consequences. That being said the difference in character skills is much less forgiving in tSoY.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
