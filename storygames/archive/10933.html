They all seem to be filled with tables and complex little formulae that make them highly unapproachable for new players. Intricate little character development options that would give the most hardened min-maxer option paralysis...and in a few cases you'll spend half an hour developing a character who isn't quote fully realised only to be told that "your character will develop further in play"...that's if you don't get killed because your character is seriously underpowered to go adventuring until they've gained a bit of experience...and the only way to gain experience is to go adventuring and kill stuff...catch-22, no???<br/><br/>I'm wondering if the concept of boffer LARPing and story games are mutually incompatible.<br/><br/>Surely not.<br/><br/>Surely someone can point me in the right direction.<br/><br/>Otherwise I've got a lot of designing ahead of me.<br/><br/><span style="color: #FF0000;">V</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242516/#Comment_242516" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T02:10:55+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  2:10AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think in the UK (and Europe as a whole) we have quite a difference in how LRPs work so you could try looking at them (I could be wrong, I don't know much about american LRPs)...<br/><a href="http://www.lorientrust.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lorientrust.com/</a><br/><a href="http://www.curiouspastimes.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.curiouspastimes.co.uk/</a><br/><a href="http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/</a><br/>...are some of the main ones.

(OR RISK EPIC FRUSTRATION.)</blockquote>Of course, as with rpgs there are a couple of different cultures in LARPing, with euopean style boffer being pretty different from, for example, Vampire Larps, which are again very different from strangely artistic oneshot larps that seem to happen in the scandinavic countries.<br/><br/>That said, at least in the european boffer scene I'm most familiar, the biggest issue with anything involving mechanical change is the strong current of "system doesn't matter". Most larpers I know consider the rules to be unimportant (despite there being dozens of pages of them) and put "roleplaying/acting" on the pedestral, which tends to lead to a design culture where, well, the rules don't matter, instead relying on unwritten assumptions generally learned only through play. Add the extremely strong social aspects to it (It doesn't matter how many, dunno, hit points that NPC has if it's the GMs favorite character and he won't let that guy get killed.) and it's not surprising that boffer rules often look the way they do.<br/><br/>This was actually the main reason I stopped larping: What I wanted and what the other people seemed to want where radically different. I came from an rpg school of thought that said System Matters and that it should support what you want out of the game. Confronted with the local boffer scene, this just doesn't work short of writing and running my own game, complete with handpicked players, which just wasn't worth it for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242547/#Comment_242547" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T07:18:07+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  7:18AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to understand about LARP, boffer or no, is that there is a significant proportion of players for whom the point of the activity is to have a socially acceptable venue in which to dress up in funny clothes and show off.

So true.<br/><br/>I had a great conversation with Jeff Lower on a ride back from GenCon one year, about boffer larps.  There are some fascinating issues that arise from the structure of the game. Frex, when a larp weekend revolves around folks waiting in a tavern to be chosen to go on missions, there are some patterns that may arise.  Folks playing these games will often have encountered every crazy thing in the book that could possibly come up that way. So you get all kinds of escalation since you are trying to vary a repetitive pattern. And also, new folks have a hard time getting involved with more meaty plots, since people will self-select by writing plots for people they know, looking for people they know will show up and that are reliably strong players.  <br/><br/>But then, getting involved just seems trickier in ongoing larps. There is a lot more buy in involved on the part of the newb and the existing cast.  An issue of the form.<br/><br/>Another thing about larps, damn they take a lot of time to set up and run.  I chatted with some folks from Canada who said it's common for organizers to spend 20-40 hrs a month getting ready for the next session for monthly larps.  Processing reports of what happened, setting up new events to follow through. I am certain this must vary, I'm not sure what the standard is for Mind's Eye Theatre larps.  <br/><br/>But that is the part that seemed like it would benefit from having some kind of game structure to use.  Running a quick game that helped folks flesh out a story structure to run in the larp seems like it would be a natural fit. Doing something like a skim/paraphrasing game of PtA, for example, to get some key events to bring into the game. Something that could be updated easily, using flags and simple narrative description tags that get added too or changed as the characters changed. <br/><br/>But, it is a whole 'nother form. And varies considerably. It's really fascinating what goes into them. The scholarship from Europe about the structures is in-depth and fascinating, but I'd really like to see some rigorous, experience based analysis of larps of various types based on our community's way of looking at games. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.liveforum.dk/kp07book/older.php" rel="nofollow">Links to international articles about larp from the Nodal Point conventions. </a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242561/#Comment_242561" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T08:16:27+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  8:16AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me and Dev's mutual friend Eben in Boston is a former boffer larp organizer and regular at SGBoston.

If you've played HERO, you know GLASS's character creation process.<br/><br/>The principle "tip of the hat" I give to story games is with the Player Priority rules, in which your PC can't be killed unless you Commit, which grants a full Health and Innate Armor recovery. Afterward, for 15 minutes minus your current Psyche, if you go to 0 Health again, you're gone, dead, kaput. The point is that PCs die only when the situation warrants it in their players' eyes, not due to random damage or gleeful killing blows from rivals. I'll be the first to admit, however, that GLASS is a simulationist system at the core, with no ways to mechanically address Theme.<br/><br/>You might want to look at <a href="http://www.grapevinelarp.com/EndsAndMeans/" rel="nofollow">Ends and Means</a> for a more "storyified" system for LARPs, but I don't think it addresses actual combat with boffers. In fact, I think you might be facing an abashed design goal:<br/>* Boffer and Airsoft play is heavy on what I call "DO play": actual player skill takes precedence over mechanical efficacy. These rules often go by the Design What Doesn't Matter (DWDM) approach to rules: if you can do it--and mostly what happens at games is stuff you CAN do--then there's no rules for it. Rather, the rules handle edge cases and things too costly or dangerous to Really DO (GLASS takes this approach, but softened to enable some fantastic capabilities).<br/>* A "story game" LARP would be built with actual mechanics to drive elements of the action--what are often called "soft skills" and what I call "STAT play." They are very much on Design What Matters (DWM): providing rules and mechanics that enable favored player actions and directly drive story elements. If you see "Seduction" or "Persuasion" as PvP skills, you're in STAT play and, probably, closer to Story Now than otherwise.<br/><br/>But you see the inherent conflict? DWDM pushes all the "story mechanics" out of the rule book--DO it, don't talk about it and wave your character sheet around! Go and try to seduce the person or persuade them; don't expect some "Mind" stat to drive another PC to act how you want. [Disclaimer: I have added a Compel Ability to GLASS under advisement from GMs who insist that some games need a mechanical crowbar to get PCs to do anything cooperative.] But that aside, how can one make a system that gives "Plot Points" (or whatever) to players, to shape Theme and get at Story Now, and yet ALSO allows someone to bash another player into unconsciousness or even death without any "critical story need" behind it?<br/><br/>DO play makes elements of story emergent; STAT play gives handles to drive and enforce story elements. Marry those agendas, and I'll be impressed.<br/><br/>[If you'd like help tuning GLASS to suit the play your friend is seeking, hit me up at GLASScutters.org... the site's slow for now--still in (stalled) Golden Master playtesting--but I check daily for new posts and am happy to give advice for setting up Game Types, for designing Templates and Packages to make it easier for players to "pick list" PCs rather than "hand craft" them, and even for adding "bolt-on" modules to model things GLASS would normally leave to be DOne (e.g. a resource system used to drive a regional conflict metagame).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242583/#Comment_242583" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T10:41:56+00:00" title="November 18, 2009 10:41AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael, you're expressing concern over the approachability to new players. I'd like to add a hopefully rational viewpoint to that particular problem.<br/><br/>I have never been heavily entrenched in the LARP scene but from what I gathered from discussing it with friends, there are quite a few similarities between it and the MUSH/MUX scene. One of those aspects are approachability and advancement, which basically boils down to trust.<br/><br/>A LARP (or MU*) where most players drift in and out is simply not as good as one with a fairly static membership. It's hard to get any good intrigues moving when you don't know if your compatriots and enemies will be there next month. As Emily mentioned, it's also hard to write plots when you can't be sure if someone is going to be present, or how they will react. Will they do something utterly stupid and screw everything up? Will they miss your plot completely? Will they decide to forgo it in favour of chatting up some dude/chick all night? There's definitely overlap between this and the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10872" rel="nofollow">Diplomacy thread</a> with regards to how the game gets better as you get to know the players through repeat play.<br/><br/>So how do you ensure that the LARP or MU* is approachable while also ensuring a solid core membership? The way I've typically experienced and seen this being done is through limiting the amount of impact new players can have on the play of others', until they have proven themselves through time and successful play. One typical way of limiting that impact is through limiting the power level of the character, thereby limiting their options in interacting with the world and the plot, or at least minimizing the amount of damage they can do. Another method is system-enforced high lethality among "younger" characters, discouraging the aspirant from engaging with the system components until they have proven themselves and thus beefed up.<br/><br/>In the MU* world there were two popular approaches:<br/><br/>* Fully open character generation of a by-the-book low-power character, occasionally gimped further by house rules. Experience points awarded based on duration of stay/play (not always the same thing) and by popular vote by the people you play with and/or the MU* owners.<br/><br/>* Totally closed character generation with a rigorous application process, frequently involving writing intricate background stories weaving your character into MU*-specific lore, thereby proving you've been paying attention to the fluff and that you're literate. The actual statistics would frequently be assigned to you by the MU* owners in accordance with the degree of trust your application conferred. Experience points awarded arbitrarily based on plot achievements and not as coveted as on the fully open chargen MU*s.<br/><br/>I <i>think</i> that both of these approaches are used in LARPs today as well. I can understand the frustration of new players, having to wait for 6 months to several years to be fully accepted into the inner circle and trusted with plot, but I can also understand the apprehension on part of plot writers and owners to grant heroic-level characters to every unreliable loonie able and willing to put up $20.<br/><br/>It might be interesting, in the context of boffer LARPs, to consider not so much what Story Games did for RPGs but what 4E did for DnD. 4E does allow players to take on the personas of heroic-level characters pretty much right away, but it seems to me the reason this works is because the gameplay is very focused, with little opportunity for the players to engage in activities the DM doesn't want them engaging in. This is an approach I might consider fruitful to make boffer LARPs more appealing for new players, but (as 4E) it might well scare off many a LARPer who enjoys their immersion and complete free will gosh darnit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242589/#Comment_242589" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T11:17:51+00:00" title="November 18, 2009 11:17AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            New vs. vet player issues are pretty complex. But most LARPs I've played in handled that with a sort of "two-speed" approach to organizing:<br/>* Open, scalable encounters and events that relate to the "Big Plot" but aren't key information sources or strategic encounters. These let new players learn the system, become involved with the larger plots, and have something to act out/talk about in non-conflict situations; but none of them are somehow "key" to the playing out of the Big Plot.<br/>* The principle Big Plot which engages more with the veteran players, and which requires hooks into their PCs or background or other aspects to convey the situation. Often, these encounters are scaled up to "higher level PCs" in games where Exp awards can cause a large relative disparity in efficacy between PCs.<br/><br/>This sort of two-speed game prep is easy with task-based game play, simulation of conflicts (i.e. boffer), and a reliance on emergent stories (i.e. the players generate more "plot" for themselves than the organizers ever could). I'd be hard pressed to imagine a two-speed Story Now system that addressed Theme. What? Petty themes for potentially unreliable players (i.e. new) while the Major Themes are played out by the vets? At least in "normal" boffer LARP, even a total newbie can do something to affect a battle or help in an encounter or with a puzzle; in a theme-driven game, you'd almost HAVE to make separate sandboxes, if you had trust issues with the newbies (and you'd be wise to do so, unless you have a recommendation, application, and interview process for new players).<br/><br/>Really, there's two threads emerging, here: one about how to "storyify" a boffer game and one about how to deal with low-trust new players in any system that grants a lot of control (be it "able to kill other PCs" control or "able to dictate plot facts" control). We've had several threads about the latter, at RPG.net and Shade's--no Exp systems, fixed Exp system, Exp scaling systems, multi-speed game communities, freeform fiat for all--and it often just comes down to taste and the maturity level of your player base. Folks with a big "My Guy Rocks" bent are going to want rules against deprotagonization and/or for niche protection, ways to Rock More, chances to show How Much I Rock, and social (even OOC) rewards for Rocking. Folks with a big "It's About The Story" bent will want rules to be able to control or subvert other PCs (and won't mind them used on their own PC), lots of ways to inject color (or even narrative fact) into what's going on around them, and even a certain protection against randomness or trivialization (which is not the same as deprotagonization!).<br/><br/>The former play NERO (or GLASS), the latter play Mage (or Ends and Means).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242596/#Comment_242596" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T12:03:43+00:00" title="November 18, 2009 12:03PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not terribly familiar with boffer larps, I suppose I always assumed they lay half-way between SCA-style heavy weapons and non-physical traditional larps. However on the later end I've been aware of some folks investigating using Story Now techniques to try to improve the play experience. I've also done some design of my own in that area, based on significant play and organization experience with non-boffer traditional larps.<br/><br/>The way I see it, boffer or not, larps could significantly benefit from increasing player agency and reducing organizer effort and plot "railroadiness". The key problem, from my perspective, is that in typical story games there is no need to make your mechanical solutions scalable. In larp the scalability is almost exclusively produced by the intervention of more and more organizer effort (usually from more and more organizers). But this dependency needs to be broken to make a genuinely story game larp system, and not just a story game which involves acting and dress up (or even hitting people with boffer weapons). <br/><br/>This makes it a new frontier, not simply a natural extension of existing techniques.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242606/#Comment_242606" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T13:19:31+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  1:19PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2009 1:20PM by lachek.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel, I know of efforts to merge select LARP techniques with tabletop play, particularly in the freeform and jeepform traditions, but I'm unfamiliar with Story Now methods being used in LARPs. Can you elaborate, in this or another thread?<br/><br/>As I see it the two are almost mutually exclusive (though I hope to be proven wrong). Most techniques resulting in Story Now play involve re-apportioning of narrative authority away from a central GM figure into system elements, player participants, or both. The only reason this works, as far as I can see, is because everyone are sitting around the same table and observing the narrative taking shape, nodding and agreeing that it is true. As I know them, LARPs are less localized and therefore more reliant on figures of narrative authority to arbitrate and communicate what is real and true to the players.<br/><br/>The issue of new or otherwise untrusted players also reach new heights when we discuss granting them some level of narrative authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242611/#Comment_242611" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T13:41:31+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  1:41PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Narrative authority is in LARPs; Mage is all about that, if played by the oMET rule book.<br/><br/>You even get limited authority in boffer LARPs, though it's often merely colorful: you can design a race in the world and, through that, its general history and stereotypes; you can define a realm (in particular, when the game's focus in on rulers); I've even seen games where characters of rank could establish "towns," including NPC (non-present) citizenry, having use of the large longhouse cabin in a camp site, and controlling who else is permitted to stay in the surrounding normal cabins in the site (barring issues of large crowds demanding space regardless of "factions"). And it's VERY common for PCs with crafting skills to do things like set values for goods and, thereby, drive most of the in-game economy (which is why GLASS doesn't even HAVE rules for currency--let the players handle it themselves; it's more fun!).<br/><br/>At the Mage extreme, the key factors for narrative control are range of effect and communication. Most often, the smaller the range of effect for a world or setting change, the less you need to engage the organizers/GMs. Conversely, the more your change could impact the world as a whole, the more you have to contact a GM, have him or her communicate it to other GMs (often by walkie talkie), and eventually adjust any game state documents (online, in the central meeting place/office, wherever). So a minor, colorful change to the immediate area need only be "policed" by the other PCs in that area, and can be "forgotten" once it's of no immediate applicability. A major change of a game-spanning group or physical law requires notifying all GMs and players, and usually takes more time to really "sink in" as a permanent effect, the better to give time to disseminate the state change and (for GMs to) make adjustments to ongoing effects, plot lines, or NPCs.<br/><br/>In short... you can LARP anything that you can tabletop, with adequate communications and time to disseminate. Including narrative authority. And a LOT of narrative control is, on the grand scale, irrelevant or trivial, and as such need not be communicated beyond the immediate players and environs.<br/><br/>Trust in narrative games is only exacerbated by this communication issue; otherwise, any game with such control has checks and balances in the hands of others. Trust is EASIER, then, to apportion in a narrative-control mechanic, because of the mass communication requirement and, thus, number of opportunities for push-back (or outright veto). Trust in a self-enforcing, task-driven, micro-resource game (like a lot of boffer LARPs that use mana or charges) is much harder to apportion, because of the myriad ways to cheat in minor ways.... but the relative concern about cheating is mitigated by the micro-scale of the results one person can get from each instance of cheating (e.g. ignore a single wound in a flurry of blows; use a three-times-a-day ability four times a day; not have the skill level necessary to bypass a threshold check, but do so anyway).<br/><br/>So, like, I think you have it backwards, Mikael, on both the issues of "narration control takes even more trust" and "you can do more narration control at a table than in a far-flung LARP venue." But, het, that's why it's a discussion and not a chorus line! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242614/#Comment_242614" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T14:05:25+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  2:05PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vulpinoid</cite>your character is seriously underpowered to go adventuring until they've gained a bit of experience...and the only way to gain experience is to go adventuring and kill stuff...catch-22, no???</blockquote>\nIt's not a catch-22.  It's an encouragement to newbies for them to play NPCs and monsters rather than actually having the fun that they signed up for.  (At least in some games, playing a monster gains you XP.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>But I don't see any reason that story-games techniques and player authority conflict with LARPing, boffer or not.  I've used bits from a variety of indie games in LARPs to good effect (Keys, Fanmail and DitV Escalation so far).  Any player authored things need communicated to those affected by it, which may mean confining the effect to those present or it might require recording and transmitting data somehow.

Once again I can bring it back to my MUSHing days and recall that the times that staff had to be called in to adjudicate were few and far between. I can't even imagine the kinds of ridiculous wizardry that went around behind closed doors between consenting adults, dice rolls be damned.<br/><br/>But what happens in MU*s of some size are micro-pockets of reality, where established cliques have developed mutually-agreed-upon conventions for what is real in their universe. There is a baseline - the party line provided by the organizers, the "state documents" if you will - but then there are deviations, ranging from shared memories of play like "Patricia is the current Steward as elected by the Council" to abominations like "according to his (unvetted) backstory Pete is the orphan son of Zeus".<br/><br/>I'm not saying that's bad in any way - to some degree this setup is integral to the success of a large MU* -  but it's not similar to any LARP I've ever participated in. Nobody would accepts outlandish statements because it's in somebody's backstory. The casting of a world-altering magical spell may be questioned weeks after, as its occurrence is recounted OOC to a player whose character can sense magic. Someone doesn't get to take advantage of Draconian Armour +5 from taping fish scales on his hauberk, even if his friend claims it's true he killed and skinned a dragon spawn.<br/><br/>Connected to this is the fact that having things accepted in objective, sanctioned fictional reality in a MU* is infinitely harder than performing extreme and far-reaching supernatural acts in the privacy of your own home. The more your game is based around play in reality cliques, the harder it is to break out of that model and have narrative accepted on a global level. That's when you realize that summoning a demon among friends is actually much easier than being elected to public office, or even starting a campaign to be elected to public office. I'd imagine the same would apply to LARPs adopting such a model.<br/><br/>Disregarding all the above, narrative authority isn't even necessarily based on your character's abilities. I'll have to read the oMET rules to see what you mean, I suppose, but it seems to me that particularly your Mage examples are oriented around Actor-stance ability use and what they can accomplish, rather than Author- or Director-stance narrative authority useful as techniques for Story Now play. Many MU*s has no rules against authoring or directing the actions of invented NPCs, atmospheric disturbances, traffic accidents, etc - what would happen if I shouted "watch out for that truck!" and dove for cover in a Mage LARP? Would anyone care, unless it came from a GM?<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm far out on this one and misunderstanding the culture and play style entirely, my comprehension being based mostly on analogies and a handful of experiences back in the 90s.<br/><br/>EDIT TO ADD: Nick, that's interesting.

It's just a question of (a) do the mechanics permit the change and (b) can it be communicated to all affected participants? Your talk of MU*s refers to a "mechanics" that's very wide open--freeform with some form of vote or veto, right? See, I'm thinking of a game system now in whcih there IS NO veto or vote--if you have the juice, the facts of the world change. Universalis LARP, basically: if no one challenges and you have the coins for what you instantiate or assert, it enters the game reality, period. No vote, no "dealing with cliques." Just systemic controls with checks and balances.<br/><br/>Now, if the system checks with a vote process, then one might run up against "voting blocs" that will try to protect pet projects. But that can happen even at a table, just at a smaller scale (and with more likelihood of hung votes!). And that can even happen with simulationist, pure "actor stance" rules: if my faction of PCs says no one enters the tavern without paying a door fee (to us) then it's a Fact... so long as we can enforce it with will and steel. We can assert the "Fact" that Mikael's character is a liar and a scoundrel with whom no one should do business... especially if we control a key resource or provide a critical service and are willing to withhold that from folks who deny our "Truths."<br/><br/>No, that's not QUITE what you mean by narrative authority. But it's authority. You just seem to think that the only authority in LARPs are the GMs, and I'm saying that's totally not been my experience. After all, even organizers have to keep players happy, or the population shrinks, venues become too expensive, and a death spiral ensues (or, more often, a schism over some dumb-ass rule tweak that breaks a troupe in half!). And even simulation systems provide handles on the game world's facts, just not handles which can lever the entire paradigm (except Mage, in my experience).<br/>-----<br/>I'm kinda wondering what Michael was looking for in a "story game boffer LARP," now. One can lift techniques from story games almost at will--again, the only limitations for LARP that aren't for TT are communication round-trip times and access to GMs for communications of state changes. Any other limitation is (I conjecture) baked into the system or is "enforced" by a social contract or social paradigm for "how this game/world works." In other words: Tradition enabled by either by a system's agnostic approach to narrative control or by a system' excessive, inherent checks on control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242638/#Comment_242638" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T16:53:02+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  4:53PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My anecdote: this one time I ran a Firefly LARP at a convention, and it seemed successful.<br/><br/>- Tried some light SG-ish conflict mechanics to encourage genre-wise escalation and a little bit of theme. Marginal results here, though at least the rules handled most PvP issues and got out of the way when necessary.<br/><br/>- I seeded the game with various McGuffin items, some "find the PC who can X" personal objectives, and a very few plot events, as is relatively standard for LARPs. This was good to do.<br/><br/>- I seeded most characters with kick-ish motives in the above, giving them something they really needed to get done Right Now, in the duration of the trip. Some of this wasn't so much a quest as doing some freeform RP to find a goal.

If you need more than that, system-wise, can't it be:<br/><br/><i>Easily-maneuvered weapons do 3 damage.<br/>Regular weapons do 4 damage.<br/>Unwieldy weapons do 5 damage.<br/><br/>Every time you score a hit against someone, call out the amount of damage you just did.<br/><br/>People have a Hit Point Total (perhaps 25, or perhaps its character dependent).

Magic. 2. Portraying attack effectiveness. 3. Expenditure of resources. Probably other things that I would think of if I pulled the NERO rulebook out and studied it again. (I played in the Pittsburgh-area PRO chapter until I moved west, six years ago. Things may have changed.)<br/><br/>Set that aside, though. Similar to D&amp;D4, combat is the part of NERO (and other boffer systems, I'd wager) that mostly works. What doesn't work is pretty much everything else. <br/><br/>Subsystems of the rules, like the rogue abilities, are so awful that no one uses them. I don't think I saw a lock picked or a trap disarmed in my entire time in the woods. The approved method for dealing with traps was to figure out who was most tanklike, send him in first, and have a healer backpack him with a Purify Blood and a CxW ready. As a healer, I "disarmed" my fair share.<br/><br/>Mechanical character differentiation is nearly zero. From the organizers' perspective, my character was interchangeable in almost every way with any other healer of a similar level. I had no way to raise flags other than getting tangled up in politics, which didn't appeal to me or my character; even once my guy reached moderately high level, the only way I had to get him involved in adventures was to be a hyper-diligent eavesdropper, willing to get in over my/his head. There is no mechanical support for that, of course.<br/><br/>There is close to zero support in the mechanics for player authorship. Crafting skills, basically. Other than that, you need to appeal to the GMs with your plot ideas. That didn't actually bother me while I was playing, but it does now.<br/><br/>One thing: someone mentioned that you could play monsters, but it wasn't what you came to do. Actually, I gave up playing my character for a while and would only show up to play for the GMs' team, and it was at least as much fun as developing my single character. PRO, our chapter, did grant you XP and treasure for playing monsters, and let you play for free or close to it; it also encouraged us to keep their ratio of NPC events to PC events at 1:2 or higher by offering a substantial discount to players who did so. But heck with that. Monsters are fun! Kids wait all year to play monsters on Halloween. I loved putting on the green tabard and getting my goblin on. There was a whole clique of PRO members who rarely did anything else, in fact. So there's one reward cycle that worked, even if it was at the metagame level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242703/#Comment_242703" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T09:06:28+00:00" title="November 19, 2009  9:06AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Can someone tell me why boffer LARPs need complicated combat systems?</blockquote>Hehe... as a core system, what you spelled out is more complicated than GLASS.<br/><br/>The issue of complexity is a matter of taste (and NOT a matter of "being benighted" and other passive-aggressive pejoratives). PLENTY of LARP games (mostly "fest LARPs") have rules which read, basically: "Fight well, act out your character, drop when you think that you've taken enough damage to be disabled." other LARP games have even fewer rules than that ("Do what thou wilt, until someone calls bullshit").<br/><br/>BUT, some folks want a system to model a variety of effects which are impossible to actually DO (I can't fling fire from my fingertips, can you?) or is too dangerous to DO (I'd rather not have folks actually trying to trip me in mass combat, thanks!). So that stuff gets modeled, be it by special attack types (Root, Trip, Disarm) or by safe props (birdseed-filled packets to hit with a ranged effect that is not a projectile form a kid-safe weapon) or by special procedures (point at and name--if you can--the target of a Stare attack, while announcing the result and adding "by Staring" to the end of the Call). [Note that, yes, this means some LARPs allow magic that is not just thrown packets.] Even more STAT-based LARP system try to enable folks to play characters that they physically can't handle playing (GLASS eschews this in favor of heavier DO play). That's what bring in the (contemptible, confusing, cacophonous) damage calls you see in crappy YouTube videos--someone who can't really handle a boffer wants to be a Big Warrior, so the system allows him or her to buy up permanent damage, communicated with a value Call. Since it's also obvious (and of more verisimilitude) to allow folks to tool up defense with armor and protection abilities, you get an arms race which--but I begin to rant.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that many of the more-complex LARP rules exist to provide a cost-balanced means to enable too risky or too expensive modes of play, for both players and GMs (an example of the latter is something like Threshold tests versus Attributes--it saves the GMs from having to build an actual, say, obstacle course or computer-login-cracking puzzle or actual pickable locks or what-not). And, yes, a small proportion of them are just mimicking tabletop rules without much thought to handling issues--that's why I don't play NERO or TALAN or SOLAR in my area: they all have such genre-bound, finicky, or superfluous rules that I weary of ever learning to play effectively. I've actually designed GLASS since, oh, 2004 or so to UNDO most of that complexity in the course of play, by front-loading it into game type setup and character creation. PLUS, by using HERO as a model for a generic system design, I can offer MORE flexibility and room for creativity than any NERO clone, with LESS actual rules procedures and Calls to learn and memorize.

I was going to, as it's the only boffer LARP system I really know, and I think there are a lot of things to recommend it.  The big thing is that you don't call damage with every swing, only when you expend an ability.  Makes fights much, much less cacophonous, and less annoying.  I won't play any game with a NERO-like system.  It's just dumb to have to say something EVERY TIME YOU SWING YOUR SWORD.<br/><br/>In general, in the nTeraction games I've been involved with, there is a certain amount of respect for the rules and the system.  Some, mind you, not always as much as I'd like.  But certainly the mindset of the GMs is to use the rules to create the kinds of encounters they want to see, rather than ignoring the rules.<br/><br/>There is something else I want to say as a preface to my main proposal, that will probably piss a lot of people off but I think is important.  I see a lot of clutter in this thread about, for example, WoD LARPs.  In my opinion and my (considerable) experience, boffer LARPs and theater-style LARPs (or slow-time LARPs, or whatever you want to call them) are different media, and they are in particular just about as different from each other as each of them is from tabletops.  The terminologies, mechanical considerations, etc. of theater-LARPs don't translate to boffer LARPs any better than do the ideas of tabletop games.  So I'm going to focus on the things specific to *boffer* LARPs\u2014SG-ifying theater-LARPs is way, way easier and way more progress has been made in that venue anyway.<br/><br/>I agree with the "combat works, other stuff doesn't" complaint about boffer LARPs, by the way, since I like the nTeraction combat system but am sometimes bored at sessions by not enough to do/attention from GMs/etc.  The ritual magic system in <a href="http://www.aralis.net/" rel="nofollow">the game I play</a> adds a lot of flexibility, an incredibly open-ended but risky way of accomplishing things outside the throwing of packets.<br/><br/>I'm pretty intrigued by the idea of reframing the way situation\u2014aka "plot"\u2014is generated, while leaving the combat mechanics basically alone.  A major tenet of nTeraction is that you aren't allowed to break character all weekend.  Can be awesome for immersion but frustrating for communication about important things, as you can imagine.<br/><br/>But there is a culture of both elaborate backstory-writing and also writing long between-session letters to the GMs.  So, I've been imagining a game where all of the plot\u2014*all* of it\u2014comes from player's backstories.  It doesn't solve the problem of equal attention, of course, but it's a start.  I think making sure that each smallish group of players has its own GM would help, rather than the current model of having GMs in charge of individual plotlines.<br/><br/>I also like the idea of a Goals system for CP gain, rather than the current model, which basically amounts to giving CP for showing up (and other contributions, like cleaning up the campsite, NPCing, etc).  If PCs were dependent on progress towards Goals for CP gain, that would necessarily force a restructuring of the way "plot" was handled.<br/><br/>So, yes, boffer LARPs do need the SG treatment, but in my opinion this can be accomplished through the redesign of the non-numerical aspects of the system.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242823/#Comment_242823" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-19T23:10:20+00:00" title="November 19, 2009 11:10PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>I see a lot of clutter in this thread about, for example, WoD LARPs.

Players gain instant ideas to take their character as soon as they affiliate with a group. "Do I follow the status quo and develop a hatred for that group just because my faction traditionally doesn't like them?", "Do I take a more interesting role and try to reconcile the differences between the groups?", "Am I actually a traitor infiltrating for the enemy?"...then you throw in status plays to give a deeper political mechanism to the actions behind the conflict. <br/><br/>I haven't read anything like this in a boffer style game.<br/><br/>Sure the aim of playing a boffer game is to hit other people with your padded sticks, but I'd like to have an in character motivation for doing so...more than just getting some XP. I'm certainly going to push for keys in the system or something similar, gaining XP in a specific field for performing actions within that field.<br/><br/>I think I'll also be pushing for something more steampunk, with secret societies, mysterious inventions and dangerous, unconventional technologies that don't always work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242930/#Comment_242930" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T12:54:27+00:00" title="November 20, 2009 12:54PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2009 12:58PM by phargle.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

Some boffers are very sport-oriented, and the roleplay and characterization is an afterthought, while the rules themselves are fundamentally little changed from the 1980s.  Others are more roleplay-oriented, but still have some of the same rule problems (and I'm less familiar with those ones.)  The problem with boffers is that the resolution mechanic looms very large, and no amount of story will surmount it - and, if it does, it becomes unsatisfying to the person who would have otherwise won.  Imagine playing a PvP RPG with someone who is very good at rolling dice, or even a VLarp with someone who has mastered the psychology of rock-paper-scissors, and who has fun doing those things regardless of story, and you might get a glimpse of what I mean. There's a strong dichotomy between roleplayers and non-roleplayers that arises from that.  As a result, our successful games are informed by online FPS sensibilities.  <br/><br/>Hope this helps,<br/>Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242950/#Comment_242950" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T14:35:56+00:00" title="November 20, 2009  2:35PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: phargle</cite>Some boffers are very sport-oriented, and the roleplay and characterization is an afterthought, while the rules themselves are fundamentally little changed from the 1980s.</blockquote>\nIt's good to see my theory backed up by someone "on the inside".\n<blockquote>...As a result, our successful games are informed by online FPS sensibilities.</blockquote>\nInteresting (especially if you're meaning what I think you're meaning)....by FPS do you mean (F)irst (P)erson (S)hooter?

Each side would see their own characters as heroes in an epic struggle against everyone else out there (whether those characters look like a troop of humans, a squad of elves, a mob of orcs, a pack of owlbears, or anything else for that matter...).<br/><br/>The person who prompted this thread said that he wanted to "update" the game by incorporating some 4e mechanisms, I'm guessing that he means characters gain effects that can be used once per conflict/per story/etc., as well as gaining benefits for specific roles within a party, such as striker/defender/etc.<br/><br/>If players are divided up into teams, in this manner, then those sorts of things become more viable, and they turn into ways that teamwork can actually benefit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242957/#Comment_242957" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-20T15:08:43+00:00" title="November 20, 2009  3:08PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny how things work out.  In Amtgard, most games typically consist of two teams, with anywhere from one to hundreds of combatants per side.  Each person plays a class, and has a number of lives they can lose before they have to sit out the remainder of the battle.  Each class serves a certain role on the battlefield, and has at-will, per-life, and per-game abilities. Some powers are used to blast bad guys.  Some are used for command-and-control of the battlefield.  Some are used to hold your ground.  Some are used to buff allies.

The occasional line modules and scheduled field battles might be done as "set pieces" to conclude some external threat's influence on the game space; but the day-in-and-day-out stories and long term conflicts all centered around individuals, factions, and "politics."<br/><br/>In the end, I think this is yet-another "Design What Matters" versus "Design What Doesn't Matter" debate; and it's being hampered by term drift also.<br/><br/>For many boffer LARPs (or LARPs in general) the system is designed to handle, quickly, the types of conflicts that will ensue between the principle types of characters in the world. Due to the real time nature of such LARPs, the system is perforce granular and task-based. Story, theme, plot--all that is emergent from play, with SOME ability for the GMs to shape it with the NPC characters they interject into play. Thus, for many, that's Design What Doesn't Matter--they want to play stories out, be in grand battles, shape a game world; and so any system that regulates that, forces it into a particular mode (e.g. Hero Points for plot additions, resource games mandatory), is undesirable.<br/>Conversely, Design What Matters folks, in LARP, end up with things like Jeep and highly structured systems that drive EXACTLY toward the game theme or the emotional space being explored or whatever. Those folks find rules for how much damage one can do per swing or what abilities one can do per day utterly orthogonal and "silly": because such mechanics don't provide them with levers to actually shape story, they presume there is no way to get story out of them.<br/><br/>No one's right; there is no right way. There are preferences born of experience, and there are opinions formed from limited exposure. For myself, I find that a light-but-flexible system is a perfect balance--not as much crunch and niggling details ("genre bindings," I call them) as a system which seem like miniatures game done full scale; but not "meta-level" controls over story with things like Hero Points, narrative token economies, or similar. Combat is fast and generally quiet (no Calls for every swing); and I can focus on the situation and acting rather than on mental math or recalling esoteric incantations or rules for special situations.<br/><br/>Some folks like the crunch, and go to boffer LARPs to be "FPS players." Good on 'em. Some folks like the acting and politicking, and go to boffer LARPs without even a weapon on hand. Good on 'em. Neither is mutually exclusive. Neither is dictated by the way rules are written... though either can be influenced--even favored--by what the rules enable and forbid.<br/><br/>I think any further discussion of "storyify boffer LARPs" needs to define what storify means in that particular context. (Again, I think I got pretty darned close with Commit and Player Priority rules--only you can perform the worst deprotagonization of yourself: dieing!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243515/#Comment_243515" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T15:11:29+00:00" title="November 24, 2009  3:11PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, my main background is in the LARP scene in the UK.
