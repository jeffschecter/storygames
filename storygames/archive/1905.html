                    Hi!<br/>
  Someone (and many others obviously) mentioned recently that rolling for investigation in order to keep playing CoC seemed wrong (paraphrase, not exact quote).<br/>
  I don't play CoC, but the question has been raised time and again, "why do I have to roll to get some6thing my character needs in order for the scenario to continue and what do I do if I fail?"<br/>
  This is a great question. But I've never seen the answer...<br/>
<br/>
  The scenario is, the players have a mystery to solve, and the GM has a clue to give them, possible ways to handle this?:<br/>
1) Use the game's mechanics to see if the character can identify the clue from the setting<br/>
2) Give the player the clue they need for the game to continue<br/>
<br/>
  Option 1 seems fraught with peril. I mean, what happens if the character does not discover the clue?<br/>
  Option 2 seems boring and borderline railroading.<br/>
  I imagine there are other options, but what are they?<br/>

                            Well, <i>InSpectres</i> lets the players narrate what they find and eventually piece together the supernatural mystery on their own once a certain threshold of franchise dice is achieved. It's frigging brilliant, too. Failures are usually narrated by the GM, but are very much of the creating compliations variety, rather than throwing up a dead end to the game.<br/><br/>Several other games (Troy Costisick's <i>Holmes and Watson Committee</i>, my own Reversed Engineer entry <i>Utopolis: Policing the Retrofuture</i>, and Christoph Boeckle's <i>The Ia! Ia! Ph'iles</i>) are exploring similar territory of allowing the mystery to be solved on the fly, rather than having a pre-set solution that the players must follow the breadcrumbs to discover. Using such a model, a failure doesn't derail the whole game because it wasn't going in one specific direction anyway. <br/><br/>In <i>Utopolis</i>, I'm thinking of having failures result in the GM providing a Lead to the player that can provide direction to the next scene, but that cannot be later used as Evidence to make an arrest of the perpretator. Successes produce Clues that also lead to the next scene, but also can be used as Evidence later by spending in-game currency. Of coure, all Clues are narrated by the players on the fly.                        </div>

                            Here's one:  Focus on the clue's thematic value rather than acquisition.  "OK, you discover that Baron Humphries is the killer. Since he's your brother, and holds the code sequence to activate the lunar resonator in his head, that puts you in an interesting spot, no?"<br/><br/>I'd also disagree that giving stuff up is bad form; I do it lots.

                            Hi!<br/>
  Eric, that's cool, and I dig those kinds of games. But those don't really address the question I am asking.<br/>
  What happens when one player (the GM) holds the keys to the mystery (not all roleplaying, just mysteries, one player knowing the answer to the mystery can be more fun anyways). How does the story progress?<br/>
  I like the failure generates new leads idea though.<br/>
  Anyone else?<br/>

                            Dave,<br/><br/>You can always make the mechanics not be about whether they find the clue but whether they find the clue with/without resulting complications.<br/><br/>Did they find the clue in time to stop the next murder?<br/>Did they tip the villain off that they were on to him when they found the clue?<br/>Did someone get hurt finding the clue?<br/>Did suspicion get put on one of the PC's when they found the clue?<br/><br/>If you make the roll about something like the stuff above then you never have to worry about whether a necessary clue gets discovered.  The issue isn't whether the PC's are going to be able to put the puzzle together but rather how much is it going to personally cost them in order to do so.                        </div>

  Jason, I see what you mean. Give them the clue, but in a way that adds to the fun.<br/>
  Andrew, that's great! How can you make that a mechanic?<br/>

                            Yeah, I'm with Gaerik that the "complications" approach is best. In other words, what's at stake when you roll is NOT whether or not the player characters (or some character) gets the clue: It's absolute, no question, 100%, they will get it. What's at stake is the PRICE they pay for it. Succeed in the roll, you can translate the document on your own without any trouble, you figure out who the cultist is before he kills again, you learn where the ritual object is in time to protect it. Fail in the roll, you can understand enough of the document to get to the next step but you keep hearing horrible voices in your head, you only figure out who the cultist is after he's killed three more people, you rush to the museum to protect the ritual object only to find the case empty, the glass broke, and a guard lying on the floor with no face or testicles.<br/><br/>Or, on a higher level, as Jason says, you could make the clue a gimme, but what to DO with what you've learned the hard part. In most investigation games, getting the clues is hard, but once you've got them, the what-to-do is obvious: Kill the bad guy, stop the ritual, save the girl, whatever. In hardcore Story Now games, figuring out who's doing what is just the beginning: Maybe the bad guy is someone you can't just kill, because he's too prominent, or because he's your brother, or because he genuinely thinks he's doing the right thing; maybe the ritual can be turned to good ends instead of evil, if you can just talk to the cultists, because they're genuinely convinced they're going to save the world instead of end it; maybe saving the girl means putting the whole city at risk.                        </div>

                            Dave,<br/><br/>I'm going to point to Sydney's explaination of what I was trying to say.  There's no need for additional mechanics to do this.  You can do it with D&amp;D or TSoY or Burning Wheel or... hell, any game I can think of.  Just take the standard resolution system and alter what's actually getting resolved.  What's getting resolved is never whether or not the clue is going to be found but what consequences go along with finding the clue.  Here's an example scenario using bog standard D&amp;D rules.<br/><br/>Player:  Now that I've broken into Lord Evil's room I'm going to search it for a CLUE(tm).<br/>DM:  Okay, roll your Search skill against a DC 20.<br/><br/>CASE 1<br/>Player:  Yay!  I got a 23!<br/>DM:  You found the CLUE(tm).  It indicates that Lord Evil is going to be starting the next phase of his Evil Plot(tm) at his tower outside of town.  You just have enough time to get there before he starts... if you hurry.<br/><br/>CASE 2<br/>Player:  Damn!  I got a 15!<br/>DM:  You found the CLUE(tm).  As you finish reading it, you realize that you will have to hurry to thwart Lord Evil's Evil Plot(tm).  Unfortunately two of Lord Evil's goons rush into the room.  Fight!<br/><br/>See?  I'm still using D&amp;D's basic resolution mechanic and there are still consequences for failure.  The consequences for failure just don't include stalling the whole game by not handing out necessary information.  With this method suspence and skill are still a factor but not to just keep the story going.  It also means your players aren't going to be upset about failing.  After all, failing means we get more cool stuff to do.                        </div>

                            In addition to Graham's good reference, I give you what may be the definitive work on this particular subject, one of Bryan Bankhead's three rants on the problems of Call of Cthulhu, this one called "Cuthulhu's Clues.": <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?t=8482" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?t=8482</a><br/>
<br/>
The problem boils down to essential incoherence in terms of what people play CoC for. Are you trying to "win" the scenario? Or are you trying to get a good Lovecraftian tale out of the play? I mean, actually it works semi-functionally to say that if you miss the roll, the scenario is over. Players lose. Just like getting killed in a D&amp;D combat. No different.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem there is that the rules make it so that failure is extremely likely this way. The GM senses this, and usually ends up trying to find some illusionist method to make it look like the failure wasn't plot ending. I've often used a simple Magician's Force for this myself:<br/>
<br/>
"You rolled a success? Cool, you find an article that says that Roberts died here a year ago! Doesn't say what the cause of death was, though."<br/>
OR<br/>
"You rolled a failure? Too bad. All you can find is an article that says that Roberts died here a year ago. But, unfortunately it doesn't say what the cause of death was."<br/>
<br/>
(Andrew's example comes close to this. I'd recommend in that case saying, "It takes you too long to find the clue" so that the player understands how his character's failure is leading to the new problem. The very metagame version can actually look like railroading even when it's not.)<br/>
<br/>
Truth be told, a player really can't be all that thrilled at a successful mechanical outcome - yeah he created the character, and can be proud that it's performing, but it takes no talent to roll the dice. Even in D&amp;D combat, there are choices like whether or not to use expendable resources. With a library use die roll there is none. The player talent being showed off is, if anything, remembering to make the obligatory trip to the library to look stuff up.<br/>
<br/>
The advice above from all of the posters makes sense, because what they're doing is finding ways to make the outcome of the contest meaningful again, without the scenario ending. Here's a fact, Dave: you say you don't want to railroad, but you've also decided that things can't progress without this bit of information. Well, you've got two options, then, give the data, or end the scenario.<br/>
<br/>
Here's another perspective. Is it railroading to say that it's raining on the characters? I mean, you've established a fact, and the players have been given no other option. Is that railroading? No. It's the GM's job to make up information about the game world. That's unavoidable. If you make up a fact that Y character knows X thing, that's just doing the GM's job.<br/>
<br/>
What's dysfunctional is not allowing the player a chance to have input into the game at all, presenting choices only to make them for him. So, yeah, if you present this fact, and the only choice is to "find the fact" or have the scenario stall, that's no choice at all for the player. That's railroading. What you have to do is to make the facts you present provide decisions for the player to make, give a place where player input can occur. So, if my rainstorm is there to force you to go inside so my plot can continue, that's railroading. If my raincloud exits so that you can choose to stay outside to prove how tough your character is, or go inside to show how prudent, that's good play.<br/>
<br/>
As everyone above is saying, the key to informational contests is to not make them about whether you get the information, but what new decision you have once you have the information. Note this well: it's just as railroady to give the player information and have only one possible choice for the player. How many times have we seen:<br/>
<br/>
GM: "The cause of death was drowning in oil."<br/>
Player: "Well, I guess we should go look around the old abandoned oil field we found earlier."<br/>
<br/>
Instead, make sure that the info gives them a choice. For example for competitive play:<br/>
<br/>
GM: "The cause of death was drowning in oil."<br/>
Player: "Well, that could indicate either the oil field, or that pool of oil we found in the basement of the old house. Which should we go to first? Or should we split up?"<br/>
<br/>
Even this isn't great gamism design, unless it's made clear that there's some time element that makes it important to solve the mystery in short order. Generally I'm with the posters above in that the CoC material suits more thematic play than player challenge play. In that case:<br/>
<br/>
GM: "The cause of death was drowning in oil."<br/>
Player: "Oil? That means that Laura is involved in this? What do I do, turn her in? Or go face her about it? Or do I just keep the secret?"<br/>
<br/>
It's a simple principle - information, or failure to get information, all have to lead to some sort of player choice. Any other option is less fun, becuase, simply, the player has less to do.<br/>

                            Hi!<br>
  Thanks guys! I had been doing some of this all along, but didn't have the words to explain it very well. I will paraphrase this for the GM advice section of my book!<br>
<br>
  If anyone has anything to ass, please feel free to do so.<br>
