Perhaps you'll notice that when you try to explain it.<br/>- Explaining it helps <i>you</i>, no matter what effect it might have on your audience.  Everyone knows one of the best ways to learn something and study it in depth is to teach it to someone else: it's likely that when you sit down to explain your theme, you'll understand how it relates to your game even better, and can feed that right back into your creative process.<br/>- Explicitly stating it makes it easy to provide references and other sources for people to consider: if the theme is that important to the game, why not give your audience some additional resources to explore it further?<br/>- You might be wrong about how cool the theme is.  Explicitly stating it gives the reader an open invitation to notice this and call you on it.<br/>- Explicitly stating the theme makes it easier to deconstruct your game and do other things with it.  You might not care about this, you might even HATE this, but it's still a good thing for everyone, I think.  It will let your game reach new people (who will rip it apart and use it for their own purposes, yes, but that's show biz, and anyway, a sale is a sale).<br/><br/>Reasons why you might not want to:<br/>- The theme might be unappealing, and stating it explicitly could drive people away.  "Oh, I hate those games about man subjugating the environment."  "Oh boy, another one-note symphony about mankind's alienation from himself."<br/>- Explaining your theme well can be really hard to do.<br/>- It can, as you mention, lock some people into prefabricated patterns.  Could be good, could be bad; depends on what you like, I guess.<br/><br/><br/>If it were up to me, I'd say explain it.  Don't skimp on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, you should absolutely still try to skillfully design your system and setting to address the theme or produce the kind of play you want, but I really see more benefits from being up front and clear about your goals than I see drawbacks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199216/#Comment_199216" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-28T15:47:22+00:00" title="March 28, 2009  3:47PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2009 3:47PM by scottdunphy.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may sound like a cop-out, but doesn't it depend on the theme?

You're right that this makes the game easier to deconstruct, but I feel that perhaps deconstruction can be enjoyable in itself, and not just something that ought to be faciliated so as to be quickly gotten over with. To take something that appears to be chaotic, without any visible logic, and slowly pull the strands apart to reveal (what one takes to be) the inner working principle. A little bit like playing Nobilis. I feel that the "scene" you've got going around here very much subscribes to an aesthetic ideal of transparency and openness (maybe I'm wrong, or maybe this has changed recently \u2014 it's been a while since I bought or read an American "indie" game), but this is, after all, just an aesthetic trend and not any kind of eternal norm of good design.<br/><br/>As regards your comment on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, I'm not entirely sure about that either. If, as you suggest, it might be a good idea to allow for "deconstructing" a game, then perhaps one should also be careful about putting too many obstacles in the way for a successful deconstruction.

If you have a theme explicitly in mind, I think you'll get more oomph out of explicitly mentioning it somewhere in the text; both for your own sake, and for the sake of whoever's going to be playing it.  Why make it a riddle when it doesn't have to be?  I say, just put it out there and let people make their own riddles out of it if they want to: if there's some deep philosophical underpinning you built it on, don't spend 4 pages hinting at it when you could SAY IT CLEARLY in one and use the other 3 pages to add depth and references and useful suggestions and alternate themes and all that other stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199262/#Comment_199262" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T03:25:40+00:00" title="March 29, 2009  3:25AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>No, it is always better to say what the game is about, because then if I don't want to play that game, I know, and can then start evaluating whether I want to change what it's about, or toss it aside.<br/><br/>Space limitations are your enemy in explicating your game, not some coyness or tact.</blockquote>\nI think at this point it might be important to note that theme is not necessarily the same thing as genre or style, but it is very, very similar.<br/>Another plus-point for not defining your theme explicitly is that it makes the game more approachable for players who have an idea for an adventure they'd like to run, and are looking for a suitable system. On the opposite side of course if they want the theme you're pushing then that might steer them more firmly towards your game.<br/><br/>For the record, I don't think either approach is right or wrong so long as the theme isn't only described, then not supported. It won't matter if you tell everyone your game is about trust and betrayal (for example) if the rules and/or the setting don't evoke that theme. Don't rely on telling people what your game is about to make your game be about that, you have to demonstrate or even enforce it. I guess that's another reason why telling people the theme is bad - it may put unreasonable expectations in their heads that aren't met later on.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199282/#Comment_199282" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-29T08:51:13+00:00" title="March 29, 2009  8:51AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Discovering a game's "emergent behaviors" used to be the new hotness for me.

Either people are using the word in a way that it's not usually used, or they are talking about games doing something they don't usually do.<br/><br/>A game doesn't normally have a "theme", it has a<i> thematic premise</i>. A thematic premise is the<i> generalized </i>dramatic question that a game system asks, like "what's worth dying for?" or "who deserves mercy?". A "theme" is the<i> specific </i>answer that emerges from play, like "love is worth dying for" or "only the innocent deserve mercy". (This is basically how it works in movies and books as well.) Furthermore, it's worth noting that a game's thematic premise is often over-simplified for advertising's sake, and the true premise is much more broad. For example, Dogs is often described as being "about" judgment, while actually there's a whole lot in it about responsibility, coming of age, spirituality, getting along with others, etc. Similarly, emergent theme relies heavily on dynamic content, meaning the stuff that gets invented in play. So taking Dogs as the example again, the emergent theme might actually be something like "proving your worth to a loved one", even though there's nothing inherent to the rules to promote such a theme.<br/><br/>So when y'all talk about a "game's theme", are you referring to the thematic premise, or do you mean a game that actually presents its own, pre-defined dramatic "answer"? There's more I can say, but I'm going to wait for some clarification.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199431/#Comment_199431" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T07:28:13+00:00" title="March 30, 2009  7:28AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, include your theme, but ask it as a question, rather than a proscribed belief.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199435/#Comment_199435" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T07:47:20+00:00" title="March 30, 2009  7:47AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But Tim, you're talking about Theme, which is a term, while I think Calvino is talking about theme, which is a word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199442/#Comment_199442" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T08:08:21+00:00" title="March 30, 2009  8:08AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2009 9:42AM by timfire.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite>But Tim, you're talking about Theme, which is a term, while I think Calvino is talking about theme, which is a word.</blockquote>\nHuh?

I made a point to clarify terminology usage because there are two ways "theme" can be interpreted here: a) as the dramatic "question", or b) as the dramatic "answer"... or actually, I guess there's also c) something else, maybe an idea that undergirds the "reality" of the game system outside of the dramatic premise/theme.<br/><br/>Those 2 (or 3) possibilities are very different. The way someone answers Calvino's basic question is going to depend on how they understand what he's talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199459/#Comment_199459" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T09:12:10+00:00" title="March 30, 2009  9:12AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><br/>I disagree.

I don't see 8th Century Kazakhstan as a more or less appropriate setting for the game than the one Pondsmith pulled out of his arse after reading the blurb on the back of <i>Neuromancer</i> and watching MTV for about sixteen hours straight.  There's so much room for interpretation in any and every game that I've learned that "we're playing X" is really no indication at all of what the game is like.  Having expectations based upon system is an expression of type-based thinking and lazy forms of thought.  It's like building up an expectation of what a person is like based upon the colour of their skin or the colour of their hair.

What about Trollbabe? Or Bliss Stage? Or Toon? Still no expectation? Because if that's true, well, we're in such separate corners of the universe that I don't know what to say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199477/#Comment_199477" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T10:13:11+00:00" title="March 30, 2009 10:13AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>do you seriously mean that you have no expectation at all of what the game's going to be like?</blockquote>\nI think he's saying he has expectations, which will inevitably and always be proven completely wrong.

Which is why I was going on about you being all term-y. I suspect that what Calvino is talking about is something more like we use the word in actual daily speech. But then I don't even know what I mean by that, and if I know Calvino (and I do!), he enjoys terminology, so I'm sure he has some specific concept in mind.<br/><br/>So, eh, never mind.

At least that's been my experience.<br/></blockquote>\nIndeed.  I think that one can have *pre-conceptions* about a particular game but short of sitting down and playing that adventure with that GM and those players, there's little or no way to make an informed judgment about what a game is likely to be about.  Pre-conceptions about games are just examples of lazy thinking and prejudice.  there are so many levels of interpretation and creative autonomy in-between Pondsmith writing Cyberpunk and my sitting down to play a given session of Cyberpunk that "I'm playing Cyberpunk" is close to being meaningless.<br/><br/>Discussions of roleplaying have, over the years, migrated into this form of ultra auteur theory.  Auteur theory being a way of talking about a film in terms of the creative decisions of its director alone.  The problem with auteur theory is that everyone in the cinematic process has a degree of creative input.  From the actors and the DP down to the guys that do the lighting.  In most cases the directors don't even have last cut of the films they direct.  Auteur theory makes no philosophical sense as even before you get into questions of who is responsible for what effect and what their intentions might have been you have to deal with the text of the film that is hugely open to interpretation.  One of the best films I saw in 2008 was a thriller whose real meaning had clearly completely escaped the Director.  He'd wanted to make some sleazy reactionary piece aboutthe dangers of technology but watching the film it felt more like an attack on the border-line stalkerish behaviour everyone uses in the run up to asking someone out.  You might ask your friends about them, maybe google them, prick up your ears when you hear what their favourite band is... the fact that the film's bad guy used tactics that most people use completely failed to register with the director.  Therefore, the film he intended to make was a piece of shit, but the film that somehow got made is genuinely creepy and incredibly cool.<br/><br/>Most RPGs have even more levels of interpretation and creative input between the author and the end product than films do.  Doubly so if you have an RPG written by a load of different people.<br/><br/>The only reason for talking about authors in relation to RPGs is as a way of doing PR.  "Oh it's a such-and-such game! I'll buy that!" In truth who wrote the thing doesn't mean a thing.  Games are things that emerge almost by accident... they are not written.  Books are written and as any of those people with dozens of shelves full of supplements and core books but no gaming experience this decade can tell you, a book is not a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199554/#Comment_199554" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T15:34:24+00:00" title="March 30, 2009  3:34PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the games I like, I like the game to present what it's about in the form of a question.  The idea being that the game's design is a tool for getting the group to address that question through the created fiction.<br/><br/>Sorcerer - How far are you willing to go to get what you want?<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard - Where do the needs of the individual vs. the needs of the community begin and end?<br/>My Life with Master - Are some monsters worth loving?<br/><br/>Other games (that I like) don't provide an explicit question but instead have tools built into them that allow the group to arrive at a custom question for that specific play instance.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age... -&gt; the cross purpose best interests.<br/>Primetime Adventures -&gt; The character's Issues<br/>Dirty Secrets -&gt; The various crimes cross-sectioned with the demographics.<br/><br/>I don't think, however, that you need to spell the question out either in the game text or even as part of play.  I think people do a REALLY good job of extracting relevant life questions from evocative situations.  Trollbabe works on this 100%.  It just says: TROLLBABE!  And you either go, "Yes, let's play!" or "Huh?"<br/><br/>In fact, that's where my buy in to a game starts.  I look at it's basic setup and see if it raises within me questions I want to answer through that setup.  Then I look at the rules to see if they provide me with real tools to address those questions.  Sadly, the answers are often Yes and No.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200198/#Comment_200198" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T15:20:52+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  3:20PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>The author's intentions are completely irrelevant to the final game.
