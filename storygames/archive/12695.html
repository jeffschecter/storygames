Can you talk about how you choose what to offer, how you organize this, how you prepare, and how you facilitate and pace the session?<br/><br/>More people should do this.

That would both let you really explore the scene/characters and see how the mechanics from different games manipulated play.  <br/><br/>In fact, it would be neat to develop an anthology game wherein you play the same scene over and over again with different mechanics that reward different play-styles, perhaps something that hacks the theme of <i>Groundhog Day</i>.  It would be a good showcase game for illustrating the rules-matter philosophy.<br/><br/>Also, as a demo gimmick for a publisher or designer co-op, it would be fun to get a couple of designers to buy into this and have groups of 4-6 players go from table to table demoing different games with the same scene and characters (they'd get a folder with the same pregen character derived in each of the systems).  The last table would be stacks of each of the rulebooks and a cash register.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285191/#Comment_285191" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T10:28:30+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 10:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WHO DARES TO SUMMON ME?!<br/><br/>Oh, it's Jason. <br/><br/>I called it <b>Indie by Storm</b>, not the Indie Sm\xf6rg\xe5sbord, mostly because I couldn't figure out where to put the butter and the goose... er, I mean the umlaut and the ring. <br/><br/>Indie by Storm is 5-6 games in one four-hour slot. You get 30-40 minutes per game. Sometimes players are having so much fun that you don't want to stop, so you play a little longer. Sometimes they're having tons of fun and you make them stop anyway, making them ravenously hungry for more. This is the point at which you tell them where they can purchase the game in question.<br/><br/>This started as a two-hour thing at GenCon 2009. Some people had two hours but not four hours, and off the top of my head, I said, "Hey, how about I run you through three or four different indie demos?" The players loved this idea and off we went. I know the games that I prep for Games on Demand pretty well, so it wasn't hard to adapt these to a frenetic demo pace.<br/><br/>I put together a full Indie by Storm event at Dreamation. I ran two or three slots of this--regular slots in the program book. 3-6 players would show up. I'd hand them my Indie by Storm one-sheet that has for each game: the title, author, cover art, and a punchy high-concept description. I talk through these with the players quickly (5 minutes) and let them pick where to start, but shoo them away from certain games that can easily accommodate more players (Roach, carry), which I like to run last. That way, if we get stragglers or lookers-on, I can encourage them to jump in even if we're 3 hours into the slot.<br/><br/>My game list typically includes games for which I have great passion. If you don't have the passion, it will show for sure in a 30-minute demo. My library at Dreamation included: <br/>* My Life with Master<br/>* Annalise<br/>* Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>* carry: a game about war<br/>* The Shab-al-Hiri Roach<br/><br/>Going forward, I will probably add Fiasco, 3:16, Happy Birthday\\, Robot!, and Apocalypse World to my stack. Obviously, I will have more games than will fit in a single session, but them's the breaks. Players will have to take my word that the games they didn't get to play are at least a awesome as the ones they did.<br/><br/>Some games just are not suited to long demo play. I love Sorcerer, but don't think I could do it justice in 30-40 minutes. Annalise barely makes the cut here, because the character generation phase is super quick and I can showcase the best aspects of the game in the first half hour.<br/><br/>For each game, I take them through the full lifecycle of play (as much as possible). We create characters. Then I run them through a phase or two of play. Generally, everyone gets some spotlight time. Maybe we do only one character's initiation in Dogs, but jump immediately into a typical Town situation steeped with moral difficulty. <br/>In Annalise, we introduce our characters, make some claims, and get a few scenes into Laying the Foundations where those claims become important. When we play carry, I hand out characters (giving Sarge to the most outspoken player), we do dice collection, and I run through a squad scene and a combat scene (without warning them how the dice mechanics work till it's too late and they're killing grunts all over the place). My Life with Master gives us a chance to collaborate on an evil master and create minions, though I have to rush them through this part. We can get through two or three scenes per player in the remainder of the half hour. Roach has quick chargen, so we're off to the races and playing quickly. We can probably finish one event in the half hour--I let the players choose which of the six they want to try.<br/><br/>As we play, I'm not just GMing. I'm selling. I am explaining why these games are my favorites, why I think they're cool. I'm giving them a little game designer insight into why the game is different than other games, and why the mechanics are clever. It might be as simple as pointing out that Roach doesn't need a GM but has awesome cards that make the game dark and whacky. Or explaining how dice stand for things in Dogs: this is you shooting, this is your gun, this is your anger. Sometimes I just drop the coolness in their laps and watch their faces as they start to understand: this works best for carry's combat dice mechanics. I want the players to understand the essence of the game, through play and through explanation. I give them both.<br/><br/>I have to watch the clock a lot. A timer might help next time. I warn them at every 10-15 minutes: "We're 10 minutes in... We're 20 minutes in... only 5 minutes left." If we need to cut away from scenes, we will. Players understand that this is a demo. But I made sure, at the beginning, that they understand this. Set expectations.<br/><br/>By setting expectations up front, players know that this is gonna be a sprint. We're gonna haul ass through each game. There's no time for fucking around, because if they do, they will miss out on some other game at the tail end. Players are pretty good about this.<br/><br/>Generally, players walk away from the table exhausted but excited about new games. Maybe not every game resonates with every player, but usually each player can't stop talking about at least one game they played. Again, I remind them who wrote these games and where they can buy them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285192/#Comment_285192" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T10:30:49+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 10:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>It would be fun to come up with pregen characters and a hooky setting/scene and then play it out repeatedly with a variety of games [systems].</blockquote>\nI don't think the similar characters/situation is really necessary. It's a cool gimmick, but it would be tough to play in some cases. Some of these games just aren't that similar. Also, a lot of these games really don't support pregens--or need them. Making a character is half the fun of some games and I want that to be part of the experience. Playing a Dogs character you created is very different from playing one that someone else created.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285207/#Comment_285207" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T10:51:41+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 10:51AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, what's the critical mass in terms of players and games?

That game rocks in long demo form.<br/><br/>While Indie by Storm is a blast, I wouldn't totally eschew full-slot indie games! Those are fun, too, and can give you a deeper and more fulfilling experience with any single game.<br/><br/>My prep involves the following:<br/>* Make sure I have character sheets for these games, even if I have to make them myself. Character sheets help a ton.<br/>* For any game with any kind of complicated procedure, create a one- or two-sheet summary. This goes for chargen and play.<br/>* Make sure I have all the dice and other materials I need for that game.<br/>* If the game requires a scenario (Dogs needs a Town), I make sure I have a good one. <br/><br/>I tend to play these games by the book. I might skip sections of them but I like to at least touch on every aspect of play. If I skip a section, I let the players know what I'm skipping and why and the impact.<br/><br/>I like to have at least three players. However, I can demo some of these games with only one player other than myself, though play would suffer a little. I think I can effectively demo Dogs, Roach, MLwM, and Annalise to a single player. I would have trouble with Misspent Youth and carry, both of which are "squad" games. Roach and Annalise sneak into that list because they are GMless; otherwise, they wouldn't work with one GM and one player. <br/><br/>For most of these games, I want 3-5 players. Four is the sweet spot. Some games can handle a lot more. I've run fun games of Roach with ten participants. I firmly believe that carry can handle 10, as well. For this reason, I push these games to the end of my session and see if stragglers join late. (I once told J.R. Blackwell that she couldn't join a carry game after it started, and pretty much immediately kicked myself for it. Gah. Sorry, J.R. -- I owe you a session of a game of your choice.)<br/><br/>For a four hour session "Indie by Storm," have at least four games. An hour each is pretty reasonable and "roomy" or "comfortable." There is no reason you couldn't offer just two or three games in a four-hour session, but then it isn't "by Storm." <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> You are not likely to complete a game in less than 30 minutes, so eight is the theoretical maximum. People want bathroom breaks and you usually lose 5-10 minutes at the start and beginning, so seven half-hour games seems the real "max." More realistically, you'll spend 40-45 minutes on each game, and lose a half hour to the usual things, so expect to get through five games and maybe just four.<br/><br/>So it's clear, too, let me say that I do not pace these games like a typical game session. I drop people right into the thick of things, right into the crazy conflicts and action. Players have to hold onto their hats and run to keep up with me. (Really, more "typical" game sessions need to be this way, but that's another story.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20C" title="Tom C"><img alt="Tom C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tom%20C">Tom C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285326/#Comment_285326" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T18:26:33+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  6:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesus.
