Owlbear, of course. And page 3 has not just one actual honest-to-god Flail Snail, but two. There's a Roper on page 4, a Black Cloud of Vengeance  (one of my favorites from Al Qadim) on page 6, and the whole thing ends with a Gelatinous Cube. Not all of them are top-notch, of course, but it's amusing.<br/><br/>--Colin<br/><br/><small>WARNING: Do NOT attempt to go anywhere else on that site. Just take the name of the site at face value, OK? Photoshop Phriday is one of the few features they have that doesn't make my brain bleed.</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
