They say that you can play if you realy want to. It's true.<br/>One started friday evening and continued on saturday morning and afternoon. Three players + me GMing. Chinese political intrigue backstory with three veiled jade idols as a treasure and a vengefull rejected mage student possesses by 5 conflicting elemental spirits as a monster. Think "Saiunkoku monogatari" on testosterone. Pretty long game for our current standards (4 hours friday night + 5 on saturday).<br/><br/>The other was saturday night. Two players (one had left) + me GMing.<br/><br/>I won't enter into details this time but I'll make some observations about the system.<br/><br/>First I wanted to say that I used Eric's advices about adventure preparation (from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5561&amp;page=1#Item_2" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>) and that it went great. It's the right amount of prepared things that helps you go through the game without overplanning and trying to shoehorn your prep into the game.<br/><br/>For the second game, though, it was almost total impro, with just some things one of the player wanted and told me before the game : some pulpy Indiana Jones's like adventure with a big old creepy place at the end, local guides and all. It went great. Both the treasure and monster were created on the fly. In the end it was something like Pitch Black meet Conan's Red Nails with a desert, a giant undead siren bat and people hidding inside a ancient underground city not to be caught by it's song.<br/><br/>Some things I  noticed about the system :<br/>- the out of combat conflict system is one of the clearer stakes exposition system for traditional players. At least for my friends, who are used to very traditional simulationist game designs. They totaly get the thing that failing your roll is not necessarily failing the action itself but adding complications. I love it.<br/>- there's no possibility that your narration or ressources can modify your roll on out of combat conflict, like you do with awesome tokens in combat. Combined with the clear stakes system it doesn't seem to be a problem because I don't bother the players with deprotagonizing stupid action botches but rather add complication to the action. But I wondered if I was in line with Eric's design intentions.<br/>- there's something with the XP value of the monsters. I now  have pretty powerfull PCs at the table and I have to make realy big monsters for them to be a challenge. Monsters XP value comes from their stats and number of powers. And you don't share the XP value among the players. So the monster value increases greatly with the number of PCs and their power level. The result is that XP awards goes greater and greater. It seems to me that it was longer and harder for my players to get their PC's from level 1 to 2 than 2 to 3. Just an observation. I still need to play more to confirm.<br/>- the most powerfull individual combat powers, I think, are those that allow you to make one show-off action and one attack action in the same round.Yari master qualifies for me as the strongest of them all. Same thing with the monster power "Vicious". Two of the PCs were "Yari masters" and there could be a problem. It seems that other options get neglected : there's less Assist actions, less move actions to get the weapon bonus and the weapons tend to be all "reach weapons" to use with this talent. I think that what made my monsters so powerfull in my last game was that they had the "vicious" power.<br/>- given the problem above, 10 HP for my monsters were barrely enough and both monsters never went after the second or third round. When I put the monsters stats in the gallery thread, you'll see with I call that a problem.<br/><br/>Besides that, great games as always. The players don't cease to tell me how they feel "free" in this game, free to take bold action courses, to realy be larger than life adventurers and to try big things.<br/>I credit the combination of great character's options, clear stakes system, engaging fight mecanism and sound play advices (for me they compare with Trollbabe's advices). The hack is realy not a dungeon delving pastiche.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Antoine                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125683/#Comment_125683" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T04:01:41+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  4:01AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hiya Antoine.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>there's no possibility that your narration or ressources can modify your roll on out of combat conflict, like you do with awesome tokens in combat.

It's looking like the two-action Talents are the ones that are causing the most issues right now.  I'm fiddling around with different ideas for improving them.  I suspect that what I'll end up doing is making each of them a little more restrictive with what you can do to earn your bonus action.  For example, Yari Master may end up being two attacks with a reach weapon, instead of an attack plus anything else.</p>\n<p>As for everyone taking Yari Master... I advocate doing the same thing that I'd do when players end up taking any single Talent over and over again - be mean to them.  If the players are all taking reach weapons, and you're getting bored with that, well then narrate in a bunch of Tight arenas and give all the monsters &amp; NPCs Tiny weapons.  See how they like being stabbed in the face by 3d10+2 over and over again.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the players will want to narrate in their own Hazardous arenas.  Cool.  That means they'll have to move to get to those arenas.  Then you can hit them from a distance with your NPCs that are carrying ranged weapons.  That'll make them move into another arena!</p>\n<p>I wouldn't sweat the XP thing too much.  I knew when I wrote in the 'no splitting' rule that this would happen.  It just means that larger groups of PCs will accellerate toward retirement faster.</p>\n<p>Groovy stuff, man.  Thanks for sharing your experiences yet again.  I'm really very happy that your friends are enjoying it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125778/#Comment_125778" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T10:25:02+00:00" title="February 11, 2008 10:25AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to also say that the non-combat "danger roll" system is pretty much my favorite game mechanic right now.

Perhaps some other playtester could confirm the problem with the two actions talents before it gets changed, but for me, with two attacks instead of one attack + any other action, it seems more workable.<br/><br/>By the way, the players didn't conspire to take this talent because it was THE talent and all, but it just happened that with two PCs possessing it, I often had to cope with characters with 3 awesome tokens + attack on the first round... With that 10 Hit Points can vanish like they were never here in the first place. I think the next monster power I'll test as a reply to that is "Throw".<br/><br/>To John : I am not surprised that you like the "Dangers of action" system for it reminds me of the "Obstacle Contests" from Agon. It's what I thought the first time I read it in the RBH. And it is realy one of the neatest mecanisms in Agon.<br/><br/>To Ryan : thanks for the maths. It's realy interesting and I have no patience to do that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Also, I just re-read the Danger system and I thought about something. Until now I almost always use some kind of complication as a danger and very rarely mere failure. I wonder if it can't be frustrating to go through, say, two dangers, pass both tests and fail on the last one. Instead, if failure is possible, wouldn't it be interesting to test it right away and, should the player fail this test, let him have the possibility to pass two more danger tests and win if he passes both. In a kind of Trollbabe's reroll way. What do you think, Eric ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125853/#Comment_125853" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T14:56:06+00:00" title="February 11, 2008  2:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2008 2:56PM by Eric Provost.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I dunno.
