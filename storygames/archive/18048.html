What happens if a Selkie has Sex with a virgin?<br/>2. A few of the PCs are running for class president. How do i keep this interesting. They basically have the day and the party in the evening to get people to vote for them. Their "friends" will probarbly vote for them but half the class is undecided. <br/>Of course you have to manipulate people into voting for you by doing stuff for them they want - this is clear to me. How should i present loyalties to my players? Should i just write down who is voting for who on the homeroom table and change it if it changes? <br/><br/>There are 3 ways i could go with this i think<br/>1. players have full information<br/>2. Only i as a MC will know who wants to vote for whom<br/>3. Should i just write down people that have "locked" their vote (for now) and present people that are unsure with question marks, meaning that i would have to still keep track by myself. <br/><br/>Idealy it would come down to the vote of the one PC that isn't running but this probarbly won't happen... <br/>Making a custom move for this is weird and leaving it to chance too.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407570/#Comment_407570" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T05:06:27+00:00" title="February 28, 2013  5:06AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am sorry if my post is not completely understandable...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407572/#Comment_407572" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T05:42:22+00:00" title="February 28, 2013  5:42AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would go with this:<br/>Whoever convinces the most people to vote for them, in-game / in scenes, should win and become class president. The vampire gets three NPCs to vote for her, and then the Fae gets four NPCs to vote for him? The Fae is voted class president. Don't bother keeping track of the whole class or whatever, that's just a bunch of book keeping for you to do when you could be thinking up cool scenes, or just thinking about certain characters in general. Make the game about the characters that are actually in the scenes being played.<br/><br/>But if somebody cheats, they should win instead. If they didn't convince the most amount of people in scenes that were played though, everybody should probably suspect they cheated because like, duh, <i>obviously</i> Krissy won, I mean <i>god</i>, like EVerybody said they voted for her, right?

But who is playing this game? You and your principles? You got 4 players, the game should be about their characters.<br/><br/>Now I say this not knowing anything about them. So maybe they are interested in the vote breakdown, who voted for who, all that stuff. But I would assume that if they care about becoming class president either they want to just get voted in right away so they can start doing presidential stuff, or they are interested in actually struggling with each other to get it. In the first case, you might as well just make a decision and get on with playing. In the second, you should focus on what they're doing to get it, and those actions should be consequential.<br/><br/>Also, remember you have a responsibility to keep the story feral. It's supposed to be spontaneous. If planning all that stuff out is a springboard for improv and that's your style, it could work. If it's going to get you set on something and it'll be just like running a D&amp;D module for the players, then don't make any concrete decisions until they actually matter in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407607/#Comment_407607" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T11:38:56+00:00" title="February 28, 2013 11:38AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I'll opine about the Selkie's sexual encounter question ; )<br/><br/>It was intended to state that whomever the Selkie has sex with *obviously already had sex with someone else*, as sort of an additional fiction-creating move. When this is with an NPC, I'd say let that be the case, even if that's surprising with that particular NPC. Let it be with a surprising person, too.<br/><br/>If you don't want to go that route, or it's a PC who's stated that they've never had sex before, maybe one of these:<br/><br/> \u2022 Consider the basic sexual unit to be "1" instead of "2." Though PCs won't be able to fire off their sex moves solo (or...?), this particular instance would result in the Selkie getting a String on the person they're having sex with directly. This doesn't seem mechanically exciting to me, but it's a legit reading.<br/><br/>\u2022 How about the Short Bus quote "voyeurism is participation"? Maybe this virgin has watched someone else have sex, and the String is generated on that other (or one of those others).<br/><br/>\u2022 Definitely play around with what "sex" is, and what "virginity" is. What "counts" as sex is open to interpretation - unless, of course, there's a Unicorn in the game. If that's so, you've got to interpret using their rules.<br/><br/>\u2022 If they're really just a virgin and that's that, let the mechanics fizzle and take the opportunity to ask questions of the Selkie (Wow, this person has never had sex before - does that freak you out? What emotions are you feeling in that absence of information [about who else they've had sex with]?) and maybe kick off some awkward pillow talk between Selks and the sexual partner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407613/#Comment_407613" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T12:55:41+00:00" title="February 28, 2013 12:55PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting questions!<br/><br/>I like Johnstone's suggestion, but here are some others:<br/><br/>1. Just treat it like an MC move. When it comes up, decide what seems most interesting or dramatic and go with that. <br/><br/>This could seem unfair to the players, of course, if they're all really invested in the victory. However, that can be mitigated if there was some cheating involved: so-and-so won because this person did something crazy/because someone rigged the election!<br/><br/>This doesn't necessarily resolve their competition, but generates new story material ("Did Angie intentionally miscount the votes? Why did she do that?").<br/><br/>2. Organize the characters into groups, based on cliques or stereotypes or where they sit in the class. Treat the groups as single units, so assume all the students who are part of a group vote together. So, if you can get Caroline to vote for you, all her groupies almost certainly will, too.<br/><br/>3. Make it a contest between the characters to see who's willing to go the furthest to get this. Jeff promised to take off his shirt in front of everyone if he's elected. Will Agatha be willing to offer the same in order to compete with him?<br/><br/>Whoever makes the most dramatic action or sacrifice, that person wins.<br/><br/>This could also be settled before the vote actually happens: one easy way to win a vote is to make sure your opponent gets disqualified, humiliated, can't make it on the day of the vote, etc.<br/><br/>4. If there are only 10 students, you could actually handle each character's vote individually. When a PC interacts with someone and does something for them/to them, that NPC will now vote in their favour. You don't have to make it explicit, just hint at it. If someone wants that to change, they have get to that person before someone else does, or get to them last.<br/><br/>For the ones who are not certain, they vote with their closest friend, or they roll a die to decide.<br/><br/>Finally:<br/><br/>I think your idea to bias it whenever possible to an even vote which could be broken by the extra PC is a good "principle" to go by whenever you're otherwise unsure how someone should vote.<br/><br/>Maybe:<br/><br/>* Keep the race as tight as possible.<br/>* Disclaim responsibility by leaving it up to the PCs voting, if possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407614/#Comment_407614" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T12:58:46+00:00" title="February 28, 2013 12:58PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>\u2022 How about the Short Bus quote "voyeurism is participation"?
