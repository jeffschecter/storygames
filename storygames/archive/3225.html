I hadn't really noticed until I moved to Wisconsin. I got into a gaming group that seemed like what I was used to and it turned out to be very different. What the hell am I talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\nUntil recently all my going on 30 years of gaming has been in what I will call "Only we play" groups. What I mean by this is when new players were introduced there was a period of time where someone in the group could say, "I don't like the way the new guy/gal plays." The new person was then told by the gm that the group didn't want to play with them. Typically in a bit more sensitive language. I have friends that I don't game with and this is a spoken thing. I've know people who I perfectly liked who I just couldn't game with.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow what I've recently encountered is what I would characterize as "Everyone plays." These groups play together even though they may not be having fun. Even when introducing someone else causes the group a lot of consternation. These groups seem to value inclusion over game play. I don't mean this to be insulting. Being considerate of someones ego is a value. A good group of this nature will create their game so everyone gets their moment to shine. So there's a combat for Fred, and a social scene with the king for Mike. In a good group of this nature folks will allow the other people to have their moment. In a bad group people will clash because they don't realize it's someone elses moment. Fred attacks the King denying Mike his social drama scene. These less well working groups seem to spend an immense amount of time trying to bring Fred, or Mike around.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow none of this is likely new to most of you folks. My assholeness has likely insulated me from everyone plays groups because I just wouldn't like that I didn't know how to play, as the standard of play was unclear. This means I would just quit that group after one or two sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... to the point. I got a lot of traffic from the loudest of the reactionary boards for the Ron Edwards interview I did, which I found surprising. They actually had the most interest. Seeing all the traffic I went and read through the thread to see if there were problems I could fix as I thought that would be a site that wouldn't try to be polite over honest in giving me feedback. I didn't encounter anything notable to fix, but I was surprised. The board had the laughable personalities raging behind their pen names talking about tyrannicide, war, and taking down names. Eh. My name is right at the top of my posts, I back my words. I expected these people. There were also people who were very earnest, who I could understand some of their points. I didn't expect them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis made me wonder if some of the back and forth is actually because of this difference in group formation. The earnest folks, and laughable ones too, being Everybody plays folks with functional groups? I could see if we have fun with Fred and Mike, how someone saying we should focus on one type of play would cause me to address their ideas with resistance. I could see how games designed to facilitate one type of play would be frustrating as they would make it difficult to support Fred and Mike.  I can see how someone telling me I shouldn't let Fred or Mike play because of agenda clash would make me angry. I don't see where the denial of Fred and Mike's different desires for play is coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder where are most of you folks coming from? Only we play, or everybody plays? Do you think I'm catching on to something here? Is this a plainly obvious thing no one thought to fill me in on as it was... plainly obvious?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73373/#Comment_73373" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T13:07:45+00:00" title="June  2, 2007  1:07PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group is primarily friends.

So, if you come to this from the Big Model being your only theory and analysis of RPGs background, yeah, this "should" be news. <br><br>But, to be more specific: I have *always* played with friends. Sometimes this has meant perfectly-aligned goals. Sometimes this has meant conflicting goals. Usually it has meant differing-but-meshing goals. I don't think any group i've ever been in has asked someone to leave due to playstyle issues, but i've certainly left groups voluntarily due to playstyle issues, and i suspect that's why some of the other dropouts dropped out. And while we've occasionally had problems due to not recognizing differing goals, we've never had a problem with people deliberately ignoring or blocking others' [recognized] goals. If anything, the problem usually swings the other way: people unnecessarily block fulfillment of their own goals, for fear of getting in other people's way.<br><br>Where this causes the conversational conflict, IMHO, is not in the situation, but the solution. It seems pretty clear to me that Ron (and other creators of the Big Model, and specifically the GNS parts, because that's what this issue is most relevant to) has played in groups with non-aligned goals. His conclusion is/was that the solution is to not play in such groups. My conclusion is that the non-aligned goals aren't the problem, the conflicts are, so you need to figure out how to eliminate the conflicts, while allowing people to have differing goals of play. <br><br>Or, to put it more succinctly, if I want X and don't mind Y, and you want Y and don't mind X (or just want it less than Y), we aren't actually in conflict (despite the Big Model claiming we are). It's only when i want !Y, and you want Y that we have a problem. IME, the vast majority of game-group conflicts are of the former type: we're differing over the proportions of jam and PB in our sandwiches, not over whether to have PB *or* J.<br><br/>But it doesn't make me angry, i just think the Big Model solution is silly and unrealistic. That is, diagnosing the problem as "we have different goals" obviously leads to the only solutions being "change goals" or "change people", but if you see the real problem as "our goals are conflicting", then another solution becomes apparent: "play such that differing goals don't cause conflicts". Not only that, but my experience has been that the synergy of differing goals, properly meshed, leads to the best gameplay i've ever had, or read about--better than well-aligned single-goal play, even. To borrow the jam-band analogy: if you sound like crap because you're not playing together, the solution isn't necessarily to replace your drummer, singer, and bassist with more guitar players, it's to use the differing abilities and sounds in a way that synergizes. Plus, if these are the players you've got, then "don't play with them" isn't much of a solution--it's just avoiding the problem. So, I don't resist the "find same-agenda players" idea on principle, but on practical grounds: IME, groups are naturally of mixed priorities, and frequently based on friendships that transcend gaming, so it seems more sensible to talk about how to deal with the conflicts in agenda, than to say "they cause problems; avoid them".<br/><br/>Hmm, i think i may have crossed the line from "explicating and clarifying" to "repeating myself", so i better stop now.<br/><br/>Ironically, I may for the first time be in an unresolvable goal-conflict. We're still trying to get to the root of the matter, and figure out if there's actually anything that one of us <i>needs</i> that the other <i>can't stand</i>. So far, i think it's just differing priorities, so we should be able to come up with a suitable compromise. <br/><br/>Oh, and as to why the compromise at all? The two players most at odds in style preferences are married, and she particularly wants to game <i>with him</i>, so pretty much rejects "let's play in two different groups" solutions out of hand. And I enjoy playing with her immensely, and have a sneaking suspicion that her dedication to the game, even one tailored to her preferences (which actually match mine quite closely), would wane if it weren't an opportunity to spend time with him, so I'd just end up losing them both. Makes more sense to me to figure out a compromise that keeps them both.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I don't mean that to be insulting. I've always played with friends also. I just can't imagine gaming for a long time and not coming across people whom you didn't boot from a group. I totally believe what you are saying, it's just outside my experience. I have friends who have been booted from a group and not taken it personally and we still enjoy each others company.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think however where you argue about finding same agenda players that you are misinterpreting the Big Model, and perhaps my contention of "Only We Play." It's true that some people only like games that reward them in a certain way, but I think most players enjoy different styles of games. If you listen to the interview I did with Ron Edwards there's a part where he says, "Story Now, my ass." when talking about playing Cutthroat and having fun with it. The idea behind GNS or Creative Agenda is to get everyone playing towards the same goals, rather than playing separate games at the same table. It seems this is where the miscommunication is happening to me, as trying to get everyone playing the same way seems to butt against "Everyone Plays."<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you found in your gaming that if the rules push towards everyone playing towards the same goals, a creative agenda, that this has caused players who don't like that style to rebel, turtle, or just be bored?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

I tend to intro story games to most of the people I game with.<br><br>Although I don't buy in wholesale the idea of Crative Agendas - aligning out expectations about how and why we're playing this game - they do tend to describe much of the gaming dysfunction I have encountered.

But I remember not wanting to have anything to do with gaming and glad to be rid of the hobby, after enduring hours of non-fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74258/#Comment_74258" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T12:49:22+00:00" title="June  7, 2007 12:49PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't agree.
