I played DW tonight (new rules), and getting XP was hard. I was a LVL 1 Evil Wizard (mark XP when you bind or control something using magic), and it was too tricky. It was a puzzle: "How do I bind/control something with Identify, Magic Missile, or Invisibility?" I felt like I had to maneuver the situation towards getting my XP, as opposed to acting a certain way or approaching a situation in a certain way. I wanted XP to be a carrot to act a certain way in a situation, or attack the problem in a certain way, and it felt like I had to be in the right situation with the right tools to gain my XP, which felt like too much.<br/><br/>I dunno, maybe Judd's idea of <a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/dungeon-world-xp/" rel="nofollow">Dungeon XP</a> is a good way to go? I feel like there needs to be a middle ground between immediate action-based XP (I gain it when I roll STR) and situational maneuvering. I've read all the XP hacks/ideas out there (I think), and I'm not sure anything quite does it for me, though <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2011/10/dw-xp-experiment/" rel="nofollow">Ryan's</a> comes closest. Maybe there just needs to be more, like the Evil Wizard has three ways to gain XP instead of one (mark XP when you use magic for your own gain, mark XP when you display how magic has corrupted you, etc.).<br/><br/>I guess I'm not looking for new XP ideas or rehashing the old ones, but more: does XP in (new) Dungeon World feel this way to you? Like a situation-maneuvering puzzle? Maybe it was just a weird one-off experience.<br/><br/>(as a note, to those who might ask: I didn't mark XP at all during the session, even w/ the end-of-session moves. Only one person did--the neutral thief--so it may have been the adventure--Spanterhook--I dunno).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358608/#Comment_358608" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T02:10:37+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  2:10AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Hans, I've read Judd's xp idea and I thought that his ideas on xp for bonds, xp for treasure / dungeon challenges / monsters have been incorporated into the new rules? You don't JUST get xp for alignment moves.... Bonds, exploration, killing monsters and getting loots all score some xp too. I really like your extra alignment moves for an evil wizard, I'd totally allow those as XP worthy if you selected them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't get that you didn't do ANY of the prompts listed for xp in the end of session move? In the spanterhook?! Surely you explored / killed notable thieves / found awesome loots?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I still like and will use the Key type xp ideas from the BBC crew.

Giving an explicit trigger for which you gain XP (which was done with Alignment but not with Bonds, for some reason) just feels more like an actual rule to me.<br/><br/>For my buck, the "perfect" XP system in DW would be Alignments as they are, Bonds as Judd envisions them, End of Session questions as written, and BBC XP (with easy-to-remember icons for each type of Move, like crossed swords for Attack, a shield for Defend, a speech bubble for Converse, a magnifying glass for Discover, two right hands doing the Beast Hunters salute for Aid, and...something for stunt. I dunno, the jackass symbol of a helmet with crossed crutches comes to mind, even though it's wildliy out of place). The Dungeon XP really sounds like an alternate rule to me, and falls flat as a standard for gaining XP.<br/><br/>Under this system, I would expect these triggers to occur in order of most to least: BBC XP&gt;Alignment/Bonds&gt;EoS Questions&gt;(Dungeon XP). And I'd keep the level +7 for the level-up amount, because x10 was always going to be ludicrous, given that you don't gain more XP as the game progresses like you do in D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358633/#Comment_358633" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T06:07:00+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  6:07AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read Judd's XP hack yet so it may fall right in line with what I'm doing but I am going to start handing out XP for acting on Bonds in a session. The goal is to get the players to bring up their bonds during the session and work towards resolving them by rewarding them in the moment.

The Move I am toying with looks something like this:<br/><br/>When you bring up a Bond in conversation or act in accordence with a Bond mark XP. <br/><br/>I'm also toying around with a move that allow players to build Bonds in play:<br/><br/>When you create a new connection with a character and describe how you relate to them Roll + CHA:<br/>On a 10+ you create a new bond with them based on the connection you described; on a 7-9 they create a Bond with you with their perspective on the connection; on a miss no Bond is created.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358656/#Comment_358656" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T08:59:00+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  8:59AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I'm leaning more and more towards mission-based or Burning Wheel-style end of session XP.  There's something to be said for Key-style XP, where the XP system helps remind you of what you character is about and how they should approach problems, but honestly -- if you're leading with the fiction all the time -- that should be less of a problem, I think, and more of a distraction, since you have to do a lot of fictional maneuvering to hit your XP conditions, as Hans points out.<br/><br/>However, if you get XP at the end of the session/mission, after you've actually accomplished something, that fits in well with the natural "spent loot" / "buy new gear" / "rest" part of the cycle of play that already exists in dungeon-y games.  Sure, you can't level up just in time to beat the crap out of the demon lord, but that's always felt a bit artificial anyway (and leveling up in the middle of a fight can take time, if it's more than just "extra HP + pick a new move").<br/><br/>Consequently, I want to try out lowering XP requirements (like level + 2) and only giving out XP at the end of sessions: for completing missions and "having played your alignment" during the session (that's also, per the new rules, a great chance to change your alignment, whether you got XP for it or not).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358741/#Comment_358741" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T14:06:35+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  2:06PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some thoughts on XP:<br/><br/>We're fine tuning all the starting Alignments (and the new ones you can switch to) to make sure they're possible and not disruptive. <br/><br/>Judd's XP conditions from Bonds are pretty close to resolving them, which we are adding examples of. "________ has magic in them that they have not yet tapped into; I will show it to them" is resolved when they learn to tap into that magic, when you give up in disgust of their ignorance, when they take you as their master to continue trying to unlock the power, anything that means the Bond has been dealt with. There's now a cycle to bonds where there's a reason to pursue them, deal with them, and form new ones.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of BBC XP myself. It's an improvement on stat highlighting, but I think we're beyond the highlighting idiom.<br/><br/>Our feedback so far has been that the end of session questions are getting hit by most groups, with two being hit in most sessions. I'd be interested in hearing about the sessions where that isn't happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358783/#Comment_358783" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-10T17:15:10+00:00" title="February 10, 2012  5:15PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2012 7:28PM by Noofy.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played last night with the Beta Rules as written.

My personal preference and how we have played the game has been more focused on the perilous action and fighting dangerous monsters portion of dungeon crawling, for that I like an advancement system more keyed into the actions like the BBC hack we came up with.

Bonds are a pleasant diversion along the quest that add color and roleplay, but the GM has a scarcity of tools that deal with character interaction directly. Placing Bonds front and center makes dungeon delving a sideshow.<br/><br/>I like the BBC system for this, but those starting alignments are going in a good direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359013/#Comment_359013" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T23:40:24+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 11:40PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2012 11:40PM by Hans_c-o.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><br/>Also, alignment keys really need to be flagged to the GM so that they can play to them.

I stuck with the XP system as given though, even if I did re-incorporate the Loot Move and our own 'circles' variant move.<br/>\nBut...... The one thing I did dredge up from the old Apoc D&amp;D days (such an old skool MC man) was my hack to reward player motivation and roleplay with bennies instead of xp. I stole the idea of 'awesome dice' from Old Skool Hack and combined it with the BBC keys. So when one of the players did something they had nominated (or had been nominated by the GM) as their key and would normally have marked xp, they now grabbed an awesome d6. They could then use that die to add to any roll thereafter (or after the roll) and choose which ever two results they wanted for the move.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis had some remarkably interesting effects on play. The 'lizard brain' wanted bennies. The awesome dice became little jewels of want want want for the players. It sorta helped that they were Q-workshop translucent elvish, dwarvish, runic, draconic and tribal d6s! I specifically choose keys (in my DM allocation) that were not part of the player's normal 'style'; Sketchy the thief was marked with 'stunt' and 'converse', Arwen with 'attack' and 'discover'. I had to be very present in the conversation, reminding the players to do it, do it. They really wanted to acquire and spend awesome dice, and it would have been all too easy to have become way more D&amp;D tactical and mechanical about it, ignoring the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's not why we play Dungeon World! I stuck true to my principles and insisted that the moves stem from the narration. It lead to a very action packed and move-snowbally sort of game, where I hardly ever had to make a move to advance the fiction from the 'blank-look' syndrome. My moves always seemed to be in response to player moves or failed rolls, it was rather un-relenting! We had the interesting experience whereby a player indulged in some fictional 'key' behaviour to achieve an awesome die and then used that awesome die ensuring a 10+ for an aid/interfere move, resulting in the resolution of a Bond, thus gifting her with an xp. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all it was a successful iteration of an odd 'add-on' that I just can't seem to let go of. I Love giving players in game rewards that are far more than just a +1 forward. Something tied to what they are doing and where they want to go. It wasn't perfect but it worked just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359029/#Comment_359029" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T05:24:55+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  5:24AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Another more-frequent-XP hack: award end-of-session XP as part of the Make Camp or Carousing moves.</blockquote>\nI like this one a lot.

Or some space to make up your own.  Just as players will create new bonds to reflect the fictions, so they might create new alignment XP triggers.  Say the neutral wizard discovers a secret about a magical artifact in such a way that there's not much mytsery left, but there's a lot of room for pursuing and claiming the artifact.  Maybe they temporarily switch to or add on another trigger, "when you make significant progress towards claiming the artifact".  Basically, a Key that still feeds into the archetype.  Because that's what all these class+alignments XP moves seem to be, ways to focus on a set of classic D&amp;D archetypes.  Otherwise we'd just have a list of Keys that people took at will.  My paladin is *totally* about uncovering magical mysteries, so they can either be estroyed or harnessed for the good of the people.  Another advancement option!  "Different Drummer: replace your alignment move with a move from another playbook."<br/><br/>I'd like to see the bonds more tied to the fiction, perhaps because I'm into one shots with a specific scenario.  I think they would affect the fiction more in an ongoing game.  Something like:t he characters are searching for a kidnapped prince.  One bond is that two of the characters are in a love triangle with him.  Another is that one character is a royalist, while another is trying to convince her to join the revolution.  etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359046/#Comment_359046" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T08:41:47+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  8:41AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2012 11:45AM by mease19.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, I dig your idea of a session-specific custom bond moves, such as:<br/>When you <b>agree to rescue the prince</b>, choose one of the bonds below and answer any questions the GM asks:<br/>-When you compete for the prince's love, mark XP.<br/>-When you put your loyalty to the crown above all else, mark XP.<br/>-When you protect what you know about the prince[ss], mark XP<br/>-When you bring others into the fold of the revolution, mark XP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359050/#Comment_359050" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-12T09:39:19+00:00" title="February 12, 2012  9:39AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that a lot.
