Any two cents are valued--constructive criticism only, please.<br/><br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://buyjewelrybeads.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/pony-beads.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The core conceit is that each player has a bag filled with beads--same shape and size, different colors. (I use pony beads, cheap and plentiful.) The core mechanic is the draw, analogous to a die roll in most games: the player pulls 3-5 beads from the bag, either comparing them to an established target, or interpreting them in some less quantified manner.<br/><br/>Here's some background, by way of showing what I <i>don't</i> want: back in 2005 or so, I was using the beads like Fate dice, where each color simply provided a stat modifier (+0s and +1s were common, +4s and +5s were rare). Experience points could add certain colors to the bag, thereby tweaking your character's actual success probabilities, or fate. This felt nifty enough in 2005, but feels like last week's leftovers now.<br/><br/>My current goal is to make filling the bag of beads the hot tech of character creation. This could occur in turns around the table, or players could choose an archetype with a certain allotment of starting beads and then purchase additional ones at the cost of black (consequence) beads also being added... there are several ways this could work.<br/><br/>Here's my current frustration: <b>what could these beads stand for</b>, both in character creation, and when drawn? I'm using 9 colors right now: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, White, Clear, and Black. With 6 colors and 3... <i>not</i> colors(?), it's tempting to go with 6 stats and 3 narrative triggers, like this:<br/><br/>-------------------------<br/>Red - Careful<br/>Orange - Clever<br/>Yellow - Flashy<br/>Green - Forceful<br/>Blue - Quick<br/>Violet - Sneaky<br/>-------------------------<br/>White - Wild (any color)<br/>Clear - Narrative Privilege<br/>Black - Consequence<br/>-------------------------<br/><br/>No, I don't want to use the FAE approaches particularly, but they're holding place for now. You could easily do STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA.<br/><br/>So, let's say you rank your 6 stats from 1-6, and get an appropriate number of starting beads:<br/><br/>--------------------------------<br/>Red - Careful - 30<br/>Orange - Clever - 25<br/>Yellow - Flashy - 20<br/>Green - Forceful - 15<br/>Blue - Quick - 10<br/>Violet - Sneaky - 5<br/>--------------------------------<br/>White - Wild (any color) - 2<br/>Clear - Narrative Privilege - 2<br/>Black - Consequence - 10<br/><br/>Then you can spend some of those, or take on additional black (consequence) beads, to purchase whites and clears, which cost 2 for colors, only 1 for blacks.<br/><br/>--------------------------------<br/>Red - Careful - 29<br/>Orange - Clever - 24<br/>Yellow - Flashy - 19<br/>Green - Forceful - 14<br/>Blue - Quick - 9<br/>Violet - Sneaky - 0<br/>--------------------------------<br/>White - Wild (any color) - 8<br/>Clear - Narrative Privilege - 8<br/>Black - Consequence - 17<br/>--------------------------------<br/><br/>Okay, so how do tasks and conflicts work? Let's start with tasks: you pick your approach (going with the FAE model for now), or work out with the GM which stat will be most relevant, and make a 5-bead draw, trying to <b>show</b> 1, 2, or 3 of that color, depending on the difficulty/complexity of the task. With the numbers above, this is pretty tough, except for two things: the wild beads can be any color, and you can <b>spend</b> beads to achieve success. So, if you need 3 reds to carefully trail a suspect, but you only <b>show</b> 1 in your draw, you can <b>spend</b> it, scoring the necessary 3, but you never get it back. Perhaps you could even spend off-color beads to achieve lower levels or different types of success than you were aiming for.<br/><br/>*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *<br/><br/>Well, that's enough for now. Let me try to list what I'm struggling with:<br/><br/>* How to do character creation: archetypes, or...?<br/>* What do the beads signify? Must they be stats, identical across all characters, or could they be generated by each player individually? If the latter, how would task resolution work, i.e., how could the GM set difficulties when all the character traits are different? Could it just be subjective resolution? "I hope to give a good impression to the stranger, so I draw 5 and try to hit X number of Y color, which is my Outstanding Personality."<br/>* Is any of this fun?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463796/#Comment_463796" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T22:24:04+00:00" title="June  9, 2017 10:24PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spitballing here...<br/><br/>What about colours=emotions? So creating your character means defining their emotional beats, e.g:<br/>Red (Anger) = 30<br/>Orange (Happiness) = 25<br/>Yellow (Fear) = 20<br/>Green (Envy) = 15<br/>Blue (Sadness) = 10<br/>Violet (Desire) = 5<br/><br/>You could further define each emotion by assigning it a unique trait for your character, so I might have Anger (Fight) but you might have Anger (Intimidate) or some such. Performing an action is then about pulling beads from the bag that match the emotional state of your character, with extra beads being drawn when using the trait associated with that emotion and the Black, White and Clear beads being wild as before.<br/><br/>You could also do this with far fewer beads per bag, if you just need one bead of the right colour to succeed; there could even be a 'colour wheel' option, that allows you to shift your emotional state one step clockwise or anti-clockwise to rescue a partial success from what would otherwise be a failure. For example, I try to pull a Red bead for Anger (Fight) but if I only get an Orange bead, then I can switch to Happiness (Make a bargain) instead and take a lesser level of success instead of a total failure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463797/#Comment_463797" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T22:43:14+00:00" title="June  9, 2017 10:43PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm down with the idea of beads representing whatever aspects/characteristics/traits are fundamental to your game's theme...<br/><br/>Regarding character creation, what about a series of questions that subtly reveal the character's moral fiber (or whatever)? Each one could have, say, three different answers, and each answer corresponds to a certain number/type of beads that are added to the bag.

Maybe some sort of system where choosing to override your detrimental pulls means discarding beads that correspond to a certain attribute, which means you can't call on it later on when you need it, and may even result into a kind of spiral of moral depravity as the character discards her ideological underpinnings in the pursuit of a goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463798/#Comment_463798" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-09T22:57:51+00:00" title="June  9, 2017 10:57PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2017 11:00PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you have different "moves" or actions you can make in your game, you can associate those with the colours, too.

I had already started developing a game that I brainstormed up,  when I start thinking about this thread, based on this exact emotional color wheel that I'd googled. I'm sure the rest of my game that I thought up is different however. It's just kind of funny or mind  with the same direction. I think what you're doing with the colors and emotions is different from what I'm doing. I'm using them to define how the characters play out the scenes; that is, the bead they draw is the emotion they have in the scene and this is used as their inspiration for framing  and acting out the scene.  It's a fairly simple game, and it's pretty much completely figured out mechanically, even the other parts. I didn't want to get too into it because I was going to start play testing it, and didn't want others to go in the same direction. But I guess the cats out of the bag now. I can delineate the rest the rules of people want, but I am going to use them at my own universal Story Game,  and start play testing them soon to see how they work out. I can't believe you even googled the same color wheel, haha.  I am changing stuff about the color wheel though to make the play more practical and work better. Anyway, I'll probably write up the rules, and put them up in the thread so others are aware of them <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463857/#Comment_463857" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-12T01:07:27+00:00" title="June 12, 2017  1:07AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting confluence of the minds!<br/><br/>Jeff, your idea of drawing colours for emotional state in scene framing is very interesting.

Check out my outline of the game at the link below, and ask me any questions or clarifications you want.

The title immediately makes me think of the game from the Hermann Hesse book:<br/><br/><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/abimepublications/home" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/site/abimepublications/home</a><br/><br/>...but I'm not proposing adapting that as a story game!<br/><br/>1) Including negative consequences in the bag gives each draw a Dread-type feel. Sure, you'll probably succeed but...there is a risk every time you exert yourself. And without replacement, the risk could grow with each draw.<br/><br/>The consequence beads could just be negatives in a mechanical sense (-1), but I like the idea that they scale up in potency if they clump up. So when you draw a fistfull of beads, and count up the negatives:<br/><br/>1 black bead: nothing bad (but nothing good...just a lost bead)<br/>2 black beads: minor consequence (scene complication)<br/>3 black beads: major consequence (session complication)<br/>...<br/><br/>You could give players discretion in how "hard" they try (how many beads they draw). So trying harder might raise your chances of success at the given task, but it also raises your chances of disaster. So how desperate are you?<br/><br/>2) How often is the bag refreshed? Do you add beads back every draw, or is it only replenished after a narrative action such as rest?<br/><br/>I like the idea of mapping fatigue onto the bag. If only rest replenishes the bag, then at some point you'll run empty and won't be able to perform pulls without rest. And if you're adding consequences as you go and not replenishing with other beads, the probability of consequence keeps going up.<br/><br/>3) What adds negative consequences into the bag? Mechanically, you could have them represent character stress from over-exertion (running, combat, magic). Perhaps the player makes a draw and comes up short, but has the option of drawing additional beads...at the cost of adding a consequence bead.<br/><br/>But are consequences permanent (go back into bag) or just experienced once? I was assuming that they never reenter the bag, at which point they aren't that bad unless they start clumping up.<br/><br/>Of course, you could use two colors of beads for consequences: permanent (black?) and singleton (grey?). A permanent consequence bead would be pretty painful.<br/><br/>4) What adds positive beads? Presumably this is an XP kind of reward system. And if the colors mark approaches or traits, then adding a particular color is similar to advancing that ability or skill. But do players just buy them with XP, or are they rewarded for using an approach or ability well by getting more of that ability? Or there could be Lady Blackbird-style character keys, or moral consequences for taking an easy but immoral choice.<br/><br/>5) I agree with Jeph that "Try to draw at least n beads of $COLOR" isn't much different than a dice roll. But instead of declaring your approach and then drawing against that, what if you drew first and then had to work out your actions with whatever approach beads you drew?<br/><br/>This removes some player agency and forces some improv, but could give an interesting "molded by circumstances" flavor to character development. Maybe the player designed his character as a big lug (many Forceful beads, few Quick), but at the crucial moment of the session somehow draws a fistfull of Quick? The player had something else in mind, but now he has to roll with what he's given. If the player pulls it off, maybe the character learned something about himself and should be rewarded with more Quick.<br/><br/><br/>Nickel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
