I'm putting it here to see what people think. I think it's fun and could facilitate story gaming. <br/><br/>Wizards of the Coast has republished the AD+D books from the late 70's. My wife will be giving me the Player's Handbook and Monster Manual. All of which has got me interested in role playing again. When that happens ideas start popping into my head. Here is one...<br/><br/>The players choose whither they want to run a fighter, wizard, cleric or thief. they have one stat - Defense. They start with a base seven but can alter that up or down based on having more armor, skill, or magic. That has to be worked out. The stat is used differently based on the situation.<br/><br/>COMBAT!<br/><br/>When a player attacks another player they roll two six-sided dice and try to roll equal to or over the defense number. When they hit the hurt player's defense is dropped by one. So as people get injured they are easier to hit and get killed. There is a cascade effect so people can see that they will lose long before it happens. Maybe that will make them run away or try to solve things in other ways than by fighting.<br/><br/>I can also see players describing how they are fighting and the Game Master giving them plus and minuses to rolls based on the story telling. Maybe an ambush would do more than one hit for instance.<br/><br/>MAGIC!<br/><br/>Wizards and clerics have a list of spells that they can cast. To successfully cast them they need to roll above the defense number. This means that spell casters will likely opt to weak less armor and have fewer hits so they have a better shot at conjuring.<br/><br/>This also means that as wizards are wounded they become more dangerous!<br/><br/>Back a wizard in a corner and they can come back at you with a kick ass spell as their final strike so taking them out is VERY dangerous. Maybe they get bigger effects of spells by giving themselves negative dice modifiers so when they are nearly dead they can do safely.<br/><br/>THIEVING!<br/><br/>Thieves also roll above their defense score to pull off feats of daring do. Thus thieves will wear less armor and have rougeish hats with big feathers.<br/><br/>SOME SKILL ROLLS<br/><br/>Some skill rolls like climbing, swimming, etc. might also use a roll over the defense score to succeed so heavily armored men don't go trying to do long jumps or other acrobatic feats.<br/><br/>THE GAME IN PLAY<br/><br/>The game could be played like D+D - with a GM saying what happens, the players making plans, and doing a lot of skill dice rolls to accomplish tasks.<br/><br/>It could also be played in a "fortune in the middle" manner, in which the players and GM talk about what is happening (maybe in a back and forth way - I do this - okay then I counter with this move...) to negotiate dice modifiers. Then they roll and the winner describes what happens.<br/><br/>It could work and might even be fun.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398853/#Comment_398853" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T09:09:29+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  9:09AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool, Chris.

Nothing wrong with that, just wanted to point it out. In Trollbabe, very character has one number they choose, from 2 to 9. Roll a d10. Anything under your number and you can hit something. Anything over your number and you can magic it. For social activities, it's the worst range + the number.<br/><br/>For example, my brute like troll babe with a 9. I can beat things up when I roll 1-8. I can magic them when I roll a 10. I can talk (or social) with a 9 and 10.<br/><br/>If I'm a more average trollbabe with a 5. 1-4 is fighting, 6-10 is magic, and 1-5 is social. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398888/#Comment_398888" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T12:51:21+00:00" title="November 27, 2012 12:51PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> It does give a very Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon effect though.

This is the crux of it really: what kind of story do you want to be telling with this game? How does your dice/card/misc task resolution system support that style of story? How does it hinder it?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398971/#Comment_398971" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T05:17:16+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  5:17AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know I'm not sure what I'd be going for. That is one of the beauties of half baked ideas - wonderful freedom of potential. For a D+D like game it has to be combat but I do like the idea of an oriental flavored game where characters jump around on wires. <br/><br/>Thanks Danger5 I didn't know that about Trollbabe. They are certainly similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
