It doesn't feel like a community at all. It feels like a cork board of advertisements with the fringe of tear-off phone numbers.<br/>What they need to do to become explosive is implement the social formula that worked for The Forge. And they have mostly the right pieces to do it.<br/><br/>The Forge became the place where folks who thought more could be done with the form of RPGs came to figure out how to do it. The Poopsheet focus on mini-comics seems exactly right to me for something similar, because mini-comics are creator-owned garage publishing analogous to the indie publishing promoted by The Forge for folks who were thinking differently than the establishment. I guess the open question is whether there are folks with that kind of pent-up creative energy (from consumer dissatisfaction?) for comics to be found. I'm not immersed in the comics scene, so Al Burian might be the only comics-related example of this kind of dissatisfaction-with-something energy I can come up with. But if it's out there, then here are some of the right pieces:\n<ul>\n<li>The Forge had a small number of reviews that got folks looking at the right aspects of games. The reviews helped folks see through the "product" to the design intent, and to start thinking themselves that more could be done with RPGs. The Poopsheet Foundation puts reviews on the front of the site via their review blog. But they're more appreciative, and encouraging of consumer behavior, than socially purposeful. And the quantity of reviews doesn't help you know where to start. They need to focus attention on a core set of socially purposeful reviews.</li>\n<li>And then they need to create forum conversations that talk about actual mini comics in the same way.</li>\n<li>They need folks actively on the forums encouraging/helping/mentoring others in creating their own mini-comics. There are folks out there doing this kind of thing. I swear I've seen mini-comics by Pam Bliss that encourage people to create their own mini-comics (but her current online catalog of available books doesn't list any such thing). Matt Feazell is an advocate as well. At one point he was running a regular comics drawing club at his house in Hamtramck, Michigan. And he's already a member on the Poopsheet forums. Will Terrell runs a regular drawing club, El Sketcho Clubbo in Lubbock, Texas. I think Poopsheet should support these clubs with a forum presence somehow, with the goal of bringing some of the visioning, sharing, and mentoring into the forums where it can naturally pull in and work for folks who have interest and creative motivation but happen to be geographically dispersed.</li>\n<li>The Forge also did a great job using contests and challenges to get folks from interested bystanders to being inspired and actually acting creatively on the inspirations. Most notable among them are the Game Chef contest, and various "24 Hour Game" challenges. And since the 24 Hour Game Challenge originated with Scott McCloud's 24 Hour Comic Challenge, it's clear the comics community is prepared to get excited by challenges and contests. I've seen massive threads of people on LiveJournal challenging each other to draw reimagined classic superhero characters. I've seen discussion forums entirely devoted to art card challenges, and sketchbook challenges. It's a convention to pass a sketchbook around among exhibitors during comics shows to end up with a collective art memorial of the show. I've seen artists redrawing covers of classic comic books, or whole books, or rescripting pages to achieve different narratives. James Kochalka and Craig Thompson have done collaboration/argument comics where they draw pages in response to each other. What do these kinds of things look like when you have a social purpose for mini-comics, and you're thinking about challenges as a way of unlocking folks who might be awesome if they were prompted with some inspiration and encouragement? I don't know the answer to that.</li>\n</ul>\nI'm a game designer. I'm not the guy to advance this in the online comics scene. But if someone did it, I can see myself making some mini-comics.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Richie" title="Richie"><img alt="Richie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Richie">Richie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332919/#Comment_332919" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T19:43:39+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  7:43PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeh, I see what you mean about poopsheet not being very "evolved". I'm working on some of my own mini-comics too. So I guess what I'm looking for (to start with) is a way to get them seen by people with an interest in the same medium. But I also want to see what other people are doing with the medium.I see comics as a powerful medium for personal expression because they can be highly articulate and be self-published relatively cheaply, although the time investment is huge.<br/><br/>Rpgs are inherently social. Comics are kind of inherently anti-social. Maybe this has something to do with the online manifestations of their respective communities. There is no audience participation in comics the way there is in rpgs. Also there are more options for cartoonists to "make it" outside of the self published indie scene. I don't know, I think the indie rpg community seems to be unusually inclusive.<br/><br/>Being in Australia I tend to be much more involved in internet communities than anything happening locally. I'm sure there's a lot collaboration and trading happening at indie comic cons in North America. I would like to see that transferred online a little more. I'm not sure how to go about that though.<br/><br/>Also a lot of people are making digital only webcomics, rather than printing anything. Which is quite a different medium. <br/><br/>I also think the range of skill and the quality of the final product is an issue with comics. I'm not trying to be elitist, but if an rpg isn't well thought out it's not likely to work very well. The same is true of comics but making that call seems more subjective where art and narrative is concerned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332950/#Comment_332950" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-03T06:53:06+00:00" title="July  3, 2011  6:53AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Richie,<br/><br/>I think Poopsheet represents a way to get your comics seen by others with an interest in mini-comics. Post a few reviews of Australian mini-comics you have to the forums, even just one or two, stuff most of the American mini-comics folks won't have ever seen, and be sure you have links to your own stuff in your signature when you do. People follow links in signatures by when someone is posting with intelligence and creative interest.<br/><br/>Or maybe also in your signature: "I'm in Australia. I'd like to trade mini-comics internationally."<br/><br/>Do you think folks making their own mini-comics is the "audience participation" opportunity of comics fandom?<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Richie" title="Richie"><img alt="Richie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Richie">Richie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333027/#Comment_333027" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-04T03:17:33+00:00" title="July  4, 2011  3:17AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Paul, <br/><br/>Good advice. I need to see more of what is around locally too. There is a small Melbourne comics scene but I'm not that into the stuff I've seen so far. It's actually harder to find out what's going on around here, distribution is haphazard and web-presence is pretty lacking. Slowly I'm starting to get a sense of it. I should spend more time working on my own stuff though, lol.<br/><br/>To answer your question I think mini-comics are the way that most indie cartoonists get started. Pre-web it was the only way to get your work out there. The designer side of me really likes the idea of printing small handmade objects that I can just drop off to the handful of zine distros that exist around town and maybe take to a show.<br/><br/>So I guess it's kind of audience participation but as soon as you start making your own work you become a producer, an insider (in some way), as well as still being a fan.<br/><br/>In rpgs there's an extra step that just isn't there in most other forms of media. When I play a game I'm not a passive consumer, so I can talk about it knowledgeably, and I am participating in it. If I wanted to go the extra mile I could design my own games but playing them is still definitely participatory. <br/><br/>Maybe there isn't as much as an imperative for comics people to meet other comics people as there is with games? I dunno.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
