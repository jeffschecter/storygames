I checked the site you linked to and also googled for a review but so far only found a short one that didn't go into lot of detail. What I want to know is stuff like: Do I have to convert pdfs or mp3s to some other format before transferring to the the Cybook or does it support those natively? How long does the battery last and how is it recharged? (Over USB? Powerbrick?) How usable is it in general?<br/><br/>Do you have one?

I just bought a (REALLY cool!!!) laptop in the last six month, so my gadget account is somewhat empty. (Of course, this might well change when I get my hands on an EEE or eReader or whatever and suddenly realize that my life has been incomplete without one. ^_^ )<br/><br/>But, besides monetary issues, a large problem I have with the whole ebook thing are the rights aspects. I don't want to license my books. I don't want my file format or my reader telling me what I can or can't do with a file. I don't want all that hassle and I don't really want to support that. So a Kindle is right out and while I'll look at other ebook readers (Like I said, I love the digital ink technology.), at the moment, the best thing for "difficult" people like me is a small-ish laptop. <br/><br/>Maybe this will change. I certainly hope it will. But we're not there yet and there are a couple of things that would need to change for me to enter the ebook reader market. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136032/#Comment_136032" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-23T10:45:01+00:00" title="March 23, 2008 10:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything Lord Minx said is spot on.<br/><br/>I've done a lot of research on the Kindle and, must as though I'm a tech-hound and gadget whore, I can't justify getting this device.  Not only it is too expensive for what it is (a problem, but not acceptable if certain folk want to be on the cutting edge) but the DRM, the lack of easy PDF/doc reading and proprietary file format just kill this for me.  I need the iPod of eBook readers -- let me buy books on pdf and let me convert any of my materials to a form I can easily access (you can do it without the Amazon charge but it's not easy or convenient).  I don't want to be beholding to Amazon re: their file format.<br/><br/>Right now, Kindle is a decent solution but not a great one.

I bought it soon after it was released in the US, and have absolutely no regrets about purchasing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've tried reading ebooks on laptops and other small portable devices (clie, etc) before.  This blows them out of the water.  Form factor wise, it's about as close to holding a book as it gets.  Everything else is either too big (laptop) or too small (pda/cellphone).  The battery performs amazingly as well.  A PDA at a few hours can't hold a candle to a device that can do 4k page turns off a charge.  The eInk screen has this kind of neutral almost paper like appearance to it that makes it much more pleasing than looking at the typical small form factor LCD screen.  It also doesn't get hot, or make any strange whine/hiss noises either, which is a nice bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been aware for ages of the huge supply of good material available for free at Gutenberg and similar sites, and have even read a few from there.  But the experience always left me wanting.  Sitting at my desk, or laying in a funky position on the couch is not the same as curling up with a book.  With a reader, you pretty much get that.  In the past, I've purchased a few books that I knew were available on Gutenberg, just because I hated reading on my laptop.  For a while, I was using the library system and their online hold functionality, but the drive back and forth became annoying.  For me, the Reader made for a good solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe different devices often do have their own proprietary native formats, but they take non-DRM'd standard formats like PDF, txt, and html as well.  Also, even as the native formats are usually proprietary, they're rarely closed; there are free and legal tools for conversion to the format.  I use libprs500 on Mac for my conversions to .lrf (the Sony Reader file format).  There's stuff out there for the mobi format, as well as a host of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only "bad" news is, these devices usually don't render PDF designed for screen very well.  If I try to read RPG PDFs I've purchased, probably 3/4 have text so small it's practically unreadable.  Resizing on the fly is not such a great option now, either (I've heard upcoming firmware to my device might solve that).  In my mind, this problem is really less that of the device than it is of current publishing practices that tie style to content.  For electronic text publishing formats, I think there needs to be a push towards a new solution (yes, I know about and use LaTex) to separate the content and style of such documents.  I mean, imagine if CSS had never done that for the web...ugh...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, short summary, if you like reading and have the cash, I'd highly recommend looking into them.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one final thought.  I know there's lots of independent publishing thinking in these parts, so just imagine for a second, if these devices were to proliferate.  You'd have an awesome new medium to deliver your product (game tomes, novels, short stories, comics...) to, direct.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136183/#Comment_136183" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T16:19:38+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  4:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very true... also, an indie publisher could release a book in both pdf and "ebook reader" pdf, or even lrf... heck, Clinton will probably just need to add a single line to his scripts to have TSOY done in lrf <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136184/#Comment_136184" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-24T16:28:44+00:00" title="March 24, 2008  4:28PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: renatoram</cite>I think it could fulfill the "almost laptop" need even better than the eeePC</blockquote>\nI don't have an eeePC, but I do have an n800.<br/><br/>I don't know that it fulfills the 'almost laptop'  better than the eeePC, but, in my experience, it fulfills that niche quite well with the addition of a travel Bluetooth keyboard (The n800 is the last-gen model that doesn't have one built in, and one is definitely needed to attain 'almost laptop' status. I don't know what using the n810's keyboard is like.) On my last big trip to Japan, I didn't bring a laptop at all, just my n800 + bluetooth keyboard, and it fully supported my roadblogging needs, probably at least as well as the eeePC could have. And when you're carrying everything on your back for two weeks, 1 lb of n800+keyboard looks pretty attractive compared to 5-6 lbs of MacBook, or even the 2ish of the eeePC when you consider that the n800 is [jacket] pocketable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
