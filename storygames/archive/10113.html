They can only end how we anticipated or in ways that we didn't anticipate. A wedding doesn't fail because the bride or groom doesn't commit to marriage, it merely ends differently from what we might have expected. The wedding happens - has happened - regardless of the couples inability to commit to one another. In this example, the wedding is the activity, commitment an action.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in Radiance, I define activity:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>An event that forms a scene in a story. Activities contain elements and aspects that are engaged with the activity. An activity differs from an action in two ways, characters perform actions, but are involved in activities, and a scene does not take the form of an action. For example, two lovers talking in a caf\xe9 is an activity; stirring sugar into a cup of coffee is an action performed by a person within that activity. A series of related activities makes a story.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, many roleplaying games are action focused rather than activity focused. We tend to play a lot of games with rules that emphasize what the character is doing, rather than where their activity they are involved in is going. Pick up any roleplaying game at you FLGS and you're almost guaranteed to find rules to tell you how to deal with characters' actions in combat, but rarely will you find one with rules for where the combat might go. I blame it on our ridiculous love affair with Cartesian dualism, but that's probably an unworthy topic of discussion for story games. What I'd rather discuss is what you think would happen if games moved from being action focused to being activity focused? If you play any games that are activity focused, what kind of experiences have you had with them? Or maybe you think there's no difference between action and activity/                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224487/#Comment_224487" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T10:41:34+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 10:41AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MJ, since all activities (pretty much by definition) must be built out of a series of actions, where do you see the dividing line (or how would you go about recognizing it in play) between actions that are "X" enough (whatever X is) to be worth recognizing as something specific vs. just subsumed into the assumptions of the activity.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, two lovers talking in a cafe is an activity.

In the cafe example, the couple don't have to have an end goal in mind, they just have to be there. Or to use another example, if two characters are caught in an avalanche, there in an activity that requires no intent from them. In fact, the avalanche would still be happening (still be an activity) if no characters were there at all. When I think about activities, I like to ask myself where the characters at any given moment. This where isn't necessarily a physical location (although physical locations may matter for an activity, e.g. a couple can't be talking in a cafe without being at a cafe). When I think of an activity, location is more like this: "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">There</span> I was talking to my friend about the new CD I brought this morning." <br><br><br>Action: "My character attacks...."  (There is a subject with intent)<br>False Activity: "My character is in mid swing..." (This is simply a rewording of the above action and has just as much intent)<br>True Activity: "Ok, all of your characters are now brawling with some local tough guys..." (This is an activity because the characters are involved in the brawl at this moment regardless of any intentions they may have).<br><br>There's a little more to activities, and I'll explain below.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alan</cite>Is an action the means a player uses to influence the SIS while activity is what's happening in the SIS?</blockquote>\nI think that's a good way to understand it so long as "by happening in the SIS" you mean what it's about. When you say this scene is "about two lovers talking in a cafe", or "this scene is about some campers trying to survive an avalanche" you're in activity territory. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>I find this idea very intriguing, since it I think solves some of the question I had about the player having a string of bad rolls and it ruining the game.</blockquote>\nEven though an activity cannot fail, it doesn't mean that it has to end favourably for the characters or the players. In my example of the lovers talking in a cafe, they may want to stay together (and we might want the very same thing) but fate, some chance mistake, a misunderstanding, or some flaws in their personalities, conspire against everything that they (and us) want and they decide to go their separate ways.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224637/#Comment_224637" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T03:34:46+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  3:34AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2009 3:37AM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marcus: "some campers trying to survive an avalanche" sounds like it has intent.

It was a bad example. What I should have said is that the avalanche is an activity. If the campers were all unconscious or somewhere else, it would be an avalanche nonetheless. The campers within the activity of an avalanche may have intentions, and from those intentions actions, but the activity exists regardless of their intent. <br/><br/>Brawls don't have intentions. There are characters in the brawl who have intentions and perform actions according to those intentions, but there really is no goal or objective for the brawl itself, no way to measure its outcome in terms of success or failure.<br/><br/>I think understand why you prefer actions over activities (although I may be wrong). It's a cultural thing. We're raised to think of ourselves as minds that are separate from the world, but through some mystery process that uses intention, we act upon the world. We do the same with our characters when we roleplay. We create rule after rule of to figure out what our characters can do, but spend less time pondering rules for what are characters are involved in. <br/><br/>To quote the Professor Hubert Dreyfus:<br/><br/><i>A huge amount of our lives -- working, walking, talking, eating, driving, etc. -- is spent in this non-mediated coping mode and only a small part is spent in the deliberate, purposeful, subject/object mode. Yet the reflective is, of course, the mode we tend to notice, and so it has formed our common-sense concept of action and has been studied in detail by philosophers.</i><br/><br/>This doesn't mean your wrong to care more about what happens to characters than trees. I feel the same way. But I do think we can care about characters in ways that aren't focused on actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224978/#Comment_224978" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T03:27:25+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  3:27AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remain in skeptical mode, but it'd be awesome if you could give an example.

If you've ever roleplayed and not referred to the dice (or similar) to see how well your character is doing, than you're activity focused. <br/><br/>Action is a kind of disruption to narrative flow and it commonly occurs during activities such as combat. You can spend a long time narrating something, and as soon as there's a rule for performing an action in the activity, you break out of the activity focused mode of play and enter an action focused mode of play. Questions of can my character do that begin to arise. You may have spent the last ten minutes not worrying if your character can do something, but now he's in combat, suddenly you're supposed to pull him out of the narrative, treat as something distinct from the story, and roll the dice. The way in which your character becomes distinct from the story, or more accurately the setting of the story, can be illustrated with this question: when is the last time you saw someone roll dice to see if a piece of equipment could do something? We don't (or we rarely) roll the dice to see if equipment works, unless we want to see if the equipment thwarts the intentions of our characters. We just narrate the equipment doing - or not doing - what its supposed to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225006/#Comment_225006" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T06:30:23+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  6:30AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly.

It's not about the equipment (actually, I know a Swedish game where you roll to see if the equipment works, and that system totally sucks).<br/><br/>But, as I said, I'd be very interested in a game that works this way, where the story isn't about the characters. But I'm having a hard time imagining it. You have sparked some thoughts in me, though. You never know where that might lead. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>It's an interesting concept, to be sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225019/#Comment_225019" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T07:17:41+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  7:17AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2009 7:18AM by Charlie Gilb.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marcus,<br/>\n<br/>\nI also think this is interesting. One thing that I struggled with for a long time was the distinction between task and conflict resolution in the mechanics of different games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure if this is helpful or not, but would you say that actions and tasks are roughly equivalent? To me it seems that they are the same thing; they are both intentional, somewhat specific acts done by someone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about activities and conflicts? Do these map onto one another? One thing I can see is that when deciding the stakes of a conflict, you derive them from the participants' intentions, though the conflict in and of itself does not have a specific intent.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a direction you want to go? If not, just say so, or we can discuss it in a whisper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225519/#Comment_225519" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T15:34:31+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  3:34PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, I feel drawn to the same conclusion as you: the story is about the characters. But then I look at what characters are in rpgs and I see that we often have an equipmental relationship to our characters. We use our characters skills and abilities in order to achieve something not just for them, but for ourselves (maybe only for ourselves). We use our characters' strength to pull down a barricade, their diplomacy skill to charm the king, etc. It's almost as though characters become a box of tools as soon as we add the gaming to storytelling. Once we've reached that point, its hard to tell if we care about our characters because they're our personal set of tools for interacting with the fiction. And that we don't care so much about the equipment in the fiction because its too far removed from us (we rarely claim a privileged relationship to equipment in the fiction, unless its our characters equipment).<br/>\n<br/>\nCharlie, my intuition tells me that activities and conflicts do map onto one another. However, it may be a case that all conflicts are activities, but not all activities are conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226240/#Comment_226240" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T10:36:09+00:00" title="August 20, 2009 10:36AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Coming in kinda late, but maybe this will help:<br><br>The avalanche, as you describe it (i.e. irrespective of the characters) is something I'd call an "event," not an activity. If there were no characters there, it would still happen (dismissing trees-falling-in-woods metaphysical issues). If one character was suicidal and rode the wavefront to his or her doom while another desperately fought to stay on top of the snow, the event would still happen. And for the sake of semantics, there's no reason to think of an event as instantaneous or momentary (like an action would be).<br><br>You have action (task) well laid out--it's all IIEE. But I note, again, the time period distinction: very few actions can take place over extended periods of time--that strays into activity.<br><br>So what is activity, then, but a sort of holistic view of a series of actions? In spite of the Dreyfus quote, I don't think it is very common for people to "do an activity" with absolutely no intent. The intent might be autonomic or subconscious (breathing to stay alive); orthogonal to the activity (listening to music to relax); or incidental (trying to look particularly adept at a skill when just getting it done would suffice). And I think you're absolutely right when you say that "all conflicts are activities, but not all activities are conflicts;" though, from a gaming context, an activity that didn't serve to explore, advance, or resolve a pertinent conflict could be said to be kruft (e.g. the dreaded Shopping Trip before an adventure, where the only "conflict" is "do I pay a bad price"--there's no real room to utterly fail, because that undermines the actual point of play: adventuring with sufficient tools and resources to make it a challenge but not impossible).<br><br>Anyhow, the crux of my points are that you might want to consider events as separate from activities, because activities ultimately have intents while events "just happen" (i.e. have efficient and material causes but not final causes).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226933/#Comment_226933" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T12:04:59+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 12:04PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Activity, for me, connotates movement toward an ending, and an event, as I see it, is more of a moment time in which something is happening. Or to put it another way, activities are becoming, events are being.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn activity is something which can be engaged in: <i>a runner is engaged in running a marathon, his family watching from the sidelines</i>. An activity is something that is done so as to engage with the activity: <i>he runs with long deliberate strides</i>. The event itself is the marathon and it happens whether or not a third party engages with it or not, but it happens in a very different way for them than it does the runner and his family. Much like how Ramadan, is an event and an activity for Muslims, but only an event for me as I don't engage in Ramadan and wouldn't really understand the actions needed to engage in Ramadan even if I were to fast during the ninth month of the Islamic calender.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
