It's cover is made of gilded and jewel-encrusted dragonskin. Inside it's perfumed pages (made from the pulp of two dozen cypress trees not less than four hundred years old) you will find many spells of illusions both grand and subtle. But how will you read it? Only Quadraksals himself knows how to part those covers and reveal the contents of his jewelled heart!<br/><br/>The <i>Book of Lands</i> is an ancient tome. Though it contains but a few spells, it's magical pages put no limit on the number of simple words that can be written on them. This book has been passed down from generation to generation through a long line of sorcerous geomancers, all of whom recorded their investigations of stones and soils and the things that grow in them, in all the lands they ever travelled to. No greater store of geological knowledge exists!<br/><br/>The <i>Coiled Ropes of Gorgonas</i> is an unusual spellbook. It was composed in the ancient language of Khorhaq Ttal, which is much like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham" rel="nofollow">Ogham</a>, except that it is not inscribed on stone, but written with knots in rope and string, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu" rel="nofollow">Quipus</a>. This "book" is thus a thick collection of knotted cords. Its current owner, Gorgonas, has saturated these cords in paralytic poison, which he has developed an immunity to, and he uses them as garottes when needs must. Beware their poison! For it has twisted the features of Dread Gorgonas to such a degree that he now wears a hideous mask to hide his mangled features.<br/><br/>But the Elf Queen has by far the strangest spellbook. The Quickling is a small fox-like creature, about the size of a squirrel, that sits upon her shoulders and whispers its spells into her ear.<br/><br/>Your turn!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374895/#Comment_374895" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-28T23:14:53+00:00" title="April 28, 2012 11:14PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Turing's Staff of the Enigma is a two yard long ebony staff.

The spells themselves often contain simple errors that can be caught and fixed by even intermediate students.

Erasing the parasite is hard because it will hide seeds of invisible ink inside other spell texts and if erased it will simply start growing from one such seed engulfing the victim spell from within. It seems to prefer summoning spells and hate the taste of scrying and detection spells which it will reluctantly eat in a time of starvation.

Of course, many of the minor nobles or their families were able to escape into hiding, not being primary targets of the Greenfelter uprising.  Denton's family, but not Denton himself, fled into the mountain passes east of their holdings, trying to make their way to the family summer house, while Denton defended their home.  It was not summer, and the cold of the pass meant the death of each of them in turn. This particular tapestry was among the possessions the family hurriedly gathered, and with good reason; the tapestry was the repository of Denton's magical learning, over his 190 year life. Beyond this, no one remembers much of what Denton himself was like. <br/><br/>The tapestry is a rich purple thing, made of fine, but not unobtainable threads.  It is stitched through with yellow threads, that at first appear to be gold, but upon inspection can be found to be made of simple cotton, glinting with their magical power. Viewing the tapestry is a bit unnerving, and the longer it is viewed the more difficult it is to focus on the tapestry as a whole.  The yellow threads seem to move on their own, when in your peripheral vision, but are unmoving when confronted directly.  The threads do not change location, but if you can examine one section of the tapestry at a time, and pay attention to the moving, shimmering threads 'just' out of direct sight, it is possible to learn Denton's spellcraft.  The longer one stares and the more intense the focus, the more powerful the spell that can be learned, but the more like Denton one's mind must become, as it was his very personal art that made the tapestry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375017/#Comment_375017" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T01:43:46+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  1:43AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 1:44AM by elkin.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>THE COMPANDERIA, being a most thorough list of Shortcuts and Byways contrived and trodden by Sir Alexander Hymn and his many acolytes in the course of their many excursions into the Unknown, compiled by his pious sons to the benefit of wizards and laymen alike</i> is a musty old leather-bound tome, written in a very dry language with no hint of literary talent.

The book resists any form of marking placed on the outside by the user and actively changes appearance in order to increase the likelyhood that it changes hands often.<br/><br/>On the right side of each page appears text written in a consistant, easily read hand (in fact, the entire book can be ready by anyone with fluency in any language) and consists of descriptions of elaborate rituals, all of which involve the sacrifice of innocence, forcing change upon others, the theft of beloved objects, and other forms of corruption. Mixed with the descriptions is praise for past ritual performances and advice for improvement of results.<br/><br/>On the left hand pages are descriptions of previous rituals being used, including exacting details of the acquisition of ritual components, the pain caused to others in the process, and how the ritualist feels about what they have done. These exacting descriptions are followed by humble requests regarding the outcomes of future rituals, which are then responded to in the facing right-hand pages. The left hand pages are written in several scripts and some of the entries have been annotated in the scripts of those writing later pages.

The high-quality vellum pages are inscribed with many colours of ink. The tome's original author pseudo-Prismaticus ingeniously managed to pack a great many spells into this slim collection by layering them. In each chapter, the elements in black ink are common to all spells, while certain colours (orange, green, blue) are common to only some spells, and other colours (blue, red, yellow) are unique to one specific spell.<br/><br/>Chapter 1 contains Colour Spray, Hypnotism, Conjure Bread (actually steals nearby bread, doesn't create it), and Minor Illusion, but if the blue elements on each left-hand page are left out, or the blue elements on each right-hand page are included, the caster will set off a Fire Trap and be burned.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 contains Far Seeing, Prismatic Shield, and Cure Poison, but the colour codes for the instructions and the visualization elements are different.<br/><br/>Chapter 3 contains Dimension Door, Iridescent Fog, and Fly, but if the black elements that are identical to the green elements are not removed, the spell cast will be Polymorph Self, and the caster will become a frog.<br/><br/>Chapter 4 contains Wizard Lock, Hands of Fire, and Invisibility, and is not trapped at all, but each spell requires translating the common instructions into a different language.<br/><br/>It is not known why pseudo-Prismaticus used similar elements in these particular spells or why he thought they should be associated with each other but I seem to recall there was a graduate student at one of the more heterodox Northern universities working on a thesis based on notes copied from the codex. There might even be an intact copy of the full text floating around, although copies of individual chapters, though still rare, are much more common.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375307/#Comment_375307" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T16:28:38+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  4:28PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://timecube.com/" rel="nofollow">Time Cube</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375372/#Comment_375372" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T21:59:30+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  9:59PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 10:00PM by Mathalus.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Morgan Stinson Social Studies Mr. Bentley 3rd Period</span><br/><br/>I have a spellbook that I created during a number of difficult bus rides while I was going through puberty.

Issued by an anonymous publisher, whom we now know to Christian Osternagel of Danzig, in 1803. In this little known and enigmatic treatise, the philosopher Karmichael offers a Kantian account of secrets. He argues that secrets escape the conditions of sensible perception, and as such, they exist in a realm where ontological distinctions do not hold. He draws the conclusion that, if someone could attain an "intellectual intuition", a way of knowing that transcended the senses, for that person, all secrets would be one --- to know one secret would be to know all secrets. In addition to pure theory, the book contains several formulae and procedures for attaining the right state of enlightenment, many of which take the form of ritual invocations of Satan. The book is dedicated to an unknown patron referred to only as "Magus", and the dedication indicates that the Theory was supposed to be some sort of dissertation, submitted as a requirement for a rank of IV\xb0.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375395/#Comment_375395" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T01:14:58+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  1:14AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, I just submitted a dissertation on magic as a requirement for that same rank myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375397/#Comment_375397" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T02:43:58+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  2:43AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <i>Impactful Deck</i>, a mashup of investor relations powerpoint slides gleaned from hundreds of dead internet companies. <br/><br/>I don't know why this exists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375401/#Comment_375401" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T03:14:35+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  3:14AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 3:14AM by James_Mullen.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16408&amp;page=1#Item_21" rel="nofollow">[Make Stuff] Spellbook ideas!</a> is a discussion thread on an obscure on-line forum purporting to be for the purpose of talking about 'story games' (whatever they are).

Ratidex was a master and pioneer of speech altering spells inventing spells such as universal translation, lie detection, altered understanding (offensive cryptography), magical megaphone, thoughtcasting, writing between the lines, subliminal inception, infectous echoes and babble bubbling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375601/#Comment_375601" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T14:47:12+00:00" title="May  1, 2012  2:47PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 1, 2012 2:50PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnzo, what kind of spells does the <i>Impactful Deck</i> have in it?

Mad scrawlings adorn the walls, papers are strewn everywhere and various body parts and other indescribable things in jars are scattered here and there. The various notes, books and images, if collected, amount to a Mythos Tome. It is a mixture of English and Arabic, translated via the intermediaries of an English-French and French-Arabic dictionaries. There are three full spells present in the text, Call Dark Servitor, Summon Ancester and Blessing of the Dark (enchant knife).

Bret, Alexander or Topi, if you're reading this, please skip this post.<br/><br/>The mechanics are Burning Wheel. The setting is heavily flavored by Artesia's Known World and my own fascination with/travels in northern Italy.<br/><br/><br/> Codex di Hurias Imparato con Annotazioni per Aspiranti al Sentiero Invisibile<br/>(The Book of Hurias the Learned, with Annotations for Aspirants to the Invisible Path)<br/><br/>The Codex di Hurias Imparato comes in a deep, richly lacquered box inlaid with an elaborate ivory triskelion\u2014the Daedeki Grammata Rune of Becoming\u2014set upon a sunburst. The box is in fact a cunningly designed puzzle box composed of a dozen sliding slats that must be moved in a precise order to allow the lid to be raised. <br/><br/>It requires an Ob 2 Strategy Games test to open the box. The user may opt to make an Ob 1 Meditation test to center himself before attempting the box. One who has successfully opened the box receives +1D Advantage to comprehending the contents.<br/><br/>Inside the box is a book, bound in fine Corsan leather and stamped with the Rune of Becoming, the Rune of Dreaming and the Rune of Glamours. Beneath the codex are four sets of hinged wooden slats. Each unfolds into a beautiful and somewhat disturbing heptaptych that depicts a figure, perhaps Hurias himself, in a different scene that seems drawn from the Arcana: The Magician, The Emperor, The Hermit and The Hanged Man.<br/><br/>Each heptaptych is in fact a different spell. The book is a primer on Hermetic Lore and Hermetic Ritual and a series of annotations on the heptaptychs intended to guide the reader in unlocking their secrets.<br/><br/>Reading the primer requires an Ob 3 Read test and takes 4 + (10 - Reader\u2019s Will) days. Success grants the reader an Ob 1 test toward Hermetic Lore or Hermetic Ritual. Successes over the obstacle may be spent to allow the reader to earn additional tests toward learning Hermetic Lore or Hermetic Ritual. Each test costs one success, and the reader must spend an additional 4 + (10 - Reader\u2019s Will) days studying the text per test. As always, successes over the obstacle may also be spent to reduce time as per the Quickly rules. The reader may test once for learning Hermetic Lore and once for learning Hermetic Ritual.<br/><br/>Heptaptych 1: The Magician. The center panel shows a majestic robed figure standing behind a brass cauldron. In his right hand he holds an ivory wand, and his left hand rests upon the hilt of a sword wrapped with a talisman bearing the Daedekine Ward Rune. His left finger appears to be pointing downward. Serpents are wrapped about both his wrists. He wears a golden crown of laurels, and from its center shines the Light of Understanding, illuminating the Daedekine Rune of Making. The surrounding panels seem to depict his journey from callow youth to master of the craft.<br/><br/>Deciphering this heptaptych requires an Ob 3 Symbology test linked to an Ob 2 Meditation test. Failure in the Symbology test increases the Obstacle of the Meditation test by one and doubles the amount of time it takes to learn the spell. Failure in the Meditation test means the spell takes weeks to learn rather than days.<br/><br/>Hurias della Corona di Comprensione (Hurias\u2019s Crown of Understanding), Ob 3 (Hermetic Lore). The magician weaves a crown of laurels (Ob 1 Weaving test) and performs the incantation and mystic gestures. Anyone who wears the crown may add +1D advantage to one Ancient Languages, Astrology, Aura Reading, Foreign Languages, Philosophy, Read or Symbology test. It takes an hour to perform this spell. Successes over the obstacle may be spent to perform the spell Quickly. The magic of the crown lasts until used, at which point it flares with heatless flame and burns to a fine, powdery ash.<br/><br/>Heptaptych 2: The Emperor. The center panel shows a crowned and armored man, draped in red and seated upon a throne of gold, which represents the Sun Throne of Sole. His crown is marked with the Daedekine Runes of Fire, Earth, Water and Air. Behind him is the mark of an Imperial Eagle. In his right hand he holds a scepter with a Riven Illumination Rune, and in his left hand he holds a globe of the world surmounted by a cross\u2014perhaps the Imperial Dominion Rune. The surrounding panels seem to depict his journey from master of the self to master of the world.<br/><br/>Deciphering this heptaptych requires an Ob 3 Symbology test linked to an Ob 3 Meditation test. Failure in the Symbology test increases the Obstacle of the Meditation test by one and, once the spell is successfully learned, increases the Obstacle of Bargaining with spirits summoned by the spell by 1. Failure in the Meditation test means the magician has learned a perverted version of the spell; it now summons a Rahabi, specifically a Gamezhiel (Timinit the Vermilion Dancer) that seeks to tempt the magician onto Ligrid\u2019s path.<br/><br/>Il Lure della Fiamme (The Lure of Flames), Ob 4 (Hermetic Ritual). After ritually preparing himself and the fire, the magician places a wooden disc inscribed with the Rune of Fire into the flames and begins an alternately sibilant and staccato chant to call an elemental forth. If its Name is used, a specific elemental appears. Otherwise, the magician must roughly specify the power of the elemental he seeks. Small elementals are the easiest to easiest to control, while very large elementals are exceedingly dangerous. While most elementals are not especially intelligent, they are willful beasts and do not take kindly to being shackled by a magician\u2019s power.<br/><br/>Heptaptych 3: The Hermit. The center panel depicts a cloaked and hooded man bearing a staff entwined with two serpents in his left hand and a lantern in his right. He is standing upon what appears to be a mountain peak, but rather than look out upon the vistas before him, his gaze is cast down upon his next step. Shadows gather around him, cast back only by the illumination of his lantern. The surrounding panels seem to depict his journey from a man surrounded by sycophants, followers and ill-intentioned guides to a seeker who chooses his own path.<br/><br/>Deciphering this heptaptych requires an Ob 4 Symbology test linked to an Ob 3 Meditation test. Failure in the Symbology test increases the Obstacle of the Meditation test by one and doubles the amount of time it takes to learn the spell.  Failure in the Meditation test means the spell has twisted something inside the magician\u2019s soul, causing people to forget his presence when he attempts to engage them. He is +1 Ob to all social skills until he receives an Ob 3 Hermetic Purification Ritual. Once freed of the curse, he may attempt to learn the spell again.<br/><br/>Hurias il Manto di Vigilanza (Hurias\u2019s Mantle of Watchfulness), Ob = vs. Victim\u2019s Perception (+1 for a Single Test against a Single Target; +2 for a Conflict against a Single Target; +3 for a Single Test against a Group; +4 for a Conflict against a Group), (Hermetic Lore). Wrapping himself with a black shawl while performing this incantation, the magician takes command of the perceptions of those around him and forces those who look upon him to simply ignore his presence. Those who witness the magician perform the spell see him vanish before their eyes. It takes 2 actions to perform this spell.<br/><br/>Heptaptych 4: The Hanged Man. The center panel depicts a man suspended from one foot by a rope from a crossbar, which rests upon two leafless trees. His free leg is crossed behind him. He wears white and red clothing (thought to be a sign of the White and Red Elixirs of the alchemists), and his hands appear to be tied behind his back. A golden halo glows around his head, and from his coin purse spills a shower of golden coins. The suspension of the figure is believed to show the separation of the Self from both the Earth and the Heavens, where one gains insights into the nature of the world and gets a glimpse of the inverted Otherworld. The two trees are symbolic of the ruin of the Earth from which the suspended man seeks solace. The surrounding panels seem to depict the man\u2019s journey from a seeker of truth to one who receives it.<br/><br/>Deciphering this heptaptych requires an Ob 3 Symbology test linked to an Ob 2 Meditation test. Failure in the Symbology test increases the Obstacle of the Meditation test by one and doubles the amount of time it takes to learn the spell. Failure in the Meditation test means the spell takes weeks to learn rather than days.<br/><br/>Respiro del Mondo dello Spirito, Ob = Advantage sought (Hermetic Ritual). The magician takes up position in the center of a sacred glen and dons a tippet marked with each of the Daedekine Runes. He takes up an ivory wand in his right hand and sword in his left and begins his incantation, slowly matching the cadence of his chant with the breath of the Otherworld.

It is a powerful one, however. Cut out a figure from one of the pages and cast the spell and it grows to life-size proportions, fully animated and three-dimensional, able and willing to follow your commands. If this paper golem is destroyed or the words animating it are taken back, it's page is returned to the encyclopedia, undamaged. Only fire can destroy a paper golem permanently, and there are a few ragged, burnt edges in the spine, showing this to be the truth.<br/><br/>There are rumours that another tome penned by Blacktongue contains a spell that allows a wizard to add another illustration to the encyclopedia. Even darker rumours hint that perhaps this spell does not add illustrations, but actual people to the encyclopedia, transmuting them into illustrations and imprisoning them for eternity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376873/#Comment_376873" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-06T22:17:19+00:00" title="May  6, 2012 10:17PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2012 10:17PM by Krippler.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Constantin the Chaotic's Unwilling Tome</b> is written in spindly letter with green and orange ink and bound with smooth human skin.

It is a must-read<br/>\nstatus symbol for the decadent and gleefully corrupt wizards of Scarabae that seek to thwart the Church.<br/>\nNelandra Kir was a beautiful mage alive during the Rise of States who was fascinated by spells that<br/>\ntransfixed or paralyzed their targets. It is said that her lush garden was decorated by many a rival who had<br/>\nbeen turned to marble sculpture and that her preferred way to dispatch particularly meddlesome foes was<br/>\nto torture them while under the effects of a paralysis spell.<br/>\nLore<br/>\nThe reader can automatically find one useful fact about the history of Scarabae\u2019s rebel wizards who<br/>\nopposed the Church in previous ages, by looking in the book. The reader can also find recipes for various<br/>\nparalytic poisons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore can be found here <a "="" class="bbcode_url"

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Deadra's Diary of Default Dueling Dweomer</b> is a pocket sized paper book with burn marks from fire and acid and stains of red, black and green blood. It smells faintly of tear gas and vomit. Deadra vowed to win 100 wizard duels in 100 days and she learned much on her way but was slain in her 13th duel. It contains detailed descriptions and sketchy illustrations of her first twelve duels as well as casual descriptions of some earlier duels and the lessons she took from them. Her condensed advice is: <i>Be quicker. When you have the upper hand sieze the advantage and if you are afraid you have already lost</i>. The Default Dweomer is illusionary decoys, various magic missiles, a shield of pure force and a crippling pain curse called Feast of the Thousand Boils and several exercises in quick casting for both the mouth and fingers plus a recipe for a courage potion in the back. Copies are widely circulated among young wizards eager for duels and most end up scarred similar to the original. Recently copies containing trapped spells have turned up but this has not decreased the popularity of the work in the slightest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379800/#Comment_379800" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T02:28:07+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  2:28AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Finger of the Titans is a huge monolithic slab, protruding from the ground and rumoured to have belonged to the titanic predecessors of humanity from a previous cycle of the world. It is covered in ancient runes and different schools of magic and the church of one major religion are built on it. The lower parts of the Finger go deep into underground caves.<br/>The complex runes describe spells rumoured to be based on a different paradigm of magic and able to break many of the existing limitations in magic theory. Unfortunately the spells are difficult to understand, span buildings belonging to different cabals or to the church of the Radiant Light, and keep squiggling and changing in time, according to barely understood factors. To make things more complex, when the glyphs are be copied, they will squiggle and change and become useless when moved more that a few hundred yards away from the original ground. The city built around the Finger is home to the theocracy and several wizard guilds. <br/><br/><br/>The Whispering Oaks of Quilinian can be found at the heart of the Elven motherland. What only the elves and few scholars know is that the forest of whispering oaks is a living spellbook. The warrior-mystics of Quilinian do not write down their spells, but they commune with the oaks in a meditative state and hear the whispering of the leaves, remembering and singing back the spells, if you know how to listen.  Different areas of the forest encode different spells, the most powerful ones being relegated to sacred hidden glades.  Once Quilinian was was a powerful nation and the forest was much larger and holding much more wisdom and secrets. No surprise the elves started a fierce bloody war once humans started turning the forest and their ancestral knowledge into tables, houses and stools.  <br/><br/><br/>In the land of the Scorching Sun, spells are nasty rebellious things that can only be contained and dominated by the energy of living beings. Sorcerers have a seraglio of slaves, known as 'the library', each slave a book holding an individual spell and carrying tattooed on his skin the glyphs to transfer it and activate it. Master sorcerers act as receptacles, binding with the books, opening up their energies and channeling controlled arcane energy from them. The most gifted 'books' can hold several spells, but they must always hold a strong grip on them, as books lack the gift to channel or dominate a spell once it breaks free. The specific method to bind and release the spells to each book change for every specific combination of book and master. Also books can show personalities that are related to the stored spells, or the total opposite, in order to keep the spells bound.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380627/#Comment_380627" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-03T14:38:13+00:00" title="June  3, 2012  2:38PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2012 2:39PM by Seth Drebitko.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Gutter Mages Codex</b> Knowledge of rote spells is controlled by the various guilds and other powerful organizations. A small gang has recently been moving into the crime scene. The gang has cobbled together a spell book on dirty rags composed completely of non harmful utility spells that they make clever use of. <br/><br/><b>Scroll of Meditative Might (or something cooler)</b> An ancient order of monks once scribed their arcane wisdom under their eyelids that its knowledge might burn into their subconscious with every blink. It is not known if the order still remains but a pair of cured stretched eyelids mounted in bronze rims reflect their arcane knowledge if a light is shown through one side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16408/make-stuff-spellbook-ideas" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16408/make-stuff-spellbook-ideas" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16408/make-stuff-spellbook-ideas/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16408%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16408%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
