A good friend of mine, a friendly and kind but somewhat naive fellow, was introducing me to his new girlfriend.<br/><br/>This led me to wonder:<br/><br/>Has anyone tried playing MLwM in a totally "serious", painfully-controversial setting?<br/><br/>The game is written and illustrated in a way that presents a sort of Romantic sensibility, like something somewhere in-between "Frankenstein" and "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame".<br/><br/>Could you play the game set in a POW camp in Vietnam, or in Auschwitz, or some other horrible time and place? Serial killers, rapists, gay persecution, race trials? Lieutenants directly under Hitler, or some other dictator?<br/><br/>I suppose the likelihood of the Minions taking out the Master might be a bit of a problem for a lot of these...<br/><br/>So, just curious: has anyone tried this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123272/#Comment_123272" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T07:40:38+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  7:40AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the game is leavened with fantasy precisely because the subject matter is so crushing to begin with.

It was horrifying, in the truest sense of the word.  I'm just not seeing what layering concentration camp color over the top of that would add.<br/><br/>I wrote a bleak game about awful things rooted in real history, but man, it's got some <i>escape valves.</i>  You have a lot of control, and that was a conscious choice.

I'm much more of a deep, meditative player; and the whole group kinda decided the setting lacked any real bite to get us to Feel It For Real. Might have just been the playgroup (a couple extra folks sat in), or what we're used to (Nordic minimalism), but it would have been a lot more engrossing and straight up fun for us if there was something grittier to sink our teeth into, especially a situation where we potentially redeem the master instead of just casting him off; how it was explained to me, saving the man's soul was "too emo" for the setting, or potentially the mechanics conflicted with the idea. It'd probably be remedied with some social contract discussion just as easily as a setting swap; but I've had a strange hack for the system in mind for a more "cyberpunk" setting, which I'm afraid might lose that safety-valve feel. For me and a couple of the other players, though, the safety valve often feels like a copout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123390/#Comment_123390" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T11:15:41+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 11:15AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of the half dozen or so games of MLwM that I have run have been serious, but they contained gothic horror elements like life-draining machines or evil sex magick. I don't think we ever played a humorous game. I always make the Master really cruel and evil so humor gets squelched pretty quickly.<br/><br/>I convinced my wife to run My Life with Mr. President, a U.S. political hack of MLwM. It went a bit over the top and a lot of the players mistook the very evil orders of the President as humor. Some of the situations were inherently funny in a dark way: my character (VPOTUS) being forced to have sex with (secretly gay) Bill Gates to get his financial support for the next election. I think, if my wife had handled the scenes a little more delicately, they could have portrayed desperation and vulnerability better than dark humor. I think she just escalated to blowjobs too quickly.<br/><br/>My most intense MLwM game was at GenCon 2006, played with a handful of female friends who lived in the area and one of the NC crew. It was all about sadomasochism, child molestation and exploitation, and rape with the anything-goes dials turned up to 11 and the veils and lines dials turned off (all explicitly by the players). It was scary, painful, disgusting, cathartic -- and I was never so glad to see a Master die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123394/#Comment_123394" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T11:18:52+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 11:18AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was more of what I was expecting.

So I decided to drop by, and add a few more words. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs Peter says, no drifting. Stuck nice and easy to the rules - and then kinda lifted the story out the setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all began with a game, where all the characters were the failed waxbrides of a madman (the Master ofcourse), trying to build the perfect wife. We had fun in the game, it was good and had some dire scenes, but it stayed sort of distanced: it wasn't "dangerous". After the game we discussed this, and quickly realized that the fantastic elements created a barrier.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo with the next game - with a wholly different group, I asked them, if they wanted up and close or if there were to be any fantastic elements, explaining them why I believed there was a difference. They agreed to do it without the fantastic elements. We created a late medieval village, a monastery and a vishop who desired the prettiest girl in town. He had his assistents to eliminate any competition, kidnap her beloved ones to torture information about her habits from them etc. We had some incredible emotional and brutal scenes. This time it really worked and katarsis were experienced when master were being beaten to death in the burning monastery.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was at Viking-Con (2006). After that I played at Fastaval (2007), again a new group, again I told them about fluff, and about fantastic elements, and how the game didn't have to be in some Central European village. So we created a Southamerican nation (Junta the boardgame anyone?), master were bend on conquering the neighboring state, and the minions were his top cabinet members. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis time we had yet another blast with game. The story was gruesome and tragic and were evocative - I still remember the retired CIA-agent plunging to his death with his hands locked around il Presidentes neck, in order to safe the poor homeless girl, with whom he was smitten. That was after the CIA-agent had rounded up all the all the homeless and send them to the frontier to clear the minefields, and as he closes the doors on the last truck, he stares into the little girls eyes, and just as wants to rescue her, the truck starts driving, taking her to the frontier. Or the Generalissimo (another minion), whose brother wanted to kill him in order to begin a new revolution, when the Generalissimo kills himself to save his brother from becomming the monster he himself was. We had so many great moments - and having master killed were again very satisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my conclusion is that, if you remove the fantastic elements and do try to be a bit brutal, then you can have emotional strong experiences - and I do hope to one day play the following Masters:<br/>\nMy Life with Fashion<br/>\nMy Life with Mom<br/>\nMy Life (in Junior High) with the Most Popular Girl in the Class<br/>\n<br/>\nand perhaps My Life with the Computer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n/ Morten Greis                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123403/#Comment_123403" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T11:27:40+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 11:27AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really cool, Morten - you took the game somewhere I don't think I'd ever take it.

Make sure the players agree the Master is hateful.<br/></li><li>If Master creation seems to be heading in a humorous direction, ask the players if that's what they want. If it is, you won't have a serious game, but c'est la vie.<br/></li><li>When making Minions, be sure that everyone is clear on why their Minion obeys the Master -- why are they codependent? What do they need that the Master has? What are they afraid of?<br/></li><li>During play, escalate slowly. Do not jump right into killing Minions' connections. <br/></li><li>Play the Master in an understatedly creepy way. Overdo it and it becomes a parody. Use the Intimacy mechanic to be creepy (touching can be very scary).<br/></li><li>Use symbology throughout the game. What is inside the Master's head leaks out into the Master's Desmesne. For example, our witchy Master was hideous on the inside but sapped children of their life essence so she could stay beautiful on the outside; her mansion was lovely at first sight but then you started noticing the tarnished lamps, the cracked floors, the cobwebs in the corner, and so on.<br/></li><li>Take cues from the players to figure out what creeps them out.

I use it as is, but tone the fantastic elements down, e.g. a churchsinger too embarrassed to sing in public, but equipped with the most beautiful voice (and he was send by master to cheer up the Masters love, when she was grieving the loss of her fiancee).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I can see, that Dray has some excellent pointers, as how to play the game. One of the most important tools for me, is to do it gradually. Start slowly with misions, that don't require too much, and then build up, and in the beginning allow the players to invest in minions, and then move on to threaten them (Master demands, that the Connection is send away; e.g. the cripple in the church had a Connection to a rat living in the cellars, and the Bishop ordered the character to set out mousetraps - this doesn't immediately kill the minion, but it sure does threaten it).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd always go for the bonus die, it is so wonderfully to see players trying to keep up, because Masters intimicy isn't much of anything but a perversion, and having players go for Sincerity sure does add something to the game. Keep in mind that you don't have to go for the biggest die all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123429/#Comment_123429" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T12:04:51+00:00" title="January 31, 2008 12:04PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys!
