You are some sort of minor criminal who needs to be made an example of. You will engage in a footrace with a bunch of other social deviants across a singularly uninspiring stretch of the Ontario countryside. The winner of the race will become my brand new Evil Apprentice; the losers will all be banished for life to the Yukon, where you will spend the rest of your desultory lives flirting with polar bears and such.<br/><br/>Before you lies the following vista: an open field of scrub, with a low picket fence about thirty yards to your north. Behind the fence are some wandering cattle. The goal of the first stage of the race will be to get across the cattlefield.<br/><br/>Each character begins with three points worth of each of the following resources: Extra Speed, Strategy and Raw Malice. If you want to play, here's what you do - whisper me a description of how many points from each of these funds you want to spend during the game's first stage, and then describe informally what you're going to do to get your sorry carcass across that field. <br/><br/>Examples: <br/><br/><i>- I expend one point of Extra Speed getting over the fence first, and one point of Raw Malice sabotaging the picket fence so that it will collapse under the next person to attempt to climb it, giving him/her splinters.</i><br/><br/><i>- I expend one point of Strategy establishing a remote connection via cellphone to my orbital death lasers, and set them to fry the first racer (aside from myself) who comes into physical contact with one of the cows.</i><br/><br/>Resource points, once spent, cannot be renewed. Apart from this, your only constraint is narrative consistency.<br/><br/>The race will consist of five stages, each one lasting 24 hours of forum time. At the end of each round, I'll decide on the basis of your contributions who's in first, second, etc. When it seems to me (based on a combination of considerations: narrative consistency, amusement potential, a crude sense of equity, and arbitrary whim) that the goals of two or more racers come into conflict, resolution will come about using the following rock/scissors/paper algorithm:<br/><br/><b>1 point Extra Speed beats 1 point Raw Malice / 1 point Raw Malice beats 1 point Strategy / 1 point Strategy beats 1 point Extra Speed / More points of any resource always beat fewer points from any resource.</b><br/><br/>Of course, you won't know who or what might be screwing with you during the course of each stage, since all moves at every stage of the game will be whispered. But that's part of the fun!<br/><br/>At the end of each stage, I'll post a full prose description of what happens to every character, who's ahead and who's behind, and a description of the next dreary vista of semi-rural landscape that you'll all have to drag yourselves across during the ensuing stage.<br/><br/>My watch says 7:15 Central Time, on the evening of Saturday, Jan 30th. The game will therefore end at 7:15 PM, Central Time on Thursday, February 4th. Any player who misses a turn can still try to win the race, but will be subjected to a gruesome personal misfortune along the way.<br/><br/>Ready.............GO!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254130/#Comment_254130" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T17:22:53+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  5:22PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw shucks - only one volunteer, in a whole day?<br/><br/>Oh well.
