                            I actually have no issue with someone labeling a game or play style “bad”. I do want them to explain exactly what they mean by that word, though, because all it communicates by itself is that it’s not to their taste. (That can be useful sometimes, if I know and trust the person’s taste, but isn’t that useful for me to figure whether I will like it myself.)                        </div>

The 1959 version (called "Never Say Die") had a decision point actually; you could decide to "retire" chips over three (just getting them right away); obv that means eating up your own dice buffer so that's not an obvious decision. Unless you do math ahead of time.<br/><br/>"Pass the pigs" has a similar math problem; I saw a paper where they had calculated out the optimal number to always go for / always stop at. The folk game "10000" similarly. By that measure, Zombie Dice is honestly a lot more nuanced since there is no "optimal number" because the dice have bag memory.<br/> </div>

I don't know what LCR is, but it seems to me that your "improvements" run counter to the qualities you identify. Doesn't "easy rules, no prestige" mean that you can turn your brain off? Which you cannot do if you have more agency -- suddenly there are decisions to ponder and you can look like an idiot...<br/><br/>So you'd need to qualify "bad" or "even better" and when you do, I suspect that most of the time a popular design will be revealed to be pretty darn good for its adherents. Truly improving on a popular design in every way is a tall order. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any examples for RPGs or even video games (though I'd expect there to be some on account of clearer writing and technological advances alone, respectively).                        </div>

                            Saying something is a "bad X" still presupposes something about what X is. As we can see from the thread, "game" can be used to mean nearly anything. It can even be nearly divorced from the concept of "decision making" wholesale.<br/><br/>Fortunately or unfortunately, game is often used as a shorthand for "activity" where the basic functions of gameplay are moving pieces, or following rules.

If I understand you correctly, yes—what's the difference?<br/><br/>There was also something else... I really wanted something out of its game <i>text</i>, out of the way it was <i>written</i>, that it didn't provide. I just had zero clue how to run it from reading it.

                            I think Lady Blackbird is a pretty cool game, but when I’ve run it I’ve also rewritten things a bit, and part of that is having some more “GM prep” and defined fictional positioning. I should probably post that somewhere! It’s a fun mod (which changes up some of the rules, as well).                        </div>
