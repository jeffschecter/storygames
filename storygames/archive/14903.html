We're all experienced story-gamers and traditional rpgs tend to bore us.<br/>2. We're looking for a fantasy game that allows for long term (10+ sessions) sandbox game-play. <br/>3. If possible we want to indulge in some D&amp;D tropes (character archetypes, adventuring party, some monster slaying, etc. )<br/>4. We want this to be fun but not feel like a silly romp. <br/>5. We want to do much more than simply dungeon crawl.    <br/>6. We want a GM in the mix but are looking for more of a facilitator as much as an author; we're each of us totally fine with generating story on our own and perpetuating character motivations and goals.  <br/>7. Setting creation will be a shared, ongoing exercise and we embrace the idea of situation or premise play to kick things off.<br/><b><br/>So, what's out there?</b>  Looking for anything that might scratch that itch of fantasy world sandbox play/exploration but something suitable for story-gamers.  An especially awesome hack for Red Box D&amp;D? Dungeon World drift? Old school rpg goals but with New School rules? Pathfinder by way of In a Wicked Age? Also, yes  I'm very aware of Burning Wheel (great game, love it).<br/><br/>Thanks, folks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338687/#Comment_338687" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T02:23:10+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  2:23AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2011 2:26AM by Hans_c-o.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously Denys, you are describing Burning Wheel to a T, more specifically, the <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads#Burning_THAC0" rel="nofollow">Burning THAC0</a> hack of it ("A compilation of rules, advice, monsters and magic that give your Burning Wheel game that old school D&amp;D feel").

Also, definitely has to be easy to operate on the flight, being as how most content will be generated in play.<br/><br/>So yeah, ignoring traditional designs that don't drive play procedurally, in this genre we have <i>Burning Wheel</i>, which was already mentioned, <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, <i>HeroQuest</i>, <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>, <i>Conspiracy of Shadows</i>, <i>In a Wicked Age</i> and <i>Trollbabe</i>. All of these feature open-ended adventure play, a GM with specified procedural and creative responsibilities and a dramatically "sticky" rules-system that cares about who and what your player character heroes are. I would also mention <i>Legends of Alyria</i> and <i>Mortal Coil</i> here just to give a sense for the nimbus - one of those steps out of my purview here by virtue of its dramatic procedures being too specific for perfect sandboxing, while the other is dropped for being unnecessarily perverse (in the technical sense, you Forge fans) with its resolution system.<br/><br/>Now, looking at my line-up here, Burning Wheel, TSoY and HQ stand up as the most generic and powerful of the lot - they're all grand fantasy adventure games perfectly capable of doing this thing, the oft compared "Big Three" of dramatic fantasy adventure. HQ is the fuzziest in procedure and creative agenda, so if you enjoy freedom to drift and a lightweight system in general, that's your ticket. BW is clearly the heaviest and most complex, while TSoY is middleweight and flexible, capable of scaling even in the midsts of a campaign from HQ-like simplicity to BW-like detail. Each of those systems have their own specific mechanical aesthetics and creative emphasis, too, so you'll probably do best by checking them out and deciding for yourself - TSoY is available for free in the Internet, BW you know and HQ... it's only for sale, I think? I'm probably remembering that they have an open license for creating spin-off products or something.<br/><br/>The second-stringers on my list are good to check out as well - they're only second-stringers here because they're a bit more specific in what they are about, and thus less suitable for sandboxing. Fine games all, especially In a Wicked Age, which might be my favourite among Vincent Baker designs. And Trollbabe, oh yes, just fantastic if you don't mind your sandbox not featuring an adventurer party and every character being half-troll, all-babe.<br/><br/>But yeah, my pick would be either one of those top three or OSR D&amp;D, depending on whether I actually wanted to do drama or challenge as the creative focus of play. OSR D&amp;D does a challengeful sandbox so well that I wouldn't see any reason to switch, or at least any game that would do it better (potentially Tunnels &amp; Trolls, but I'd argue that it's going to depend on play technique at that point). Between the drama games my own vote would obviously enough go to TSoY - I haven't been fiddling with it for years accidentally, it hits too many sweet spots for me in terms of mechanical aesthetics, balance of crunch vs. fluff and so on. In fact, I'm so biased on this matter that I won't try for a closer critique right now - Burning Wheel is absolutely a fantastic game, and HQ is simply formative for me as well as many others, so most of my reasons for going with TSoY over either of those would be just petty personal things like being annoyed by the huge choice matrix in the BW chargen or whatnot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338773/#Comment_338773" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T19:19:33+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  7:19PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the OSR D&amp;D category, <a href="http://www.autarch.co/" rel="nofollow">Adventurer Conqueror King</a> is designed to allow sandbox play to fulfill your criteria "whatever the PCs end up focusing on ends up getting created" by providing an economic structure that makes player ambitions &amp; the challenges of realizing them concrete: like if you want to focus on starting a thieves' guild, or building a stronghold, here's how many gold pieces you need to create that. <br/><br/>If everyone in your group is used to creating story on an authorial level as well as through their character's actions, then <a href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2011/07/20/campaign-economics-as-player-empowerment/" rel="nofollow">campaign economics as player empowerment</a> may be less important for you, but in my experience having some detailed, in-game mechanics for tracking what gold pieces get spent on &amp; all the different they can buy is a nice complement and grounding for the Dungeon World-style mechanics for complications and partial success I use for carousing in the White Sandbox.<br/><br/>In <a href="http://dig1000holes.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/of-adventurers-conquerors-and-kings/" rel="nofollow">this essay</a> Eppy talks about Adventurer Conqueror King being one (trad) way to answer the promise of D&amp;D, with his Swords w/o Master being the other (story-game).

What I think really recommends it to a more sandbox, exploration-type game are its Journey rules (the game devotes about the same amount of pages to rules for journeys as it does to rules for combat). I can't speak from experience yet, but based on my reading the rules should make for an intense and interesting experience of travel and the tribulations of the open road.<br/><br/>The down side, of course, is that you'd have to hack it a bit to use it with your own communally developed setting as opposed to using the Middle-earth setting. On the other hand, most D&amp;D-esque settings owe more than a passing debt to Middle-earth, so the need to hack may not be very extensive. Also, it doesn't look that difficult to tweak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338811/#Comment_338811" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T23:03:00+00:00" title="August 14, 2011 11:03PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Folks, thanks so much for feedback.<br/><br/>Eero, Tavis, Akooser, Thor -- you've been really helpful and led me to resources I may not have considered (among them Adventurer Conqueror King and The One Ring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338820/#Comment_338820" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T01:24:50+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  1:24AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're interested in magic (or things that look like magic), then Mortal Coil is certainly worth consideration.

Basically, I replaced the stats/skills thing with a Stat+Job=Skill grid, partially inspired by Leverage.<br/><br/>Yes, it's more of a "trad done light" approach, but I find that having interesting social skills (social skills work in combat, plus out) and a nice lightweight-but-just-crunchy-enough minis combat system scratches the tactical combat dungeon crawly itch without making me want to claw my eyes out from the D&amp;D level-treadmill AC+HP+Levels thing that I just can't handle anymore. (Sorry OSR, Pathfinder, etc. folks. No flaming intended. It just doesn't work for me these days.)<br/><br/>True, the characterization-on-the-sheet aspects aren't as strong as what you might find in other games (beliefs in BW, and things like that). But the framework is so lightweight that you can bolt on just about anything you like with almost no effort. I added a basic idea for relationships as Edges (though some of it is already present in SW anyway, like the Sidekick edge).<br/><br/>So basically, if you want to have "some" tactical combat on a battlemat, I highly recommend that type of approach, and I'll gladly send you all the stuff I thought through and wrote up if you're interested.<br/><br/>Also worth noting - SW is built on a tabletop minis game backbone. So it scales up to really big combats really well. Which I think is a great potential bonus for a game where the players are driving the scope. But, again, only if you want to play out tactical combats (in a relatively fast way).<br/><br/>If you want all your monster ass-whupin to be done with words and dice and no minis, then go with the other fine recommendations in this thread.<br/><br/>If you already know and like BW, it's probably perfect.

I was also thinking about using some token system to create a deck of facts and unresolved questions about them, to be used to drive the generative process.<br/><br/>If you are ok with having a GM, Donjon could be the answer. I also just looked at Awen, which looks very interesting.<br/><br/>I recently played <a href="http://games.transneptune.net/games/becoming-heroes/" rel="nofollow">Becomig Heroes</a> and it also looks very promising for a GM-less hack as almost all the conflicts and adversities are generated by the characters themselves, and there are many quasi-gm powers that the players can already use.<br/><br/>Let me know if you find the right balance!<br/><br/>--i.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb" title="AusJeb"><img alt="AusJeb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AusJeb">AusJeb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339339/#Comment_339339" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T19:47:17+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  7:47PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Legends of Anglerre offers a Fate-based toolkit that can be used for a sandbox game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339341/#Comment_339341" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T19:59:22+00:00" title="August 17, 2011  7:59PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Denys,<br/>Seems to me like if you take your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231-7&amp;Mode=like">#1-7</a> as a plan into play, there are a huge number of games wherein you could do it.  <i>Primetime Adventures</i> certainly wouldn't stop you.

It's currently in playtest format though and not a final product.<br/><br/>It's a rules light adventure game with some story-game elements.<br/><br/>It features:<br/><br/>-Completely open-ended class system where you play whatever concept you desire.  Your class is a phrase or sentence that you or the group comes up with.  It drives what your character is skilled at and what his competencies are.<br/><br/>-Free-form magic system which allows you to cast whatever spells fit your concept.  You want to play a Pyro-mancer throwing down huge swathes of fire across scores of foes?  Awesome.  You want to call down the stars and smash the demon prince's kingdom?  Go ahead.<br/><br/>-The miscast system is fun as hell.  You have a small chance to miscast as a Mage/Priest/Magic User in which case you draw a piece of paper from the miscast bowl at the center of the table.  The miscast bowl is filled with miscasts that are created by your group prior to play.  <br/><br/>In playtesting the miscast system my favorites so far have been "all the 1st born children dying in the nearest town" and "You summon a Hound of Xaxel from the Dark Plane".  Xaxel did not yet exist and so we had to invent/world-build on the fly.  "Who's Xaxel, what's the Dark Plane?"<br/><br/>-Player authored priorities in the form of two traits which describe what you are running from/leaving behind and what/where you are headed.  <br/><br/>GM section is very light at the moment but the advice is for the GM to use these flags to prep the session.  In a sandbox game (I've run one with this system), the GM would prep setting material and NPCs to challenge/address these flags.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339552/#Comment_339552" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T16:46:52+00:00" title="August 18, 2011  4:46PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>SWM as it was the last time I played it is not really a 'sandbox' as I understand that word; it's heavily player-driven and relies on constant in-play setting creation as opposed to the broad-based setting preparation that sandboxing is based on.</blockquote>\nThat actually works fine then.

It's not a system in the sense that storygamers expect, where following these clearly-laid-out procedures from a single source will deliver a focused experience. Nor is it a big book of fluff and setting in the way that trad gamers expect, where the story is already plotted and made palatable in a wine cooler dilution. These old materials had no pagecount for anything but the bare bones, 200 proof ethanol necessary to fuel action at the table; the implications are as bracing, unadorned, and mind-expanding as a beaker of Everclear.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the things you can learn is that having a big map with gameable implications (how many hexes do you move in a day, what's the chance of a random encounter on the way) allows sandbox play to proceed in an organic way that's neither player-created nor GM-created and feels like discovering an independent reality. And the Wilderlands maps &amp; associated materials are a hella cool example of that kind of non-system support for sandboxing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339608/#Comment_339608" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-19T04:15:27+00:00" title="August 19, 2011  4:15AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, what Tavis said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341037/#Comment_341037" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-31T07:03:28+00:00" title="August 31, 2011  7:03AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Denys">@Denys</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/deathofthevele/rules" rel="nofollow">Death of the Vele</a> is a collaborative game that might fit what you're looking for.

For example, the Cleric just flat out names their deity, describes there domains and petitions, and that's a Real Thing in the world. A lot of the classes have areas like that. The GM is also expressly told to ask the players questions (about their past, the world, how things work, etc.) and use the answers.<br/><br/>I ran a short con game where, during setup, we found out that the cleric's god didn't actually exist (it was a con pulled off by the rest of the party on this poor woodsman).
