It's a tricky line of thinking but interesting. I'll start.<br/><br/>* One guy buys the vast majority, or all of, the games. That one guy -- almost always a guy -- is also singularly responsible for pitching new ideas, learning the rules, teaching the rules, reading the background, and generally digesting the material. Consequently he's also the one singularly responsible for synthesizing all that, making it his own, and presenting it back to the players.<br/><br/>* When there are disagreements between players, the GM arbitrates the disagreement and hopefully gives each aggrieved party something.<br/><br/>* When a player disagrees with the GM (who is by trad definition not a player), the disagreement is tabled until after the session. Period. But also, there's a guarantee that the disagreement WILL be discussed. Given the GM's role as continuity enforcer -- see below -- this may also include documenting house rules so everyone would know how the physics rules of the game had been changed.<br/><br/>(Side note: I claim this only as my own tradition of trad play -- I've been in groups where there is no player-GM disagreement, ever, by definition of the GM's absolute authority).<br/><br/>* The players are solely responsible for everything their characters do, and largely responsible for what they think. The GM can also kibbutz and suggest thoughts and feelings, but really it's on the players to act on that or not. They also agree to share that stuff, to think out loud, to verbalize internal monologues. Players also agree to plan with the GM present, with the (unspoken, tacit) assumption the GM will grab the best ideas and make them true within the game. This means the players often "plan toward" the GM. "Pitch" is probably a better verb here. But it's all indirect and passive and deferential to the GM's vision (see next).<br/><br/>* The GM keeps track of continuity and is responsible for tying up loose ends. This also includes ensuring screen time goes to the players who want it, and identifying those players who do not want it. Just good entertaining/emceeing skills, really.<br/><br/>* The entire roleplay experience is presented, by the GM, in as "you are there" mode as possible. We'd take explicit breaks for OOC talk, even including gestures to indicate "this is the player saying this". Other than that, once you're strapped into the driver's seat you're expected to stay there. For the GM, this aesthetic extended to providing secret information/notes to select players, sidebar 1 on 1 sessions, blindfolding "blinded" characters' players, etc.<br/><br/>So what are <i>your</i> traditions of traditional play?<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265826/#Comment_265826" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T16:02:23+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  4:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are all familiar to me, except the last one - I think that IC/OOC wasn't really that big a deal in my pre-Forge trad gaming; that sort of thing would've felt like unnecessary attention to detail that has nothing to do with the game itself. We did do information control, interestingly enough: many a session was spent sitting outside the playing room, waiting for the GM to get a solo bit sorted out with some other player. This wasn't even in the interests of player vs. player play, it was just something we did to enhance the atmosphere by asymmetric information flow.<br/><br/>Speaking more generally, "the tradition" in Finnish roleplaying is quite handily defined by the set of games that were published in Finnish around the beginning of the '90s: red box D&amp;D, Runequest, CoC, Stormbringer, Cyberpunk 2020, Paranoia, Traveller 2300, Twilight 2000, MERP and probably a couple of others that I don't remember off-hand. Most Finnish roleplayers have these games in their past, so they were very influential in defining the shared common understanding - tradition - of what a roleplaying game is like. Without large cities and a surplus of players a GM-dominated play culture was a pretty obvious thing, which means that auteurism is a big deal in Finland: the tradition allows you to do all sorts of things as long as the GM is in charge and the players are relatively passive audience to the contents of play. Obviously enough the tradition that develops in those circumstances is highly literate and ambitious, but unable to really make things happen in play - the GM has an elaborate setting and plot, often challenging genre conventions, but there's not much electricity in the proceedings of play due to how emasculated and careful the players are in participating.<br/><br/>For me personally the killer in traditional gaming was the fact that the GM is responsible for the success of play and the high artistic quality of the endeavour. My teenage years were marked by a very definite striving for more powerful performance of roleplaying, which was understood in terms of more robust fiction, more complex fiction, more immersive fiction, more continuous and stable campaign - and the GM was largely the responsible for providing these matters by his technique and choice of rules and setting. This was exhausting when your co-players weren't as committed as you were, and impossible when playing with new people who didn't share the same exact history of assumptions in terms of mechanical procedures and correct ways to play. Obviously enough in hindsight deconstruction was exactly what I needed: reading the Forge and Ron's <i>System Does Matter</i> provided me with the tools to really look critically at the creative agenda of my activity, what I was actually doing. Stripping away false and harmful assumptions embedded in the traditional wisdom then enabled me to transform my skills and my play into something that is actually fun and sustainable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265829/#Comment_265829" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T16:27:41+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  4:27PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * The GM doesn't just run the game, they <i>host</i> the game.

With the people I play with today, that's not as big a deal; players buy the book or not depending on whether they think it'll be worth it for them, without that added social pressure.<br/><br/>Along the same lines as Ron Hammack's comment, our group doesn't require the GM to host the game, but it does require the host to be the person who invites everyone to the game.  The GM can't, for example, send out an e-mail that says "Hey everyone, let's play this Saturday at Larry's house" unless Larry has already said "Saturday's good for me, I can host the game if you guys want."  Likewise, you don't invite other people to come along with you without at the very least informing the host and the GM in advance (and it's better if you let everyone else in the group know, too).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265843/#Comment_265843" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T17:25:55+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  5:25PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>The players are solely responsible for everything their characters do, and largely responsible for what they think.</blockquote>\nWell...I donno. I see what you're onto here. Maybe this is as close as we can get to the bullseye. But the responsibility described in most early RPGs is for players to receive the fictional input (from wherever), put themselves in the character's shoes, and report back what the character would do. Good play was often defined not in terms of enjoyment at the table, but in terms of <i>fidelity to the character</i> even at the expense of enjoyment. My Guy syndrome is really encoded into a lot of how-to-roleplay texts from that period. In fact, the procedure the player is supposed to follow subverts their responsibility quite a bit, or at least obfuscated it. At least in my group, it was bad form to blame the thief's player for deciding his character stole from you.<br/><br/>I agree the IC/OOC divide varied sharply. Actually advice about it varied sharply too. Remember Star Wars d6's scripts you read at the start of each adventure? Yeah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265849/#Comment_265849" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T17:44:28+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  5:44PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting points, JD. <br/><br/>I was going to contend that some of what you've said in your last post <i>wasn't</i> traditional, and discuss some things as counter examples I've heard about very early D&amp;D campaigns run by Gygax, Arneson and their immediate inner circle.<br/><br/>And then, I realized I was wrong. Because by the time that there's a "tradition" to point to, gaming has already moved significantly away from the initial style of play of the creators of the hobby at the time of its creation (including by them apparently). And it is that tradition that is making its way into game textys and reinforcing itself among later adopters.<br/><br/>To be less obscure, the change in the real world social environment in which the games are being played causes a feedback loop that encourages several forms of play that are different from the initial play.<br/><br/>IIUC, the initial social context (at the time of creation of D&amp;D) is one of a largish pool of players getting together to play in the game of a referee-like DM on an erratic basis. The composition and size of any night's play group may be significantly different from the one before or after. The only really consistent group member is the DM. Players and their associated characters may be making all sorts of alliances and enemies of other players+characters.<br/><br/>By the time "tradition" has become establsihed, it's getting to be more the norm to have a small, constant group of players meeting regularly and playing the same characters with the same DM.<br/><br/>It's a difference between gaming club play with whoever shows up (interestingly, this style seems to hae been ressurected with modern online games like WoW) and gaming with a small group of pals. It's the second formulation which beomes in a feedback loop with tradition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265856/#Comment_265856" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T18:35:59+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  6:35PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that always jumped out at me (aside from the things mentioned above, in particular the whole "GM = auteur" image) was the lack of communication outside of the terms of the game and its fiction.

GURPS was enormously influential for us in the early days; we had started with Moldvay D&amp;D and AD&amp;D, but moved on because we regarded those as childish and limited.  With its detailed character creation system, focus on 'realism,' and huge number of expansions, GURPS felt very grown-up to us.<br/><br/>Our traditions:<br/><br/>1. Spheres of authority were inviolable.  Players had absolute authority over their characters.  GMs had absolute authority over everything else.  "Mind control" plots, or anything else that impinged on PC sovereignty, were verboten.<br/><br/>2.  It was forbidden to kibbutz on scenes that didn't include your character.  When it's not your turn, you shut up.<br/><br/>3. The GM was the owner and author of the experience.  The GM got the possessive pronoun -- for instance,  "Joe is my gamemaster.  I play in his Marvel Super Heroes game."  <br/><br/>4.  True player mastery was walking the fine line between my-guyism and groupwrecking assholism.  <br/><br/>5. "Firewalling" knowledge between player and character, or between NPC and other-NPC, was an essential skill as well.  Its sneaky flipside was something I intentionally tried to practice: allow the authorial impulse to inform play of my characters such that I could direct the story in author mode from behind a veil of justifiable character knowledge.  Having a character-driven alibi for defense against IC/OOC violations allowed me to hustle towards the fun.  In theory.<br/><br/>6. All these rules applied to all roleplaying games.  The only thing that changed were the details of character creation and rolling to hit.  You only read the rules to understand what the differences were, and the differences didn't really matter.<br/><br/>7. Extended campaigns were seen as the highest achievement.  We had a few campaigns go for years and these were spoken of with great reverence.<br/><br/>8. Detail level = goodness level.  The guys who were rumored to play Chivalry and Sorcery at the university -- those guys were the supreme badass hardcore gamers of the galaxy.  For us mortals, a detailed, fine-grained skill list was essential, because swinging a shortsword was <i>obviously not the same</i> as swinging a halberd.  There was no higher art than accounting for every round of ammo in your gun and every ounce of encumbrance on your person and every neuron of knowledge and skill in your dude.  If you were super awesome, you used different character sheets for different modes of your character -- one sheet for evening entertainment mode, with your kevlar tuxedo and ceramic pistol, one sheet for when you were in full battle armor.  Games that did not feature hit location were childish and stupid.<br/><br/>The first edition of GURPS Vehicles completely beat the shit out of this idea for me.  Immediately post-Vehicles, d6 Star Wars and Castle Falkenstein became my go-to games.<br/><br/>9. Outright munchkinism, power gaming, and grandstanding through rules expertise were regarded as distasteful.  We were there to have a fun collaborative experience with no winner, as per the play advice in Moldvay. The power leveling effect of the points-buy character creation of the 80s and 90s was a great way of ensuring equitable contribution to the game.<br/><br/>10. Good characters were <i>built</i>, not rolled randomly, for Christ's sake, because our characters were works of individual expression, beauty, and sovereignty. <br/><br/>10a. Everyone had Impulsive and Overconfident.<br/><br/>11. Some players played the same character over and over again.  If you did this, you were a weak roleplayer and a target for scorn.<br/><br/>12. Gender-switching was weird.  Habitual gender-switchers were regarded with suspicion, although occasionally one of us Serious Learned Gentlemen would attempt it as an Experiment.   There was no such suspicion of GMs whose campaigns featured prominent female NPCs.<br/><br/>13. Railroading was the worst GM sin.  The truest roleplaying happened in what we would call 'sandbox mode' today.<br/><br/>(edit: GM mastery was exhibited by anti-railroading: presenting a seamless experience, rolling with the punches, appearing like you'd thought of everything -- a blend of preparation, illusionism, and improvisation.  I remember clearly this one game of that era -- maybe it was d6 Star Wars -- had a note in its GM section that said, if the players stump you, feel free to call a break so you can think about it away from a table.  And I was like, whoah, you can DO that?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265894/#Comment_265894" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T00:29:27+00:00" title="April  7, 2010 12:29AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><br/>13.

When I was growing up, the worst GM sin wasn't railroading, it was getting <i>caught</i> railroading. The <i>good</i> GMs used the "all roads lead to Rome" approach where once you'd made up a dungeon, that's where the PCs would end up, no matter where they went. If they decided to travel from the Burning Desert to the Frozen Wastes, a <i>good</i> GM would absolutely let them, they'd just turn the sandstone pyramid into an ice pyramid and the mummies into undead yetis.<br/><br/>Sandbox play, though, just didn't seem right. As a DM in the 80s/90s, if I looked at a sandbox-style module, my first instinct would be "this sucks, there's no <i>story</i>."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265896/#Comment_265896" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T00:43:48+00:00" title="April  7, 2010 12:43AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2010 1:04AM by ping.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>Games the did not feature hit location were childish and stupid.</blockquote>\nJohn, you're killing me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> In college, GURPS was the <b>one true way</b>.

Weird franken-characters with one-eye, one-arm, high-pain threshold, cooking, physics, oh, and the power to turn into a blue horse didn't seem very weird at the time. Rather, they were full of individual expression and imbued with personality by way of their weirdness.<br/><br/>As a result, it was expected that in games, your job was to showcase your "shtick" or weirdness whether it was turning into that blue horse or whatever your bizarre, special thing was - and there were some doozies. Seems rather messed up or I guess just juvenile, looking back on it now. I wonder whether it would've still been this bad if we were playing something other than GURPS.<br/><br/>I'll add: The GM was responsible for judging how we played by awarding points at the end of the game. No one complained of course, because we believed absolutely that the GM had the power and right to judge your play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265899/#Comment_265899" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T03:30:32+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  3:30AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't necessarily see a lot of difference between trad and story gaming in practice.

It came about because I was throwing ideas at him of how a game could be fun "on the spot"--i.e. run without prep. He became quite irked at this, and told me in no uncertain terms that a "prepared scenario" and "predefined characters" were the heartstones of an RPG, and a game that didn't have both of those was NOT an RPG, categorically. That preparation was what made it Roleplaying.<br/><br/>This was the same guy who I watched improvise an adventure night after night after night. And he wouldn't hide it, either: we were playing GURPS Traveller (and, yes, every character had Impulsive and Overconfident, and, if you were feeling really out there, maybe some kind of Enemy disadvantage, probably featuring the current villain species in the game). At the beginning of most sessions, he would pull out the random planet generation tables, take a few minutes to roll up a planet, and then come up with some amazing stuff based on those rolls. He was *really* good at it.<br/><br/>And yet he vehemently denied that Roleplaying was possible without a prepared scenario.

You want to go into another world and something prepared ahead of time has more of a feeling of a true existence.  A third-party published adventure even more so, in some ways.<br/><br/>It's very hard for me to identify set traditions because I gamed quite hard from roughly grade 5 through 8 and then stopped until my thirties.  So much of our behaviour in the first period was influenced by our age and gender.  And I was a total control freak.  For AD&amp;D I seriously forbade the players from owning anything other than the PHB and there was a huge scandal when one of the players bought the DMG.  Another player ratted him out and we had a big confrontation in his attic.  I suspended him for two weeks from the game!<br/><br/>Later, when I got back into it with 3.5, our group's playstyle was constantly evolving and depended a lot on the GM.  We had a long-running campaign setting which we went back to many times.  We all participated in the world-building and there was an ongoing discussion about IC vs OOC and many other issues that are now spoken about quite explicitly.

However, players who were interested would occasionally arrange to play a 1:1 or 2:1 game with the GM to pursue character specific goals.  Sometimes these led into mission-based games, sometimes they just took care of something the character was interested in.  Not all the players in the group (which was a collection of about 30 players with 5 or 6 GM's at a club) were interested in that sort of play -- those players just stuck to the missions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266004/#Comment_266004" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T16:04:11+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  4:04PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think mission-based play is absolutely an important structural element rooted in the foundations of the hobby.<br/><br/>I also think that some of the things I (and many others here on S-G, though obviously by no means everybody) associate with bad ol' trad gaming have their origins not in mission-based play but in the seams and cracks that start to appear when the norms and demands of that mission-based tradition start clashing with players' desires to experience more nuanced, novelistic, dramatic fiction.  Even keeping within the bounds of epic heroic fantasy, the team-based model simply doesn't reflect much of the way the literature actually works, and players became wise to this very early on.<br/><br/>That's why I agree with whoever said that around 1990 is really the crucial time for looking at the genesis of certain norms of "trad" gaming.  I'm 28, and started to buy my first gaming books (GURPS 3rd, then D&amp;D 2nd) around 1992 or so, when I was 10\u2014and both systems' GMing texts really suggested a lot of illusionism and fudging to make "the story" work, or just to avoid disappointing players whose characters would have gotten killed by the RAW.<br/><br/>What I think was going on with those games, and definitely with the rise of White Wolf throughout the 90's which I fortunately missed, was an attempt to use old tools to do a new thing\u2014non-party-based, non-mission-based play.  That's when you start to get, IME, secrets among different factions at the table, unclear social contracts on how much you're allowed to be mean to other players' characters, etc.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that I've had a few more positive experiences with 2nd Ed. D&amp;D, but all of them were when the group completely abandoned the notion of novelistic, "story"-based play, and simply reveled in the joy of slaughtering monsters and getting loot.  I still don't think 2nd Ed. is the best game for that\u20143E, 4E, and L&amp;L are all much better, simply because their math is more sound\u2014but it's really interesting to me, looking at it now, that I only *didn't* get burned by gaming with older, traditional systems when the GM essentially ignored the advice about "story" and just ran a dungeon-crawl.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266015/#Comment_266015" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T17:54:59+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  5:54PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "pitch" of the game is often chosen by a subset of the players. If the GM selected it to try to recruit players there will be significant modification before the game starts. <br/><br/>The players will drive the game in any artistic or story sense, while the GM will handle pacing, spotlight, and keeping the players happy. The game is essentially player centric, where if a player has a difficulty it is the GMs responsibility to adjust the game to remedy while not causing other problems for the rest of the players. The GM is also organizer or host, depending on the kind of event.<br/><br/>Most GM advice is bunk, it is obvious to anyone that a GM can make a campaign as much as he or she wants, but it is players that make it actually happen, so it is players who have the power in the GM-player relationship, which can sometimes turn borderline abusive.<br/><br/>Table talk is fine whether chatting or giving advice. Players can relax about the game relying on the GM to make sure stuff happens, although players will often be cued by out of game indications when they are being too relaxed. <br/><br/>One shots or campaigns occur, but campaigns are universally preferred because then the dreaded character creation is a single event while you still get to player your own character. Campaigns do not go on indefinitely, indeed the mark of a good GM is to keep a campaign going, the mark of a great GM is to end a campaign well (rather than suddenly because players have rebelled). If the campaign isn't fun any more, try to fix it. Barring that player rebellion is imminent and the campaign will end on its own. <br/><br/>Player filtering is difficult to do directly, so its safer to let people try things and self-select out. That means letting players show up or not when there is a game. This can sometimes cause a bit of grief. Of course this flexibility is never to be extended to the GM. Likewise if the players are enjoying the game, then the GM is assumed to be enjoying the game, regardless of the truth of the matter. Sometimes this causes spontaneous problems as the GM fixes what players don't see as broken or otherwise simply a decline in GM morale. <br/><br/>Prep varies considerably based on the system, the group, session plans, and the GM. Generally you don't advertise exactly how much prep went into something until after the fact, but afterward it becomes a (dubiously) valid topic for bragging in either case "I wrote up that entire dungeon" or "I ran that from three words on the back of a napkin". <br/><br/>In general systems get used differently all the time, hacking, drifting, and house rules are accepted and will happen even during play. Players generally just want a level of consistency from the GM + the game, given that they prefer things to "make sense" for the game and the group so this often makes them happy. Likewise bending and sometimes whole breaking of accepted rules will occur, this may generate some bad blood in the most severe situations, but generally will be overlooked unless someone else is being directly hurt in the process. <br/><br/>------<br/><br/>Now I consider that my tradition, where I did the big chunk of my GMing and some of my playing as I was learning these ropes. But I've seen numerous other traditions in different groups I've played with, some of which hit some of the things other people have mentioned here, some of which are at odds. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266016/#Comment_266016" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T18:00:18+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  6:00PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>That's why I agree with whoever said that around 1990 is really the crucial time for looking at the genesis of certain norms of "trad" gaming.</blockquote>\nJESUS CHRIST, I mean, didn't you read the first part of your own sentence before you wrote the end?!?

I've had some odd conversations with gamers 10-15 years older than me, people who may be part of the OSR for example.  What I saw as "traditional," they saw as new-school\u2014oWoD and the like.<br/><br/>Obviously, gaming didn't start in 1990\u2014but it is my distinct impression that most of the things I don't like really started to become hard-coded into rulebooks around then, even if some of those things had their start much earlier.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting gaming was some sort of utopia in the 70's and 80's, merely that it took until (very roughly) 1990 for game companies to start pumping out rulebooks for settings where team- and mission- based play were NOT the default.<br/><br/>Edited to add the NOT in the sentence above.

That word does not generally mean "original" or "oldest thing possible" - for a comparison, consider the different brands of Christianity, such as traditional Catholicism in comparison to protestant lineages that claim to follow original Church beliefs and practice from before the Catholic tradition took hold. So I don't think there's anything weird in saying that what is considered the dominant mainstream tradition of gaming today has its roots in the early '80s (Dragonlance, for instance) and had its most dominant phase in the early '90s, after which we started seeing all sorts of deconstructive protest as people found the limits inherent to trying to combine story with party-mission-challenge play.<br/><br/>It's the development of roleplaying we're talking about here; a historical phenomenon, not some sort of Platonic set of idealized roleplaying schools. What we have today in terms of rpg theory and design wouldn't make any sort of sense if our current around-30s generation, us who started playing during the '90s, didn't live through the experiences we had. Just like the older guys who made the '90s game texts and led their generation got their own start with the texts and attitudes of the first generation of hobbyists.<br/><br/>I think that even just looking at this humble discussion thread will make it pretty obvious that aside from fundamental features that have been present since the '70s, our generation really shares a great range of experiences in our early gaming. That's the tradition against which many of us have moved in our own gaming, simply because the tradition wasn't working for us. Perhaps it would have worked if I had different people to play with, different game texts, somebody to teach us what to do or one of many other things that make people react differently to the same phenomena - no way to know. What I do know is that the very features prominently listed in this thread are the ones that seem genuinely traditional in a historiographical sense: we did not have 50 independent designers from mid-'80s to mid-'90s just accidentally hitting on the same ideas of story-prep, GM-auteurism, character backstories, literary conceit, role-playing vs. roll-playing and supplement treadmills; rather, those 50 designers (number out of my ass, I'm sure somebody can count how many people were prominently involved) were working in intermittent communication, influenced by the same earlier game texts, going to the same conventions, selling to the same audience, and ultimately using the same language and sharing a viewpoint - if not a viewpoint on how to actually execute roleplaying, at least a viewpoint on how to write about it. That's what a tradition is, I think it would be strange to argue that these people were all designing in their closets and not taking influence from prior art and each other.<br/><br/>(That thing about separating textual practice from actual play is perhaps more understandable if I note that I'm not very convinced that traditional rpg texts reflect very well the real praxis of play among the people who wrote them. At this point the hobby already had a rich textual tradition backed by furious theoretical discourse on the pages of Dragon and other magazines. A sense of how rpg texts are written and how things are discussed existed, and it seems at least to me that people were faithfully, almost blindly following the conventions of what a roleplaying game text needs to look like. This is why we get the same GMing instructions in all games, the same focus on combat mechanics, the same xp rules and many other things always the same, to such an extent that people playing these games have developed the sense that "system doesn't matter" because it's always the same system in the games they play. But that's just texts, the people themselves have played in many varieties of ways all along. I've had some striking discussions about this very thing with some Finnish traditional designers who've confessed that they don't actually even use the rules-texts they write; they just write the sort of rules they imagine their target audience to expect from roleplaying games.)<br/><br/>I think that it's completely understandable if a middle-aged guy uses the term "trad gaming" to refer to early D&amp;D/AD&amp;D, say; that's the tradition he's familiar with. After reading some interesting OSR text critique and historical analysis (<a href="http://grognardia.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Grognardia</a>, say) I'm pretty convinced myself that interpreting the entire pre-millenial history of rpgs as a singular evolution is a simplification; many things were cast aside in mainstream design in the early '80s, things that made way for storytelling ideas and by their abandonment paved way for where we are today. So I'm not at all surprised if a person who had more D&amp;D in their background and in general has stayed away from story-oriented gaming through the '90s will have a different idea of what "traditional gaming" is - he's talking of a different tradition, the earlier one! Still, the fact that people can disagree about what makes traditional gaming because they have different experiences and don't talk of the historical developments in a clear manner doesn't prove that there does not exist a tradition - or several traditions, as the case may be.<br/><br/>Somebody really needs to write a history of roleplaying, it's starting to be about time for that. Some work that'd take a serious shot at tracing the evolution of ideas, where lineages of influence exist and where people have started building anew. Might be an educational alternative to the relentless progressivism (thinking that old art is necessarily outdated and worse than new) and ideologism (thinking that there are static, discrete types of roleplaying, among which some are better than others)  that seem to plague rpg discussions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266033/#Comment_266033" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T21:58:09+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  9:58PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Still, the fact that people can disagree about what makes traditional gaming because they have different experiences and don't talk of the historical developments in a clear manner doesn't prove that there does not exist a tradition - or several traditions, as the case may be.</blockquote>\nThen how in the hell does it help us to say "traditional" gaming, when Matt's tradition was a vile cesspit of anti-story-gaming horror and puppies being run over and mine was a happy story-based utopia of singing flowers and dancing unicorns?

Some people narrate one sort of experience, others narrate something else, then we have a bunch of game texts, and out of something like this an overall picture emerges, or it doesn't. I don't want to claim that recognizing historical traditions or attributing any solid properties to them is trivial; to the contrary, that's a core issue of scholarly history right there - how to form a synthesis objectively, so that we can get a handle on the data we have. History of culture can't exist, we can't actually understand it, if we can't formulate general narratives out of individual data points somehow. I see it possible to argue that we actually can't formulate meaningful statements about social forces; some historicians seem to think that things like a coherent artistic movement do not exist outside of manifestoes exactly because counter-examples exist. Does the Dutch school of painting exist? Does the existence of Dutch painters whose work doesn't resemble the Dutch school disprove the existence of the school? Does the fact that these paintings are commonly grouped together by experts according to the Dutch school hypothesis prove that the concept exists in modern parlance at least, even if it does not signify anything in relation to history?<br/><br/>These are difficult questions, I don't want to claim that my own understanding of cultural history (that is, how culture gets developed and transmitted through time) is in any way authoritative - it's not, I'm just a dilettantte. I can say, however, that my understanding does encompass the idea that you, Jason, might have experienced an atypical local microculture of roleplaying through the '90s, one that others do not recognize as typical of the time. The same goes for the rest of us, definitely: we're a biased sample here - I wrote earlier about how the Forge has been self-selecting for the last decade, networking among people who experienced the '90s game texts and game culture in a certain way. Of course people at this forum at this time will dominantly report similar features as their understanding of tradition, as they wouldn't be on this forum if they didn't have somewhat similar backgrounds that have led them to be here in the first place. I imagine that if we went to the Whitewolf forums and asked about experiences of the '90s, we would probably receive a somewhat different picture: presumably people excited about Whitewolf games (which have remained almost unchanged in many ways through almost 20 years) have consistently found the same things we decry here to work for them: either they've played the games in different ways to begin with, or they actually like the things we've listed here as features of roleplaying dominant in the time-frame when these game texts were consulted.<br/><br/>I don't know you or your play to any depth, so I don't want to offend you by going into any extensive speculation. To me it seems like your perspective on the recent history of roleplaying is different from that of mine in part because your local play culture obviously was much more sophisticated and effective in using the available game texts for story-focused gaming than mine was. The other part is that you don't perhaps have as much experience with the Forgite subculture as I do, and thus don't appreciate its achievements fully. (Totally speculating here, ignore that if it seems offensive.) A third part is likely that we're using the vague term "story" in slightly different ways, causing you to claim similarities where I see differences. (I'm referring to simulationism vs. narrativism here - I don't know, but it's possible that you're calling story-based simulationism "story gaming" and claiming a similarity, whereas I'd contrast it with formalistic narrativism and claim differences.) The combination of these factors would explain why you don't find the historical narrative I've described in these threads to be credible: you don't see the difficulties and estrangement caused by the ''90s mainstream play culture because you were successful in enjoying it, and you don't see the change since then because you haven't had the need to involve yourself as deeply in the new games and design that have come up since then.<br/><br/>It would be interesting to know the objective, absolute truth about how common different experiences of the '90s gaming culture are, but like most matters of cultural history, we don't really have any easy methods for researching the matter. Luckily the relative authority of different experience bases is not that important to us - an individual experience is valid whether exceptional or commonplace, I should think, and therefore the understanding shared here of "traditional gaming", meaning the dominant '90s mainstream mindset, is effective enough for the purposes of understanding where these people, myself included, are coming from: you don't have to agree with them about what individual game texts advocate or anything like that, but surely you can agree that they're reporting their experiences honestly? Their '90s were like that, even if yours was not.<br/><br/>As for the term itself, I don't really have any particular attachment to the word "traditional" here. I use it only as a matter of convenience due to how it's already well-known and understood among a wide cross-section of hobbyists. I could as well speak of "storytelling tradition", recalling the high middle point of the tradition by the name of the most popular rules set associated with it. Or I could say "'90s gaming". Regardless, I suspect that either of those terms, or some others I might think of, would be prone to cause confusion. Perhaps the best replacement for the term would be "mainstream gaming", which is also in heavy use and denotes essentially the same set of game texts and practices. No skin off my nose, either way.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is the political bias somebody mentioned a while back in one of these discussions: the terminology of "trad vs. proge" is biased because it only makes sense with a historical understanding that recognizes a monolithic tradition and a break made from it. I don't find that particularly problematic, these words wouldn't find use if the experiences behind them didn't have some validity. As long as we know what other people mean by the words they use, I can't get that bothered about the terms they choose. I don't personally find any use for many rpg discussion terminologies, such as "roll-playing vs. role-playing", but people with different backgrounds do, so let them by all means use them. I well might challenge the terminology now and then if I hanged out with such people, just like Jason is doing here, but it's all good: let them use those terms if I can't convince them that they're talking of a false distinction to begin with, it's not that serious in the grand scheme of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266048/#Comment_266048" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T00:00:19+00:00" title="April  8, 2010 12:00AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2010 1:27PM by johnzo.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>I think mission-based play is absolutely an important structural element rooted in the foundations of the hobby...what I think was going on with those games, and definitely with the rise of White Wolf throughout the 90's which I fortunately missed, was an attempt to use old tools to do a new thing\u2014non-party-based, non-mission-based play.

The situation really called for the differences. Sometimes I was playing just 1 player and 1 GM. Sometimes it was a large group. Sometimes we had table space, and sometimes we were completely free-forming it. Really the only thing that stands out is the Player/GM distinction. At some points the difference between free-roleplay with sticks in the forest and an RPG was that in the free-roleplay everyone contributed, and there was roughly the social contract that once someone introduced something you didn't negate it, you only built on it. An RPG was different in that the GM had veto power. The only power the players had was to boycott the game. <br/><br/>I agree with the sentiment that there was a notion that preparedness was holy, and I aspired to that, but in retrospect the games that were most fun were the ones I did off the cuff. I still do that now, and it still works best. I start with a situation and a vague idea of what might happen if the PCs don't get involved. Then I let the players go and shape the adventure from there. I read cues from the players to see what they think might be fun, and then throw in my own ideas. That's how I GMed way back when, and I still do it now.<br/><br/>I'll throw one thing out though: Character creation took way longer than actual play, and the biggest point of deliberation was choosing your name. Some players got around this by always playing a character with the same name, no matter how different they were.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266084/#Comment_266084" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T07:43:55+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  7:43AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>The combination of these factors would explain why you don't find the historical narrative I've described in these threads to be credible: you don't see the difficulties and estrangement caused by the ''90s mainstream play culture because you were successful in enjoying it, and you don't see the change since then because you haven't had the need to involve yourself as deeply in the new games and design that have come up since then.</blockquote>\nI'm all about recognizing the uniqueness of every game, but I don't pretend like uniqueness was invented in 2001 on the First Thoughts Forum, or rediscovered after being buried alive in 1991 when White Wolf got a girl to play a roleplaying game who wouldn't give Ron Edwards her number.  Yes, I'm thrilled at the techniques that have come out of games like Fiasco, Burning *, With Great Power, Universalis, and so on, but I was thrilled at the techniques that came out of Vampire, Torg, Amber, Over The Edge, Theatrix, Castle Falkenstein, Shattered Dreams, Wraith, Changeling, FUDGE, Deadlands, Feng Shui, Big Eyes, Small Mouth, Seventh Sea, and Brave New World.  Do I see differences between 90s games and todays games? Of course! But do I see just as many differences between FUDGE and Feng Shui? If I didn't, I'd be an idiot.  Any division of roleplaying games that puts Whispering Vault, Feng Shui, Murphy's World, Wraith: The Oblivion and Shattered Dreams into the same category is just a bad categorization.  It tells us more about the categorizer than it does about the games.

My interpretation is that there was a tangible weight behind the pre-determined setting and adventure, combined with the pre-agreed rules of the system.

There was a a real place, with a real opponent, that had real capabilities. And therefore beating them was a real accomplishment.<br/><br/>Fudging rolls, improvising encounters, GM slight-of-hand to adjust the difficulty of encounters or missions, and gaming the system all undermined these pillars that lent weight and importance to what we were doing. And were therefore unacceptable.

But JD, I take issue with your statement that lumping a whole bunch of games together that have significant textual differences is a bad categorization.

For me, anyway, but I'm obviously not alone in this.<br/><br/>ETA: It's certainly true that there are some games within the "Indie" or "Forgite" tradition that give a similar underlying play experience to one another.

Seems rather messed up or I guess just juvenile, looking back on it now. I wonder whether it would've still been this bad if we were playing something other than GURPS.</blockquote>\nI was in those same games.  The summer of '93, when we were playing GURPS two nights a week, was one of the most fun summers I remember from college or grad school.  And, to be honest, when I think back on that time period, I don't remember any of the SERIOUS ROLEPLAYING experiments we tried, although I know there were some - I remember the theater of the absurd with Bob&amp;Glinda and TOTAWM and the Maul and "Don't kill him, Jonquil!  *crunch* Ooops!" and the way Truax made up plots by looking at his box of miniatures and picking out ones he hadn't used in a while. <br/><br/>(And that was about the time that Fudge first came out, and there was a discussion somewhere -- I can't find it in the rules -- that the philosophy was that you could spend your time looking up rules, or you could spend your time roleplaying, and when there was a rule that nobody could remember, it was better for the GM to just make a judgment call, the player to roll dice, and to get on with the roleplaying.)<br/><br/>But we also weren't playing in a purely traditional mode either -- more than half of the regular players in that circle were GMs, and we all took turns running games.  The GM for each session had the job of judging roleplaying, and from session to session we never questioned that role, authority, or responsibility, but we rotated running sessions and plotlines in that shared world, which seems to me to be qualitatively different than "trad gaming."<br/><br/>One of the things I miss about that phase of my gaming life is the way we took the game seriously without taking it too seriously.  The game mattered, firewalling and playing in character mattered, but we weren't focused on SERIOUS ROLEPLAYING all the time.  It was perfectly fine to have an action-adventure session.  I'm not sure why I can't recreate that now -- I think it may be that gaming time is so precious that there's pressure to use it to its fullest, and so I go for SERIOUS ROLEPLAYING instead of beer &amp; pretzels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266182/#Comment_266182" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T15:16:25+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  3:16PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>If my experience with those games is that the underlying play experience was nearly always the same, or at least similar in certain (distasteful) ways, well, then that's true.

But somewhere in there someone has to acknowledge that the overwhelming number of gamers enjoyed a lot of the games that are getting a bad rap here.<br/><br/>Vampire (for example?) was a massive hit and produced an enormous amount of really fun, story-focused play. I'm not saying that your shitty experiences aren't shitty, and I'm not saying we have to tote up all the people who had fun with it and all the people who didn't and figure out who is right that way (although if we did, the "it is fun and story-based" side would TOTALLY win by one billion percent.)  But if we're going to talk to each other, let's talk about what we liked and didn't like. Some of it may be rooted in a game, and let's kick that game right in the bad stuff and carry around its good stuff with praise.  But let's not put games in front of our kicks that don't deserve them or praise them when they don't deserve it.<br/><br/>I also can't believe that 90s gaming is being heralded as the acme of "trad gaming" as if this were some kind of justification for the term instead of the prior 20 years being a two-decade-large red flag that maybe the term is nonsense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266191/#Comment_266191" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T15:49:48+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  3:49PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's because we're <i>old</i>, Jason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266199/#Comment_266199" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T16:59:07+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  4:59PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, it seems to me that there might not be any reasonable way to debate the existence of the tradition in a short term discussion like this.

It seems to me that the Golden Rule, whether by that name or just as an attitude, is one of the more visible individual signs of the traditional mind-set in roleplaying. I'd be interested in hearing whether you think that the games and gamers who applied the rule consistently to everything in roleplaying were just a scattering of independent cases rather than a consistently developing tradition, as I've been arguing. To me the incompatible assumption of complex, nuanced rules systems and a central GM right to ignore those systems at will is a very definitive feature of traditional design, whether for good or ill, and ignoring it to claim that every game is an unique snowflake seems like outright refusal to try to understand how people play and think about roleplaying.<br/><br/>As for games being different, I have not and would not argue that traditional games are all the same. What I would say is that they all share a range of important assumptions, some of which have been sketched by polling in this thread. Just like early game designs all assumed dungeon-crawling and challenge-based sandbox play, the next stage of development shared the assumption of GM-crafted plot, detailed player characters, Golden Rule and increasingly complex and varied mechanical systems. Even with these features in common there are wide vistas of potential difference between games, just like your list acknowledges - Amber and Feng Shui and GURPS and Vampire are indeed different from each other in many, many ways. This does not prevent them from also being associated in basic assumptions of what roleplaying is, what is good roleplaying and how you go about executing it. Some games might take some assumptions more to heart than others, but all of those designers knew to pay obeisance to these features that were recognized as modern, interesting rpg design at the time. <br/><br/>I agree with you in that it's ultimately useful to speak of individual games and experiences with them, Jason. But ignoring the similarities between games will break down any chance of comparing experiences or even understanding the experiences of others just the same as ignoring the differences will. To be able to speak of our experiences in roleplaying as anything but consumers of product, we must be able to talk about what works and what doesn't work for us in individual games. And if we are able to do that, then we're also able to draw comparisons between games, at which point we'll notice some things, such as the fact that for some people the basic play experience didn't seem to change significantly between games during the '90s because the underlying assumptions of game design and play at the time undermined any superficial mechanical or setting design the game might attempt. Forbidding us to give a name to this phenomenon and reference it in discussion threads seem unwarranted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266203/#Comment_266203" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T17:23:13+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  5:23PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>what is your understanding, where does the Golden Rule come from, when and where was it a dominant theory of roleplaying, and where has it been most vehemently criticized?</blockquote>\nThe Golden Rule, as I understand it, is:<br/><br/>"If something doesn't work for your group, change it so that it works for your group."<br/><br/>And it comes from an understanding of what the hobby fundamentally is - small groups of people who may have different preferences from the designer and often each other.<br/><br/>I don't think it was ever a "theory of roleplaying", I think it was based entirely on the realities of the small-group tabletop hobby.  For example, the Golden Rule definitely was NOT a feature of RPGA organized play or (in the 90s) massively multiplayer LARPs run by White Wolf and organizations it promoted.  It is NOT a feature of MUSH play.  Those games recognize that to try to accommodate the preferences of that many people would be a very bad idea and probably impossible.<br/><br/>The reality of the tabletop hobby is that mass produced texts will never, ever, cover the preferences of the target audience precisely, and that customization will definitely occur, will always occur, will inevitably occur, and that can either be vainly struggled against, or celebrated.  It was eventually written down because a lot of people (usually young men in my experience, but not always) <i>were</i> vainly struggling against it and not really grasping that a game designer 3000 miles away might not have a perfect psychic insight into the preferences of their group and might not have written the game just for them and their friends, and they might benefit from overtly changing things together.<br/><br/>I can't think of a single cogent criticism against the Golden Rule that has ever been advanced against it by any person in the history of ever.  I mean, I guess some people said it caused me to have brain damage, but Vampire said I was just a filthy roll-player and Gary Gygax said I was ruining AD&amp;D by not keeping proper time sheets, so pretty much I ignored them.  There were some strawmen that got knocked down, some cherrypicked quotes that were terrible, and a few rare games were truly awful at presenting it (or never really intended to present it in the first place, replacing it with the idea that the GM's view of what's best is the only view that counts and relying on people to change groups to find the GM that suited them best - sure, there were a few like that), but here's the deal. <br/><br/>Before anyone ever wrote the Golden Rule down, it was already true, and it is true in all games forever, today, right now. If something in a game doesn't work for your group, your group will have more fun if you change it so that it works for your group.  And something that promotes customization and diversity can never be responsible for homogeneity and dullness.  Only the diverse customizers can have that responsibility.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266210/#Comment_266210" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T18:09:06+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  6:09PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>"If something doesn't work for your group, change it so that it works for your group."<br/><br/>And it comes from an understanding of what the hobby fundamentally is - small groups of people who may have different preferences from the designer and often each other.</blockquote>\nI want a cross-stitch sampler of this that I can hang in my living room.

Who is absolving what of who? Absolution means that you've made some blunder or committed some wicked act, but that it's okay because you've been forgiven by someone empowered to forgive.  What I think you're saying is this: You get a new game. You play it, making a bunch of mistakes and you hate it.  So you change the game to fit what you already know and you like it, <i>and this is a bad thing.</i> And the game itself, by printing the Golden Rule (or maybe JDCorley, posting about it years later?) absolves you of your sin of changing the game to fit what you already know and enjoy. <br/><br/>There are so many problems with this train of logic I hardly know where to start.  But first and foremost, changing a game to something you like better and enjoying your leisure time pretendy games more is never, ever a bad thing.  Especially since you know you're changing it, right? Initially you made a mistake, you thought the game was saying roll d12s and it meant d10s, so you change it to something you know, which is d6s, and you like that better.  Or whatever.  And maybe the game would have been better with d12s, maybe LOTS better with d12s, and if only you'd stuck through the misery and toiled through the horror of playing with d10s you would have spotted your mistake and figured it out.  And that can be a good outcome! Some people like doing that. <br/><br/>Others would rather have fun now, instead of 10 sessions from now. And I don't think wanting to have fun when you sit down to play a game is a sin that needs forgiveness. And if it was a sin, I am wondering who it would be against. You seem to think it's against the designer, because the designer then forgives/absolves the filthy players who dared sully their perfect design, by printing a Golden Rule, magnanimous in their generosity.  That makes no sense.  If what you're saying is true and people aren't willing to get up a game's learning curve before aborting instead to play they already know they like, and that keeps them from learning new things, that's too bad, but it's their choice, harming no one but themselves, and that only insofar as they miss an opportunity to gain something new, not that they are impoverished or degraded in any way.  <br/><br/>Think of the opposite situation from the Golden Rule. The game which you've mistakenly messed up has in huge bold letters on every page, "DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF MY PERFECT GAME, SIGNED, MARK REIN BJORK HAGEN", but it is a perfect expression of everything the designer wanted with no room for misinterpretation or mistakes.  We play a session, we hate it, we see a simple fix for why we hate it, but we cannot use it. We play another session, we hate it more, we yearn only for that simple fix, we cannot use it.  Please let me take up a new hobby rather than play games like this, a more pleasant hobby like being poked with sharp sticks over and over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266219/#Comment_266219" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T19:18:07+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  7:18PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I can't think of a single cogent criticism against the Golden Rule that has ever been advanced against it by any person in the history of ever.</blockquote>\nIt seems to me like this Golden Rule absolves game designers of the responsibility to ship complete or coherent products.<br/><br/>In a community largely composed of people who take pride in game design, or who value good design, that's gonna be controversial.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's important to follow the golden rule, as likely no system is perfect, and tastes differ among play groups, but I certainly hate when some horrible rule comes up and the system gets justified by referring to rule zero.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266220/#Comment_266220" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T19:25:50+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  7:25PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The difference between "good Golden Rule" (and inevitable, as JD says) and "bad Golden Rule" (that damages brains and social relations) is whether you read it as<br/><br/>"If something doesn't work for you (as a group), change it until it does."<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"All these rules?

We each have our own narratives of what's what, all based on what we know or think we know.<br/><br/>For instance, you know what I would tell if somebody asked me to phrase the Golden Rule as it is intended in the tradition? Here:<br/><br/>"If you the GM don't like something in the game, ignore or change it until you do."<br/><br/>I do recognize that there are games that are more ambivalent in expressing this idea, but to me it is obvious that the "you" the Golden Rule is directed towards has always been the Gamemaster, not the group of players; and it has never been the group's direct benefit that is served, but rather the GM's personal vision of how the game should go. And all this is only made possible by the fundamental idea that a roleplaying game is something possessed by the GM and given for the benefit of the players. His is the responsibility, and thus his is the power as well.<br/><br/>The above understanding comes to me most personally from late '80s games that do not yet write the Golden Rule explicitly - I've listed the rpgs that were most common in Finland in the early '90s; what they all had in common was the idea that the GM is responsible for content while the players are essentially passive in experiencing the GM's scheme. Some games had some little verbiage of how this is to be accomplished; the most effective advice was that it is better for the GM to have an attitude of ownership, to be ready to cheat and lie and do whatever it takes to make the experience work. His job was to make the experience right, no matter the method. I experienced the schizophrenic Impossible Thing in full force through the '90s, trying to constitute my understanding of roleplaying on this basis; the practical effect for us was that while the GM's technique and skill grew more elaborate, the window of participation, of "good roleplaying" for the players grew smaller.<br/><br/>Later on, as I came to be more and more disillusioned by roleplaying as a method (even while I always appreciated it as an idea and accomplishment that seemed to work for others), I also read many game texts from the early and mid-'90s, and later from the late '90s. (I didn't play these a lot until around the millennium, just before the Forge came around.) As time wore on, we saw the game texts become more explicit about the idea that System Does Not Matter. I've been reading AD&amp;D material from that era lately (never got into the game before the third edition, really), and even those show the sign of the times: Ravenloft books and Planescape, which I've been enjoying as literature, are all very much predicated on the idea of the game table as a theater stage with the GM the main player of the piece. All procedural instructions and theory in most mid-'90s games I've read over the years is pretty explicit about the very ideas that we've been marking as the fruits of the tradition in this thread.<br/><br/>As can be seen, we see the same times and game texts differently, no doubt because we've sampled a different slice of experiences from those times. A single person can't hope to experience an entire cultural movement directly, so it's no wonder if individuals will report different details and different conclusions from their experiences. This does not have to mean that others are stupid for misinterpreting what they've experienced; the fact that you've experienced different things yourself doesn't need to be a reason to deny the experiences of others. Case in point: the tradition can be real, and it can have dysfunctional consequences for some people, without this fact pre-emptying your own game experience or making the games you like completely wretched. I for one have no problem with people liking Vampire, for instance; I couldn't play the game by the book myself, but the setting has a lot of interesting stuff, and I can totally see how the game can be drifted into all sorts of functional practices if you have the right people making the right application out of it. I wasn't that person myself in the past - now I probably could do it, thanks to my expanding knowledge base, but I won't tell you that it was Vampire that gave me the tools, because it wasn't.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>It's a different topic, but I should say that I don't see your version of the Golden Rule as unproblematic, either. Seems to me that this rule can only be either obvious or useless, depending on whether the gaming group is prepared to rip a game open and rework it. The choice to do so is very, very inherent to traditional gaming - games are seen as toolsets for the GM and the group in doing this thing they do, and less and less as games by themselves. Through the '90s the understanding in my circles was that the GM is essentially a game designer or even better than one, and he should feel himself competent to do whatever is necessary to change the piece of crap you get from the shop into a good game. For the latter part of the '90s we didn't even buy new games, the presumption was that the GM can mod something out of the old ones just fine if he feels like it.<br/><br/>That's quite a responsibility, and I have to say that I like my current Golden Ruleless gaming rather fine. I design games and I play games, but no longer do I need to do both at once. Even better, by discarding the idea that roleplaying is only about experiencing the fiction I've become able to enjoy the hobby on levels that were impossible for me when my only concern was transparent system that somehow provides perfect character spec while also being irrelevant and invisible during actual play. I have to say that both my own direction and the freeform one where you drop the pretense of rules altogether are quite logical in comparison with that environment.<br/><br/>That being said, though, I do agree with everybody saying that the "good" Golden Rule is perfectly reasonable as an attitude for a group wanting to do it - but my experience also agrees in that I've <i>never</i> seen a game group that would apply the Golden Rule as a group; it's always the GM who is the driving creative force in these games, so he's the one who decides how the rules will be used, when they will be ignored and so on. The real historical Golden Rule that I'm familiar with is that the GM decides everything, fuck the rulebook. Just look at how these games are designed! They all assume that the group needs rules strictly and specifically so that the GM can have some objective metric that'll allow him to refuse the players the super-powerful munchin characters they want. Every single mechanical rule in Vampire is concerned with telling the player whether his character succeeds in something or not; those rules describe responsibilities and limitations, not rights. I would imagine that if the Golden Rule was really intended to be applied democratically, these games would have rules that resemble Universalis rather more than they do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266227/#Comment_266227" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T20:00:04+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  8:00PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>So what did Story-Games spring from?</blockquote>\nAndy basically decided that he wanted a more socially relaxed environment for chatting about games than the Forge, which is rather far from your average discussion forum as an environment. Most of the SG participants tend to have some history with the Forge and the games that originate there, but then part of the spice here is definitely that not everybody is as agreeable about the foundational cultural ideas of the Forge as some. Lately Story Games has also started to get more and more people who don't have any relationship with the Forge, but rather just want to participate at Story Games for what it is itself - a lively, generally sociable environment for discussing roleplaying games.<br/><br/>As for everything from the '90s being evil, that's a gross simplification of the ideas and historical understanding developed at the Forge. I'm sure that Jason intended that as a joke, though, so no big deal. I won't deny that the Forge would likely not exist if there were not theoretical, practical and financial problems in the way the roleplaying scene developed through the '90s. It started as a reaction to what existed at the time, and one might even think that the success of the Forge is a pretty good argument for the truth of the claims about the problems in the roleplaying culture of the '90s; if it were all sunshine and puppies, why ever would we have bothered with the Forge instead of happily playing Tri-Stat every week? Even a little bit of intellectual respect should indicate that whether common or not, those of us who've found the Forge worthwhile have had valid personal experiences with roleplaying that made it us agree about things in the way that would become the Forge culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266228/#Comment_266228" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T20:21:53+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  8:21PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>That being said, though, I do agree with everybody saying that the "good" Golden Rule is perfectly reasonable as an attitude for a group wanting to do it - but my experience also agrees in that I've<i>never</i>seen a game group that would apply the Golden Rule as a group; it's always the GM who is the driving creative force in these games, so he's the one who decides how the rules will be used, when they will be ignored and so on.</blockquote>\nOh, definitely. The GM has a disproportional amount of input into the creative work of the campaign. Most of the time they're the ones in the best position to see a problem, sometimes they're the only ones that have a problem, yet it becomes a group problem because they can't get done what they want to get done with the tool they have and everyone can see the world stuttering and jumping like frames missing from a film. A bad judgment call in Golden-Rule-ing something by the GM can screw things up bigtime for the rest of the group. But so can any number of other non-Golden-Rule bad judgment calls by GMs. That's part of the danger of having a GM, or not valuing training and helping them! <br/><br/>I should note that plenty of Forge-influenced games have regular ole GMs like 90s games do, though, with no real difference in their "creative director of the fiction" position.  That's not a mistake.  Having a GM is a very powerful and effective tool for a game, it has lots of good effects as well as running some risks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266230/#Comment_266230" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T20:29:34+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  8:29PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have raised so many glasses to you on this thread, JDCorley, that I am now quite drunk.<br/><br/>I'll add something relevant and say that in my adult gaming experience (when I took it up for the second time in my life), the GMs tended to drive a lot of the discussion around how we would customize our games and often had a final say if there wasn't a strong preference, but each of us as players had a voice, both during the crafting of the campaign and during the running and we could make changes.<br/><br/>I do think there is a strong role for system in this equation, but this idea that a whole swath of games, because of their system, created this autocratic hierarchy with the GM on top and tons of damaged, negative relationships, is ignoring all the other relevant factors, factors which still exist today in and out of the storygames scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266237/#Comment_266237" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T21:55:54+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  9:55PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "high school and college gaming" versus gaming-as-adults is another pretty important structural detail related to the functionality of techniques like the Golden Rule or Rule Zero.

I also note that those favourite games of mine all share the property that the GM's role, duties and powers are well-defined and supportive of the type of play I want to get out of the game - and more importantly, of the type the game claims to provide. The failure of the traditional GM role is not in that it's a GM, it's in pretending that the GM is an arbitrarily-powerful auteur who is not empowered by the rules, but rather by his own will to power. That's how this seems to me: deconstructionist games provide rules according to which a role like "GM" might be defined, while a traditional game assumes that you already have a GM, and it's just a matter of giving him some tools he would like to use in bringing his vision to the table. Games I play nowadays do not have the Golden Rule - even the ones that do in the game text, I'll ignore it.<br/><br/>(In case anybody is interested, I can certainly do close textual readings of some of my favourite alternative-style rpgs to show how the superficially traditional GM role is actually procedurally well-defined and quite different from traditional wisdom when understood within the context these games are offered in. A topic for another thread, to be sure.)<br/><br/>There's one auteur-GMed game that I like, <i>Dread</i>. I adore how the game doesn't make any bones about being auteuristic, one-directional storytelling exercise that is not going to work unless you have a story and you want to entertain your friends by telling it. There are no rules for kewl powerz, no skill checks, no doling out experience points; just pure interactive storytelling immersion, and if you want to play the game, you better rise up to it and provide your friends a show they won't forget. All of the rules in the game are not actually so much rules as mechanical tools the GM can use to help him do his job. The game's GMing advice carries out this mission with flair, outlining a crash-course in horror storytelling, dramatics and other necessary advice the GM needs. The lack of pretend-freedom makes the game work in a powerful and uncomplicated manner when the GM doesn't have to pretend that the players have any input into the direction of the story.<br/><br/>Of course any of these games under discussion can be played in different ways that do not suffer of the weaknesses pinpointed in them. Still, the fact that they can be used in different ways doesn't exactly do anything to change the fact that in many places they were not used functionally before we got ameliorating theory and techniques from independent sources. Specifically, defending a given style of game-writing on the basis of gnosis - hidden knowledge - doesn't seem effective to me; it well might be the case that heroic, adult, expert GMs have been masterfully able to run these games, subtly ignoring some bits and reading others creatively, but that doesn't do anything to counter the fact that others who've lacked the gnosis have not been able to make the same leap. In this situation I think that I'm perfectly entitled to appreciate later games that have been more successful and honest in explicitly laying out the procedures of play that are actually effective. Such games have thus been successful in influencing my own play towards new directions where old games have only succeeded in affirming my understanding that all roleplaying games are essentially the same game in new clothes.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Anyway, defending or denigrating traditional games is something of a secondary point, considering the topic of the thread. What we were discussing was whether a mainstream tradition of gaming even exists. Jason: how would you explain the existence of the concept of Golden Rule as something outside individual game texts if it's not being carried by tradition? What is the force that makes us read this concept into the different game texts that each have their own, somewhat different explanations of what the GM's role is or what good roleplaying is? After all, it seems that you do recognize that there is such a principle as the Golden Rule, separate from how the principle is explained in WoD games or the new Warhammer or Silver Age Sentinels (to mention a couple of games that provide the Golden Rule explicitly).<br/><br/>Your answer might be that the Golden Rule is an universal element of roleplaying that necessarily arises in a functional hobby completely irregardless of any Zeitgeist or lineages of influence. However, am I then just deluded when I claim that my gaming has not been relying on the Golden Rule for the last decade? How is it possible that the Golden Rule is a well-understood and integral part of play for some people, while it's anything but for others, if there is no distinct tradition or subculture of play that enforces and transmits the idea of the Golden Rule?<br/><br/>To put the above in other words: you've been critiquing the concept of "trad gaming" on the grounds that there are no real differences between games that ostensibly belong in the tradition or are part of a new wave - or those that precede the tradition, for that matter. Would you still say this if I suggested that the existence and acceptance of the Golden Rule is a clear example of the type of game design and play philosophy that is typical of the tradition we're talking about here? Wouldn't this be the type of clear, important difference that justifies separating styles of game design into separate boxes like this? I'm not saying that the tradition is exhaustively characterized by the Golden Rule, but it does seem like a clear, concrete example of terminology and world-view that I recognize as belonging to the tradition and which I don't use myself. Other traits of the tradition may also be recognized and refined, but the realistic scope of a single discussion seems to prevent it - perhaps we might each of us consider writing about this in length once we have had more time to think about it? I'm sort of interested in this idea that I need to defend the existence of the gaming mainstream, seems right up my alley as a rpg theory challenge <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266246/#Comment_266246" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T23:19:46+00:00" title="April  8, 2010 11:19PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2010 11:42PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Your answer might be that the Golden Rule is an universal element of roleplaying that necessarily arises in a functional hobby completely irregardless of any Zeitgeist or lineages of influence.

I mean, you could call that a tradition, but it applies to Fiasco as much as to AD&amp;D, and I'm pretty sure that's verboten.<br/><br/>Edit: As for your non-Golden-Rule gaming, as I say, sure, there are plenty of people out there who, when they have a shitty time, just throw away the game, or those that use torturous inferences and interpretations of game texts to get to where they want without saying "we're changing this", so I have no doubt that you might be one of these people. But that happened in 1979, 1986, 1995 and 2007, to games that included the Golden Rule explicitly and those that didn't, and even some that have tried to disclaim it, so again, we haven't identified a tradition that includes some games and excludes others.<br/><br/>I can imagine, and I've heard, that many groups have a shitty time playing a game, and don't change it, and don't play anything else. I might, if you really pressed me, say that they formed a separate tradition from the rest, but I suspect that groups like that gain some other perverse benefit that keeps them from changing the game (Golden Rule) or throwing it away despite their perhaps overall bad experience. Not having any real connection with people or groups like that, I only theorize here, of course.<br/><br/>Double edit: I should add, my point is <i>not</i> that there are no differences between "new wave" games and other games, but that the degree of difference between them is not appreciably greater than the differences already existent in the hobby. In other words, the difference between, say, With Great Power and Mutants and Masterminds is about the same as the difference between Beyond the Supernatural and Ghostbusters, or perhaps a bit less than say, between Fiasco and Burning Empires.  The hobby has always been big and diverse and constantly gaining diversity. It's not that there's nothing new under the sun. It's that there's <i>always</i> something new under the sun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266255/#Comment_266255" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T01:35:29+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  1:35AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2010 2:07AM by ping.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>I think "high school and college gaming" versus gaming-as-adults is another pretty important structural detail related to the functionality of techniques like the Golden Rule or Rule Zero. </blockquote> I've been contemplating this whole thing more, and now I really think that where we are in our social and life development is the defining factor in our gaming culture, even more cemented if everyone in the group is basically at the same place.<br/><br/>Many of us seem to have been doing the same thing at the same age in relative vacuums without the constant chatter of the internets and yet we developed similar "traditions." Everyone in my group needing to be a special snowflake was a product of the people and not any system. When I see snowflake-itis come out in story/indie gaming now, typically in younger and less mature players, I think, "That used to be me playing GURPS." EDIT - I take this back. I give quite a bit of credit to this thread and especially Johnzo for reminding me that I was those guys once.<br/><br/>We knew there were lots of different systems out there (and now I know there was an even larger variety of games available if we had bothered to look - Hi, Flashing Blades!) and we did play them occasionally. I reflect that I wasn't self-aware enough as a gamer to see that system could influence play and therefore to be open to new ideas of play. Rather I thought system defined genre and hence as Johnzo said, I just layered the familiar on the unfamiliar and kept old paradigms going.<br/><br/>Actually, this reminds me of something Ben R. said to me recently that story/indie games are too often pitched by their genre and not by their paradigm. So, maybe we haven't changed much - but that's a different conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266261/#Comment_266261" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T02:11:51+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  2:11AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That age argument is a pretty convincing explanation for why people have similar experiences in gaming. I think that's something to think on in depth. I don't have a problem with juggling multiple cultural influences at once, so for myself it remains to be seen how much this explanation really explains vs. the traditional lineage explanation. I doubt that age or social class or other such background factors are exhaustive as explanations, considering how different types of gaming still have apparently risen at different times in the hobby; if the age of the players were decisive, then we'd have seen the type of play that's been described in this thread as "traditional" rise a decade earlier than it did; there were teenagers playing roleplaying games in 1985 just like in 1995, except there were probably more of them.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I've been playing with teenagers quite a bit through the last five years. The experience has of course been completely contaminated in that the teens have not been in the cargo cult situation I was at their age, and they have an experienced roleplayer playing with them and being the GM most of the time. If nothing else, I'm usually there to rebuke them for unvirtuous action at the gaming table. Is the fact that the gamers I've watched grow up through these years have avoided the problems I had during the '90s an indication that the games we've played (Forge games, most of the time) don't engender those problems, or is it that an older gamer can teach them and thus help them avoid problems? For my own part I have to say that I believe that both of those are factors; almost definitely the teens wouldn't have been able to play with the clarity and purpose we did if they'd been doing it without me, but then on the other hand I wouldn't have been able to do it, either, without having high-performance game texts to work with.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>A bit more on the Golden Rule thing: both Accounting and Jason seem to agree that the Golden Rule is an essential component of roleplaying, and thus any currency it might gain at given points in time and space is incidental and perhaps indicative of the rising quality of gaming, rather than a sign of a specific type, school or tradition of roleplaying. Fair enough, insofar as opinions go - I think I'm pretty willing to leave that point for the reader to consider, as to me it seems obvious that something like the Golden Rule is definitely a cultural artifact; there have been and currently exist wide swatches of gaming culture where treating a game, ontologically speaking, as a mere arbitrary tool in fulfilling an external purpose is seen as alien.<br/><br/>Even granting the characterization of the Golden Rule either way, it seems to me that my disagreement with Jason boils down to the analytic evaluation of the differences between games. We both agree in that games obviously have differences between them, and even games that I'd characterize as belonging in a single tradition have many differences between them. The further evaluation of those differences, however, seems to be so different for us that hardly any dialogue is possible: to me it seems obvious that we can take a game apart and analyze it for fundamental and incidental properties, tracing the evolution of ideas between game texts and ultimately mapping an understanding of cultural trends influencing the whole. That understanding might not accord with the concept of traditional gaming sketched in this thread, but it would at least exist. Jason seems to be arguing that the cultural history of roleplaying is essentially chaotic; not only are games all different from each other, but we also can't elevate any differences apart from others, and therefore can't really say anything about trends of design or actual play. As Jason says: "The hobby has always been big and diverse and constantly gaining diversity. It's not that there's nothing new under the sun. It's that there's <i>always</i> something new under the sun."<br/><br/>Just as with the evaluation of the Golden Rule and whether it exists inherently in gaming or represents a specific cultural choice, I'm willing to leave the whole matter of whether a gaming tradition can be said to exist for the reader to consider; I think I've said my piece on it, and so has Jason. The research material in the form of game texts and descriptions of play is available for everybody, so at least until somebody buckles down to do serious historiography, we'll have to be satisfied to explain the impressions we've developed through our own experiences and then let the reader make his own call as to the truth of the matter based on their own experiences and erudition.<br/><br/>I will reserve the option to do a blog post on the historiography of the mainstream tradition, though <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> It's an interesting topic!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266267/#Comment_266267" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T03:24:41+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  3:24AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2010 4:00AM by ping.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>if the age of the players were decisive, then we'd have seen the type of play that's been described in this thread as "traditional" rise a decade earlier than it did; there were teenagers playing roleplaying games in 1985 just like in 1995, except there were probably more of them.</blockquote>To be clear, it's the maturity and self-awareness of the players, things that are only somewhat correlated to age. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> There have been a lot of words in this thread, so I've lost track of which specific things people don't think were happening in the 70's/80's.

Left up to their own devices, the kids would have to discover the hard way what their own gaming boundaries are. Maybe they would beat each other up or be petty and petulant to resolve conflict as kids do, but they wouldn't do that in front of an adult. It goes without saying you learn differently when struggling together with your peers than under the guidance of an authority figure so the question is: You say they avoided a lot of the problems you encountered, and I completely believe that, but on the other hand, what did they miss out on by not having as many peer-only gaming experiences?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266274/#Comment_266274" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T05:37:25+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  5:37AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In addition to age, it may be time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe internet makes it easier to find people who share your interests.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr at least connect to more people in general till you find those you are compatible with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266280/#Comment_266280" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T06:11:46+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  6:11AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not so sure about the age thing, at least not as a broad brush.

I basically dropped out of the hobby between 1989 and 1998 other than one small and occasional group - when I came back, I felt that most of the people I met had completely different ideas about how this was supposed to work than I did. Most of them reported either having come into the hobby through 90s-era RPGs OR through strongly cult-of-the-GM "West Coast" early-D&amp;D and Rolemaster play cultures.<br><br>I really think that the key difference here is about power distribution and the assumptions about social and creative roles at the table.

Certainly Dragon Magazine along with other publications were jiust  chock full of variants for systems and players were generally encouraged to hack away.<br/><br/>Heck Gygax's rant about AD&amp;D's officialness sticks out because it was so seemingly at odds with how people were actually playing.<br/><br/>Age of players and gaming...<br/>Actually, I think it's a pretty big, important factor. I don't know why anyone would think otherwise actually. After all, we look at other social contexts that gaming exists in and look at how that affects playstyle. Why not age as well?<br/><br/>I wish I could find the blog post again, but someone recently was discussing TSR's decision to gear marketing of D&amp;D towards tweens following the release of Moldvay Basic. That's actually a pretty big shift in the game right there and comes at the same time as D&amp;D achieves fad status.<br/><br/>I'd also point out that if you started playing as a tween around 1980, you'd be a young 20 something or late teen right about the same time Vampire hit the scene a decade or so later.<br/><br/>Both games ended up hitting the same people. Not just the same market demographic- <i>the exact same people</i>.Notably, those folks, the Boxed Set Generation, were significantly younger than the 70s grognards with one foot in the hex'n'chit wargame hobby and the other in RPGs. By the time Vamp hit, the grogs were hitting Career and Family time and had been for a few years. They were, unshockingly, going through the Mid20s-Early 30s Gamer Slowdown and becoming less influential on the direction games were taking, while the BSGers were becoming more influential.<br/><br/>And Vamp became popular on the back of that shift. With the grogs out, tactical bean-counting dropped in importance. Teeny power fantasy dropped lower in importance while late Teen/Young 20 something angsty coolness fantasy grew.<br/><br/>And the GM changed too. No longer a Referee like the grogs may hae recognized ( that role still exists in the many, many wargames being played out there at conventions and clubs, especially among minis gamers), the GM was making <b>art!</b> Kinda-sorta anyway. And the players, through their character portrayal/immersion, too, were making <b>art!</b>, also kinda-sorta.<br/><br/>In any case, the most assuredly weren't engaging in teeny power fantasies anymore, because, y'know we're all cool young adults now. Except of course, when we were.<br/><br/>This dirty-hippy game design direction that we see around these parts? I just look at it as one more result of the aging of a segment of the BSG. Life has changed, and designs reflect that. The urge to use RAW and at the designer end to make games that work RAW and don't require or encourage a whole lot of haking fits with the different point in life folks have reached. Narrative sharing, simple mechanics, a move away from physics simulation designs- Yeah, that stuff all fits IMO.<br/><br/>Hell even face stabbiness, go for the throat/get to the point playstyle does too. For one thing, at a certain point in life, you can look at a game as, well, just a game.

I'm not surprised that the traditions mentioned in this thread extend that far back, though; my understanding of the matter is that gaming has been developing mostly organically since the early '80s (and possibly even before; I don't know enough about the shift in emphasis from the original wargamey styles into modern mainstream to say if the shift was evolutionary or revolutionary, so to speak), with new ideas coming along mostly as emphasis has shifted from early styles into the unified, solidly industrialized tradition. I'm especially fond of <i>Dragonlance</i> as a very half-way product: you can still see the old sandbox adventure premises in it as dead rituals performed for the benefit of the players, who would still expect to be in charge of certain things, but there's also the clear overlay of GM responsibility for keeping the train on track through the grand epic.<br/><br/>How common would you consider cheating in early '80s rpg texts and discussion? I'm asking because it seems to me that GM cheating is an important part of what makes the Golden Rule cultural construct what it is. I don't quite see the Golden Rule in mere houseruling, myself - happening on the spot and being predicated on a GM preconception of a story is what I usually think of when the Golden Rule is considered. I've understood myself that while individual adventure modules and campaigns would increasingly showcase railroading techniques and a concern with GM-planned plotting, actual game texts that would directly advocate for the GM to take the conscious burden of plot would still be years away. For instance, I don't remember that the AD&amp;D 2nd edition DMG (1989) would have depicted a particularly railroady adventure structure even while actual adventure publications of the time favoured increased modernism. AD&amp;D is an admittedly conservative game to date anything by, of course - <i>Ars Magica</i> from the same era is much more modern, I seem to remember.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266299/#Comment_266299" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T08:24:53+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  8:24AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>How common would you consider cheating in early '80s rpg texts and discussion?

The decision to put a goblin or an orc in a room is essentially arbitrary, and switching it from a goblin to an orc when the door is actually kicked open is just as arbitrary. A lot of people use the term "cheating" (or "lying, deception"), when it seems clear to me that what's really happening is sleight-of-hand. The same sort of people would rush the stage at a magician's performance and knock over his props and yell "THE BUNNY WAS IN THE TABLE ALL ALONG", or confusedly look at the screen and say "Why is everyone calling that person Danny Ocean when you can see clearly it's George Clooney?" or perhaps more fairly, would consider the second part of Rashomon disgusting, after observing the first part.  "Why is the filmmaker changing things after he got me to believe the first thing?!" The main problem with the early GM role was not that it broke the rules, its that there were no meaningful rules to break, leaving you, creatively, with a wide open field with no limitations and players who might have a lot narrower preferences than you.  The very best early GM roles were ones where it gave great advice for how to get everyone on the same page, as a result: Paranoia, Vampire (and progeny), Cyberpunk (to a degree), Call of Cthulhu. D&amp;D's DM advice would not catch up to these early standards until third edition, then it did a great job in the DMG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266300/#Comment_266300" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T08:31:46+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  8:31AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry Eero, I added a bunch of meandering stuff while you were responding.<br/><br/>Hrm.<br/><br/>Over the 80s, I think you start to see a couple key changes.<br/><br/>First, location based or mission play drop out, but everyone is experiementing with exactly what the heck that means and how to accomplish it.<br/><br/>At the same time, playing in-character becomes more important than tactical-bean-counting.<br/><br/>I mean, the dungeon itself is a weird concept. People rapidly want to try other stuff, staring from the early70s on. The early attempts are more like, I dunno, mission-based. Now you aren't just hitting a particular dungeon, you can wander and do other stuff in between, but really, you still end up at a dungeon or someting like it somewhere.<br/><br/>And there is a certain amount of railroadiness in that already. Besides Dragonlance, look at old TSR Marvel Superheroes, Top Secret, or Indiana Jones modules. Or Star Frontiers modules. They're all these transitional products trying to bridge a sort of mental gap between a very wargamery approach and a more story (sequence of connected events) approachYet they're also being sold in an environment where sandbox world playstyle is another important vein of play culture along with player control of character.<br/><br/>It's a little fragmented to say the least!<br/><br/>GM cheating is tricky. As a play goal, I'd say that part of the GM's job was seen as <i>keeping the game going</i>, no matter what. And, from the early 80s, to neither be a Killer GM nor a Monty Haul GM.<br/><br/>Given the rapid increase in time and complexity of chargen in games during that period (late 70s/early 80s) it was not in the GM's interest to see dead characters, so...cheating!<br/><br/>It was also a period of increased player attachment to characters and an expectation that GMs were going to have much more interest in intricate world building ( or at least world use if you grabbed a setting off the shelf). That's a lot of work on both ends, so again, Character Death = Teh Baddness.<br/><br/>So again...cheating. Especially since a lot of the game mechanics were still heavily influenced by a strong physics simulation urge going back to 70s style wargaming.<br/><br/>With that idea that <i>Cheating is Important to Maintain Our Fun </i>in place already, and the full force of RAW telling us that a GM sometimes had to make on-the-fly decisions regarding things not in the rules ( usually some weird, not-covered, physics-engine thing), the ground work was laid for the <i>Cheating to Maintain Story Which Is What We All Want ( because we're cool angsty young adults and not teenies playing power fantasies, no, really stop laughing you bloody grognards!)</i> of the 90s.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266301/#Comment_266301" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T08:42:58+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  8:42AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find the dichotomy of Rule Zero and Anti-Rule Zero (i.e. the rules are inviolate) is about as useful for understanding how people take a game text and turn it into what happens during play as the dichotomy of Roll Under and Roll Over is useful for understanding the design of game mechanics. I mean, sure, they are abstractly opposites and you can see some extreme things happen when either is taken as all there is, but ultimately they are each one little piece of much, much bigger puzzles. <br/><br/>In the very least, "we follow the rules", or "we can change the rules if necessary", or "the GM can change the rules if necessary" are social conventions handed to the group - and extremely blunt ones at that. The truth is almost certainly real people were not playing some silly extreme version, but a nuanced consensus (or if no consensus was reached, the group likely fell apart) on the subject of what was good faith attempts to follow potentially confusing rules, what was solutions for situations outside of the rules or to address specific group needs, and what was driven by group comfort level. And almost certainly this consensus would evolve, as would the methods for achieving it. <br/><br/>And while the game texts and some of the external elements (such as the expectations before playing the game) are different, I expect the methods of achieving consensus on how the game is played still evolve in using much the same methods whether you are playing a traditional or an indie game. <br/><br/>- Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266306/#Comment_266306" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T09:15:18+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  9:15AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2010 9:19AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some great points in this thread on all sides of the debate, and it's an enjoyable read.<br/><br/>One thing to consider is to remember that games are fundamentally a social pastime, and for a group of people to engage in a game together, they must collectively decide to trust one another. How that trust is allocated is an important distinction. The "Forge culture", for instance, places a high onus on the group placing a large amount of trust in the game designer. When a game goes poorly, it is not considered "bad form" to post about it online, demanding an explanation for why the game "failed to perform"--often directly from the designer. In what some people are reporting as their experience of 90s/mainstream/traditional roleplaying, that trust is placed primarily in the GM: the GM is expected to perform, whether using the game's design or despite its problems. A game that is not much fun (wild asshole behaviour from the players aside) is/was often seen as a failure on the part of the GM to "make good", including throwing out or ignoring rules and making up new ones.<br/><br/>In the proto-culture of early roleplaying (Gygax et al), my impression is that GMs and referees were all also game designers and/or tinkerers, and thus these roles were easily conflated. But as the tradition spreads and diversifies, this seems like a meaningful distinction. <br/><br/>I think it's a notable factor that a group which places authority and trust in the hands of one member, who is then responsible for a large portion of the group's fun, is more likely to face interpersonal problems or social conflict when things go bad. One which sees itself as a team, and lays responsibility and trust in the hands of another person, not present (such as the designer), is perhaps more likely to avoid such struggles. What do you think? That says something meaningful about the "Forge approach", and perhaps correlates closely to factors such as age, experience in handling group situations, and maturity. (I'm not saying the approach is more mature; only that someone with more experience of game failure might be drawn to this version of trust distribution over the other.)<br/><br/>I'd like to humbly suggest that, given what's been written upthread, there is a slight misunderstanding about this "Golden Rule". Eero has brought up an important point, which is that this "tradition" (whether textual, or as reported by various people on this forum) often contains the idea that the GM's authority over the game supersedes the authority of the game played. Yes, we're agreeing to play by certain rules as a group, but the GM is above that--we give her the authority to change those without notice and without requiring concensus from the group. I'm sure we can think of many examples of game texts that explicitly address the GM in a different section of the text than the players and advise to keep rules secret, change them, fudge dice rolls (secretly; not in the open), etc., sometimes even combined with the strident warning that the players should not read that section.<br/><br/>Jason (Corley), on the other hand, everything you've posted here seems to me to be describing a <i>group</i>'s handling of play--we agree to change this because it doesn't work for us; we play the game <i>this</i> way, because it's more fun for us. I totally agree with your proposition that every game becomes slightly different as soon as it is played by a real, live group of people. But what do you think of the observation that there has existed a sort of tradition that authorized, expected, and even elevated one player's right to change the rules of the game <i>without</i> the group's consent? I know I've definitely seen this in action in my roleplaying experience, and often enough (maybe more than 50% of the time): "the GM is the system". As far as I can tell from what you've written above, you've been talking about the Golden Rule as a group phenomenon, and haven't addressed this particular (variation? version? tradition?) of the Golden Rule. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this one!<br/><br/><i>edit: massively cross-posted!

Long form games are more susceptible to "mutation" style changes in play, as the game is played based on previous sessions rather than on the initial starting point (which given the more extensive investment may have been more carefully tied to the text). On the other hand, short form games are most susceptible to "translation" changes in play, as there is much less chance for a later correction of a comprehension error or simply a change in interpretation. <br/><br/>Now if the text (or the designer) has high status then there is a strong tendency to modify toward re-interpretations of the text and if a player has high status (GM or otherwise), then there is a tendency to modify toward that player's preferences. (This symmetry is why I keep telling people to treat the game text as a player who has just left the room.) Of course you can have multiple such status issues, not to mention changes in status occurring during play. But you can imagine a tradition that holds a GM as top dog, or gives the most status to prima donna players, or to the rules lawyer can all have a distinctive effect on the dynamic. <br/><br/>And none of this is even considering the case where people are actively changing the "rules" or the social dynamics. House rules, overt fudging (GM or player), rule extensions, rule bypasses, and what not are above and beyond this. <br/><br/>But that caveat aside, I hope you can see how an "all players are equal" (although some more equal than others) tradition of short form games can, using the same consensus methods, arrive at very different sorts of variations on the game than a GM is highest status tradition of long form games. This will be true even if they both have a very high respect for the designer/rule book (analogous to Anti-Rule Zero) or a very low respect (analogous to Rule Zero). <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266323/#Comment_266323" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T11:02:16+00:00" title="April  9, 2010 11:02AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I think it's a notable factor that a group which places authority and trust in the hands of one member, who is then responsible for a large portion of the group's fun, is more likely to face interpersonal problems or social conflict when things go bad.

YOUR BULLETS HAVE NO EFFECT!<br/><br/>That matches both my actual experience and my interpretation of predominate game texts of the time.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266329/#Comment_266329" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T11:46:32+00:00" title="April  9, 2010 11:46AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have had this exact conversation more than once with people who have internalized this model of play.<br/><br/>Me: "Sp you're telling me that he just completely changed the rules on you in the middle of the session?"<br/>Her: "Yep.

After that, their options were play along or quit the game.<br/><br/>The idea is definitely out there in the wild that GM authority means NO input by lowly players except through in-fiction means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266330/#Comment_266330" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T11:52:24+00:00" title="April  9, 2010 11:52AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2010 11:58AM by JDCorley.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't doubt it, I've experienced that before myself, but I'm baffled as to where it comes from. I sure don't see it in the game texts and it wasn't widespread after 9th grade in my groups...maybe it's the age thing again. Rather than following the instructions that say that rule changes are for consistency and that the story benefits from player involvement, the 14 year old inside me says "they're attacking ME!" when they hear a question/critique, and furious defensiveness must result.  I guess this is getting back to what I was saying earlier that there are tons of non-Golden-Rule related bad judgment calls a GM can make that can ruin a game, so to single out the Golden Rule as a particularized problem seems weird to me. Yes, GMs can fuck up their games, but they don't need the Golden Rule to do that, GMs were fucking up their games long before anyone thought to write that down.<br/><br/>I thought of something else here too. I don't understand how the alternative to trusting a fellow player in the role of GM is trusting a designer. I mean, in Primetime Adventures, to no significant extent can I say I trust the author of the book with making good play for me. If I'm sitting next to someone whose contributions to the fiction I despise and who I think is getting every possible dramatic and comedic note exactly wrong, it really isn't the author's fault, is it? And this is a game in which the responsibilities previously given to a GM are at least in part spread around the group.  Fiasco too.<br/><br/>Edit: I would add, the "do what the GM says or quit" sounds a hell of a lot to me like "do what the designer says or quit", in "non-Golden-Rule play", as described above, and just as bad, or good, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266335/#Comment_266335" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T12:17:59+00:00" title="April  9, 2010 12:17PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD,<br/><br/>Because games are organized activities.  The ACTIVITY is either fun or it isn't.  If the activity is FIXED then I can can critique your skills at doing that activity.  I might hate you as a person but I can talk about how good or bad you are as a bowler independent of that.  I can also meaningfully say when you have violated the bounds of the activity.<br/><br/>RPGs of course require more shared creative commitment than bowling but the principle is the same.  Because the activity is fixed I can give meaningful critique of your Primetime Adventures skills vs. your Dogs in the Vineyard skills.  I can also call you on when you have stepped outside the bounds prescribed by the activity at hand.<br/><br/>I can give no meaningful critique of your Vampire skills because there is no meaningful definition of the activity of Vampire.  I also can not call you on stepping outside the bounds of the activity because the text tells you that there are no bounds to the activity.  The activity you made Vampire into seems to be pretty cool but I can't meaningfully say you're a better Vampire player than anyone else because there is no fixed standard by which to judge that.<br/><br/>I can meaningfully critique a GM on his Dogs in the Vineyard technique.  Dan doesn't reveal his town fast enough, there's too much investigation.  Bob doesn't play his NPCs aggressively enough there's too much exposition.  But because we know what the activity is, GM reveal the problems of the town, Players solve the problems, conflicts are resolved this way, etc then we can make those judgments.  If the GM suddenly says, "You shoot him and nothing happens" we know he has done something WRONG.  Dogs in the Vineyard includes no such "legal move" on the part of the GM.  He has stepped outside the bounds of the activity and ANYONE including *an outside observer who is not a member of the group* can clearly identify that as an "illegal move" in the activity described in the text of Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>Now if you go bowling and you let your friends step over the foul line and you're all cool with that then okay, whatever.  But we can still identify that as not "legal" bowling.  Localized to you it's fine but in terms of what "bowling" is understood to be by the wider community of bowlers who seek to gain greater bowling skill.<br/><br/>When I agree to bowl with you, that is short hand for, "I agree to engage with you on the terms prescribed by the activity known as bowling."  If you suddenly start stepping over the foul line and not blinking an eye about it I feel violated.  If I say, "Dude, you stepped over the foul line," and you just shrug, "It's my bowling party, they're just guidelines." then I walk.  I'm not here for your bowling party, I'm here to bowl.<br/><br/>That's all I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266337/#Comment_266337" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T12:20:01+00:00" title="April  9, 2010 12:20PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the GM as god mentality goes back to the start, Old School D&amp;D; where the rules of the simulation werent very detailed so it was expected that the GM would have to make rulings on how things worked and his word was final.  Of course those players were coming to the game from a point of view of wargames and understood the concept of an impartial judge and that role the GM was taking on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I started in the late 70's early 80's we werent coming from the perspective of wargamers.  What really attracted us was the fantasy genre with the connection to things like the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, Conan comics, Knights of the Round table, Robin Hood and the plethora of fantasy books that started to come out at that time.  The setting of the game connected with those influences quite well but the rules of the games really didnt.  There wasnt a proceedure to create an epic storyline or any type of storyline and I know I fumbled about with how to do that, I'm sure plenty of others did as well.  The Dragonlance series of modules really were the first to attempt to put out a big storyline and the solution was pretty much to lay down train tracks and force the players in the direction the modules led.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a lot of assumptions about how to play from that original style of GM as impartial arbiter whose word was god became traditions that stuck and continued through the GM as author era, even when they werent necessary for play but were just vestigial remnants of how things were done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266338/#Comment_266338" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T12:21:24+00:00" title="April  9, 2010 12:21PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "One thing to consider is to remember that games are fundamentally a social pastime, and for a group of people to engage in a game together, they must collectively decide to trust one another."<br><br>Why?<br><br>I really don't understand all this language about trust.

If you look at organizational dynamics, it is often the groups built on the most democratic principles that tend to end up with the worst interpersonal problems.  Look at the failure of all the various social experiments in the '60s.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>I'd like to humbly suggest that, given what's been written upthread, there is a slight misunderstanding about this "Golden Rule". Eero has brought up an important point, which is that this "tradition" (whether textual, or as reported by various people on this forum) often contains the idea that the GM's authority over the game supersedes the authority of the game played. Yes, we're agreeing to play by certain rules as a group, but the GM is above that--we give her the authority to change those without notice and without requiring concensus from the group. I'm sure we can think of many examples of game texts that explicitly address the GM in a different section of the text than the players and advise to keep rules secret, change them, fudge dice rolls (secretly; not in the open), etc., sometimes even combined with the strident warning that the players should not read that section.</blockquote>\nJDCorley already made the distinction between The Golden Rule and Rule Zero.  What you are doing here is simply re-conflating them.  The whole point of the Golden Rule is that it is the group's responsibility to do what they want with the game.  At any given time, the GM may have a certain authority or deciding factor, but this is not necessarily so and not necessarily a function of the system being used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266345/#Comment_266345" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T12:40:51+00:00" title="April  9, 2010 12:40PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark W and Jesse, those are just examples of bad GMs.  Yes, you can isolate out the zones of the potential for such bad behaviour with design, but in doing so you may also eliminate elements that are potential for fun and good behaviour.  <br/><br/>When I GM, I see the dice and the mechanics as the neutralizer.  They are the gateway, the filters for all of our individual imaginations to pass and meet in the shared imaginary space.  So if something comes up that isn't specifically covered in the rules, then I defer to the base mechanic and the dice.  Either out loud or sometimes without saying if it's a case where suspense may be a key, I will quickly come up with a reasonable scale against which to roll.  If the players are the ones to roll, I let them argue for bonuses that are relevant.  Then we roll and the result is what stands.  <br/><br/>This has been common practice in my group since the mid '90s when we first started with 3.5.  Chance and the system decide, with GM and player negotiating for how much the results can be influenced.<br/><br/>When you eliminate that open space that isn't covered by the rules, you lose the potential for really interesting things to happen.  To me, that's where the magic of roleplaying is, when multiple ideas come together and are shaped by the randomness of the dice and the structure of the system.  It's that combo of chaos (randomness) and order (the rules structure) that makes life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266346/#Comment_266346" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T12:46:20+00:00" title="April  9, 2010 12:46PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/>I can give no meaningful critique of your Vampire skills because there is no meaningful definition of the activity of Vampire.

I mean, in your example, you critiqued the activity of playing that imaginary game pretty obviously. If you can't draw an aesthetic judgment about play and say "I like this" or "I don't like this", what is this whole thing about?

I assure you, plenty of people did and do and continued to do so in this very thread!  I don't get this, like at all.  Can outside observers (or participants - I don't know why they have to be outside) experience a session of Dogs and experience different levels of enjoyment (or in the case of observers, judge their potential level of enjoyment in participating) based on their differing preferences? Of course, nobody could say differently. Similarly, two different people might watch the same Vampire session and go "wow, that was cool" or "meh, I didn't like that NPC's funny voice" (or whatever) and judge its success in meeting their preferences that way.<br/><br/>I agree with you that communication is key. If you show up for Serious Roleplay (tm) and we're all joshing around slapping each other on the back and getting drunk, that can be even more damaging to your enjoyment than a bad rules call or a badly drawn NPC.  And very few games give even a nod towards the importance of this communication - including "new wave" games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266355/#Comment_266355" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T13:15:43+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  1:15PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The GM of, say, a Vampire game, is going to be in the best position to see a problem coming down the pike because they have more knowledge about the game and more control over what to do about approaching (or present) problems.

That's a nontrivial chunk of someone's mortal hours on Earth<br/><br/>The cost of participation that my friends are paying means that the expectation that led them to pay that price is pretty important and needs to be respected.  So yeah, anytime I feel the urge to change up the implied or explicit group contract, I'm gonna seek consent.  To do otherwise would be to bait and switch.<br/><br/>For example, early on in our 4E campaign, I wasn't sure if I liked the speed of character development.  It felt too slow.  So I proposed doubling XP awards for monsters.  One of the players thought the pace of development was just fine, as he felt that it gave him an opportunity to explore his power set during each level -- and he *really* enjoys exploration of rulesets.  I could have just doubled things invisibly, but I'd be robbing my friend of one of his primary game pleasures just so I could service an uneasy feeling.<br/><br/>Maybe this is all a bit dramatic, but I believe this principle has helped me to achieve more consistent and consistently enjoyable play, with top-quality people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266363/#Comment_266363" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T13:39:43+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  1:39PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>For example, early on in our 4E campaign, I wasn't sure if I liked the speed of character development.

We frequently change stuff, but we discuss what we're changing and why, and sometimes that discussion ends up with us deciding not to change anything after all.

It's in concert with a lot of other memes, memes propagated by rulebooks, mind you, that it often becomes dysfunctional in my (our) experience.<br/><br/>Vernon hits the nail on the head when he mentions the original idea of GM as referee.  This relates to what I was saying earlier about the initial slippage from mission-based tactical skirmish play towards more "story-oriented" play and using old tools to do new things.  If the group's goal is to tell a story together, it doesn't really make a lot of sense to make one player primarily responsible for that story.  But that's what was done, because it seemed like the correct intuitive leap to make in the evolution of game design.<br/><br/>Another thing that the second wave of design did was to de-emphasize player skill, attack min-maxing, and encourage groups not to look up rules during session as a means of maximizing immersion or suspension of disbelief or what have you.  (I was pleasant surprised when talking to the OSR guys about the importance of player skill, the idea that it should be rewarded and emphasized.  It's not perhaps the same kind of skill as one can have at playing, say, BW, or even 4E for that matter, but there is a real love for it in the old-school that is not present in the "trad" school.)<br/><br/>In other words, the Golden Rule alone may be fine (though I do maintain that is not an inherent part of the hobby and is a definitive signpost of one particular tradition, that which is known around here as "trad").  However, anti-page-flipping + GM-as-auteur + GM-as-god + player-skill-at-manipulating-the-system-is-bad + Golden Rule = badness, IME.  Even two or three out of those five ingredients is enough for badness, in fact, and those ingredients aren't exactly rare among people whose seminal game texts include, for example, Vampire.<br/><br/>ETA: Specifically, what I mean by "badness," I guess, in relation to Jesse's comments, is that a group operating under such assumptions as I outline in the paragraph above is unlikely to ever climb the learning curve of the particular game in question\u2014even when that learning curve isn't actually very steep or long!  I saw that when I tried to play DRYH with a very traditional-minded GM\u2014it sucked!  But DRYH isn't an especially complex game, it just requires that you engage with it on its own terms.  When I tried to GM it I found it really easy to make it work just by doing what the book says to do!<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>There's a thin but very important line between, "The RAW doesn't cover this" and "I'm going to fudge dice results now."  I've had some productive discussions with Rob Donoghue about this, who is about a generation older than me and perhaps not coincidentally on the other side of the Golden Rule divide.  Before you have things like universal conflict resolution, yeah, GMs would have to make up mechanics on the fly to handle situations not explicitly anticipated by the rules.  "OK, uh, Jimmy make a Craftsman check, DC 12, Sally make a Riding check, DC 16..."<br/><br/>But that's very different than, "Shit, I don't want my players to defeat the bad guy this easily, I'm going to ignore that successful roll the fighter just made to hit him."<br/><br/>On paper, the divide looks obvious.  But in play, with GMs schooled in the idea of "their" story, the two techniques are often conflated.  What's worse, they may not even use the first one honestly.  For instance, they may not have anything in mind if Jimmy fails the Craftsman check.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266371/#Comment_266371" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T13:57:47+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  1:57PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "The GM is God" doesn't just come from bad 14 year old GMs. I spent many miserable years trying to share my Authority with groups who *refused* to take any of it but were more than happy to try to undermine it at every turn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266372/#Comment_266372" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T14:00:36+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  2:00PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>If the group's goal is to tell a story together, it doesn't really make a lot of sense to make one player primarily responsible for that story.</blockquote>\nI don't agree. See Choose Your Own Adventure books and interactive fiction, the solo cousins of story games. Storytelling, culturally, occurs in one voice, even if it is about many different fictional characters.  Collaborative novels are very rare.  Go to a local storyteller's festival and see what you find! (No, really, go, it will help your gaming. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>However, contrast that to films (is the director the storyteller? The screenwriter? The actors?) and RPGs nearest artistic siblings, the radio drama (I'm pretty sure the scriptwriter is the storyteller here, but maybe not, said Jack Benny).  So there are definitely different approaches that are valid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266374/#Comment_266374" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T14:02:40+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  2:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Like I say, communication is key.

I can consent to the latter without needing to know the former.<br/><br/>There's also an interesting point here about the importance of non-numerical rules\u2014I've had some great discussions with Jenskot about this.  Why would some monster choices be "very, very, very, bad"?  Well, one possible reason is because those monsters would be way too powerful for the group to handle.  But the thing is, a GM who put such a thing in the game is pretty clearly violating some non-numerical, purely textual rules about how to handle encounter design.<br/><br/>I think it's one of the insidious problems with Golden-Rule-ful play that, if the numerical rules don't matter, or, in the more generous interpretation, are open to being changed, then so too with the non-numerical rules\u2014even if the latter are in fact more important to the tone and style of the game!<br/><br/>Imagine playing Steal Away Jordan ignoring the rule about having a lines-and-veils discussion.  It could be really, horribly bad and dysfunctional very easily!<br/><br/>Ooh, here's another example: I met a guy on the Riddle of Steel forums awhile back whose group had tried BW and had a disastrous time with it.  Thing is, when I talked to him about it in a bit more details, it turns out that they had been using the Duel of Wits as "mind control" and had a player who was using his character's superior social skills to domineer the game\u2014things that are *clearly* against the rules, even if they don't have numbers attached to them.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266375/#Comment_266375" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T14:06:08+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  2:06PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>"The GM is God" doesn't just come from bad 14 year old GMs. I spent many miserable years trying to share my Authority with groups who *refused* to take any of it but were more than happy to try to undermine it at every turn.</blockquote>\nInteresting--do you mind going into a bit more detail about this?<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266376/#Comment_266376" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T14:06:22+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  2:06PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Content's not the same as rules, JD.

Consenting to the d20 rules system (for example) doesn't just mean you consent to having a number on your sheet that says "hit points" next to it, it means you consent that that number reflects how close you are to not being able to fight, a completely in-fiction piece of content.  "Strength 12" is content.  "Use Rope +3" is content.  System matters, at least that much.<br/><br/>No, I don't think the language of consent really gets us anywhere.  Very little any other player comes up with in a normal game session can really be said to be "consented" to, no matter what the game is. Instead, what we say is proposed for collaboration, with players having varying degrees of authority to force (within the boundaries of the system) what they propose on each other.  In Primetime Adventures, the person who has the high card has a degree of authority over the fiction that others don't.  You don't "consent" to what they decide to say in any way, yet you still have some aesthetic judgment about whether what they say is good or not, and what they say might be great for the group or not so great, or terrible for the group, and there's various things various people can do about it, ranging from sitting there and muttering to suggesting something else to standing up and walking out. Replace "Primetime Adventures" with "Vampire", "the person who has the high card" with "the GM" and you have the same situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class=" p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p4">4</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11908%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11908%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The traditions of "trad" gaming - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content='The traditions of "trad" gaming - Page 3' itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="All I have to add to this thread is anecdote.

                   All I have to add to this thread is anecdote. I'm a bit of a statistical outlier, I suspect: I started GMing D&amp;D in 1980, at 16, with a group of friends who were all new to the activity. A couple of years later (after the end of school) I hooked up with a different crew, and GMed for them (and hung out and lived with them) for the next 20 years. <br/><br/>So I was never a tween gamer. I had a foot in the tail-end of hex-&amp;-chit, which led me to D&amp;D. I played one or two semi-obscure games almost exclusively throughout the 90s (not one prominent 90s game took my fancy). And most of my roleplaying experience is not of breadth but depth. You really get to understand what's going on in a game when you have a group like that. <br/><br/>And yet, I read many of these comments and nod along. I would only very reluctantly play in anybody else's game from 1980 to 2000. Because I was pretty convinced that only I could run a game the way it ought to be run. I could sit in on any game and see exactly what the GM was doing \u2013 what strings he was pulling, what fudges he was fudging \u2013 and 90% of the time it shit me to tears.<br/><br/>Social huddling was concomitant. With MY group I knew that MY decisions would be backed up and that MY way of playing was supported. This was also very exhausting.<br/><br/>Forge deconstruction said: there is no one way to run a game. This is danger <b>and</b> opportunity. First, relinquish your preconceived ideas about what roleplaying is. Then try to design games that exploit particular angles of play; that codify them and drive towards them using mechanics and setting.<br/><br/>I'll point to <i>Pendragon</i> as a game that actually did that, in a huge and rambling fashion, in the 80s.

These changes aren't happening randomly.  We're not showing up on Saturday, throwing some dice, and then saying "Oh, hey, let's revamp this whole fame system for no reason whatsoever."  We are playing the game, thinking about the experience we are having, and if it turns out that we're having a problem, we're looking for a solution to it.  If we determine that it's a rule that's at the root of our problem, that's when we're deciding what we're going to do about it -- whether that's as straightforward as changing the rule (which is not actually that straightforward, really), or adjusting how we're applying the rule, or reorganizing our play to make the rule less problematic, or even just straight up saying "This game sucks" and playing something else with our limited and highly valuable time.<br/><br/>I suspect one of the things that separates our viewpoints the most is that I really don't have anything invested in this as a big philosophical concept.  I'm not thinking of some hypothetical generic gaming group when these discussions come around: to me, it's always about what happens at the table, and more specifically, about what happens at the table I'm playing at.  We have all of these amazing resources and combined knowledge available to us, and I'm afraid I just can't accept any argument that begins with the assumption that we should never, ever use those resources or that knowledge.  I'll gladly agree that we should use our tools and make our decisions <i>responsibly</i>, with the understanding that our responsibility in this case is entirely to ourselves and not to anyone else.  The Big Picture for me is always going to be just our table, and isn't going to include you or yours.  The most I can do to meet you halfway is to assume that in your own group you're going to use whatever resources and tools you have to satisfy whatever your own particular needs are, and that your responsibility begins and ends with you (and not with me).<br/><br/>So maybe that's where the two of us can part ways amicably on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266396/#Comment_266396" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T14:56:20+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  2:56PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Do you *really* not see a fundamental social-contractual difference between "the GM can choose what monster to put in the room" and "a player can say that there are certain *types* of fictional content they're not comfortable with"?</blockquote>\nSure, but the difference isn't that I've consented to him putting a specific monster in the room and not consented to him putting a specific monster in the room who wants to rape my character.

I'm not talking about individual successful local instances of play.  I'm talking about ideas across multiple groups.<br/><br/>JD's personal activity of Vampire sounds pretty cool but it is not the product of the literal textual application of the processes laid out in the Vampire text.<br/><br/>If we put three groups in three different rooms and tell them to play Vampire we might see something like this:  <br/><br/>Group A might have all the characters act as a team working under a prince carrying out dangerous missions.  They roll dice A LOT utilizing the combat rules to the fullest.<br/><br/>Group B might have all the characters hanging out at a theater they own.  They're all friends but intersect with their personal lives a lot and seem to be focusing on the alienation of being a Vampire.  They almost never roll dice at all.<br/><br/>Group C might have all the characters being in the court of one prince but not necessarily friends.  They are vying for the attention of the prince.  They roll dice occasionally, mostly to resolve sharp moments of clashes but the social activity is clearly organized around pvp political maneuvering.<br/><br/>This is the question I'm interested in: Which group best exemplifies the activity described in the text of Vampire.  When someone walks into the room and asks me, "What does playing Vampire look like?" which group do I point to?  Who is most achieving the game in its ideal form?<br/><br/>The answer is none of them, or maybe all of them because Vampire does not describe a coherent unified activity.  All three of these groups have either added or subtracted HUGE, HUGE non-trivial systemic properties to form *their own local activity*.<br/><br/>I have no interest in putting that much work into a game.  I do not want to form my own local activity (obviously to *some* extent I do, but not THAT much) around a game.  I want to read the promise of a game, buy into that promise, and, when I follow the instructions, have the game deliver on that promise.  And when I meet strangers who are fans of the game and we both say, "We like game X" that we are both imagining roughly the exact same thing because the game is an organized, unified activity that produces more or less the same organized results BETWEEN groups.<br/><br/>And to be super clear: I'm not talking about the aesthetic content.  The aesthetic content may very WIDELY between groups.  I'm talking about the organization and flow of the activity.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266410/#Comment_266410" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T15:40:44+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  3:40PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2010 3:58PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over lunch, a thought occurred to me...so going all the way back to the original post:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Personally I think it'd be fun to compare/contrast what we feel are ingrained and assumed enough to be considered "traditions" from our various histories.</blockquote>\nI just realized that there was a pretty big tradition that was in effect when I started gaming (*cough*mumble*) years back that I broke with early, but seems to still exist out in the world.  (Even here!)<br/><br/>It was assumed that if, for example, you liked to play D&amp;D, then you would want to play D&amp;D if you had an opportunity to do so.  So when a gaming con came around, you'd register and show up and play in a bunch of D&amp;D games.  If the kid who sat two rows over in English class talked about starting a campaign, you'd ask to join.  If you were going off on some kind of overnight field trip and you just happened to have your rulebooks and dice along, you'd drum up a game with whoever was assigned to your cabin.  It was traditional:  you are a gamer, so you want to play this game.<br/><br/>...but at some point, I started making a distinction.  It wasn't so much the <i>game</i> that I liked, it was <i>gaming with my friends</i>.  Where the traditional hierarchy would've gone "gaming with friends is better than gaming with strangers, which is better than doing some other activity," I started thinking of it as "gaming with friends is better than doing some other activity with friends, which is better than doing some other activity alone, which is better than gaming with strangers."  And so I hopped right off the convention circuit, stopped asking to join the games of people I wasn't already friends with, and (most tellingly) stopped really caring about gaming as a big community.  Don't get me wrong, I like that there is a gaming community, because I like hearing what other people are doing and learning from their reported successes and failures.  I just don't expect or want to sit down and play with any of them, and ultimately I know that whatever they do has nothing at all to do with what I'm specifically interested in.  I care about gaming on a personal level, not a general or universal one.<br/><br/>Today, if my friends all moved away, I would pretty much stop gaming entirely until I'd gathered together a new circle of friends who were interested in gaming.<br/><br/>That tradition still seems to be around, though, seeing as there are still massively successful gaming conventions going on and still people who are excited to go to them, and people who still react passionately to the idea of a big gaming community and still people who will absolutely love jumping into a session of their favorite game no matter who else is playing.<br/><br/><br/>EDIT:  Whoa, crosspost synergy!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite> And when I meet strangers who are fans of the game and we both say, "We like game X" that we are both imagining roughly the exact same thing because the game is an organized, unified activity that produces more or less the same organized results BETWEEN groups.</blockquote>\nYeah, I don't really care about that at all.  I'm never going to look at groups A, B, and C and compare them; I'm just going to try to make whatever group my friends and I are in have the best goddamn time we can, because that's where the value is for me.  If you say "I like game X," I'm interested in hearing why you like it and what your game X was like (because I assume that it <i>will</i> be different from anyone else's), but that's just curiosity on my part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266411/#Comment_266411" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T15:48:28+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  3:48PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>In other news, I too have had games wrecked by the "authority?

The assumption was, you always made the best possible choice, made the most advantageous move, and always sought success for your character. To do otherwise was playing badly (and probably hurting the game for the other players, too).<br/><br/>The first time I played in a non-traditional mode (which was not a Forge-born indie game, btw) and I saw someone create a self-destructive character who made poor choices (supported and affirmed by the other players!), I was blown away.

I don't know that I'd call what you've identified the borders of "traditional" gaming, but there's definitely something there.  I always had characters that were jerkoffs and morons all the way back to red box D&amp;D, and Vampire virtually predicated the whole concept of the game on your character's system-enforced self-destructiveness, yet I've encountered a lot of people who insist that their characters are paragons of rational decisionmaking and every decision they make is absolutely optimal at all times, even when it's clear to everyone else at the table that they've just fallen down the stairs and landed on an old lady. It usually comes up in social roleplaying situations, or trying to tempt them with seduction or bribery or whatever semi-obvious mistake that their character might be motivated to make. They don't even concern themselves with whether their character would make a mistake, they just say they wouldn't, and that's that.<br/><br/>Actually people like this have a great time (my experience) with Dogs in the Vineyard, because they're absolutely willing to take the most horrendous consequences for enforcing their judgments on people, since they're one hundred percent sure that they're absolutely right in every way. They're the player that makes the GM and everyone else back down, or the resistance of the town causes a massive immolation.  They then say solemnly but with full conviction, "They brung it on themselves."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266420/#Comment_266420" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T16:24:05+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  4:24PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 9, 2010 4:29PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not saying my observation defines the borders of traditional gaming.

I started play in the mid-70's with a bunch of wargamers, and we did that sort of thing from get-go.  Low intelligence characters were expected to do stupid things occasionally, low wisdom characters were expected to do foolish things occasionally, and even among members of the same alignment, religious and national differences were played up as sources of tension.  Mind you, the typical group of players has enough raw tactical ability among them that they could get away with the occasional non-optimum play and still win their battle handily.  It tended to be more of a "problem" outside of combat, say when talking to powerful NPCs.

Sometimes I'll talk about changing up something -- like if I said, "hey, I'd like to lower ACs by one for all monsters, because the game's a bit whiffy" and either no one disagrees or no one cares.  But other times, I'll mention that I think we should make a change and I'll be surprised that people do care.  The XPx2 thing was one such thing, I couldn't imagine why people would want a slow leisurely tour through the thirty levels, but now I understand my friend's play priorities better and can make more informed decisions about the game as a result.\n<blockquote> A group where that kind of decision is trivial and of no consequence to them? (Come run something for my group, and you'll meet one!)</blockquote>\nI bet your group has sacred cows.  But how much of an asshole do I have to be to find them?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>if players have to consent to the content of the game.</blockquote>\nThey don't have to give prior consent to all the content of the game.  I hope that's not what you think I'm suggesting because THAT IS SILLY.<br/><br/>Put it this way: I seek consent when I want to use my DM powers to put something in the game that may be controversial to the play tradition that our table has evolved.  <br/><br/>Mostly, this is about tweaking the numerical part of the RAW -- doubling experience, docking monsters 1 point of AC, etc.  But sometimes it <i>is</i> about content. If a player originates some backstory that I want to run with, I always ask permission about that, and I check in while I'm running with it to make sure I'm not harshing the player's fun with my interpretation.  Like, one of our PCs was estranged from a big family that I made to cause all kinds of trouble in the setting -- Dad was a temple-sacker, Mom was planning to murder Dad and destroy an entire city for the greater glory of Asmodeus.  But I wanted to be sure I wasn't shitting all over my friend's creation, so I asked him if it was okay if we involved his family, and then I sequenced the game so we got little sniffs of these things during sessions, gradually revealing just what the elders were up to.  All along I did ongoing checks via email to make sure I was still respecting his vision.<br/><br/>Let's look at your what-monster-goes-in-the-room example.  D&amp;D grants the DM the right to populate the dungeon.  This is uncontroversial at our table, and I would suspect also across 99% of D&amp;D AP.  But D&amp;D also has rules about leveling challenges to the PCs.  I started our campaign by following these rules very tightly.  Our play suggested to me that we could modify these rules to offer more challenge to the PCs, so I did, after ensuring that everyone else felt like I did.<br/><br/>If I step outside the spirit of those rules -- like if I put together an encounter where I suspect that the game is underestimating the challenge level -- then I mention my misgivings before we begin proper play.  And if I eyeballed the session wrong and smoked the whole party, that's on me, and I'm open to any consensus that emerges as to how (or whether!) to continue the game.<br/><br/>I do this because I believe that our convention is that if there are minis on the table, the challenge is leveled according to the rules the players are accustomed to.  <br/><br/>(Alas, my players are much more capable that I am, and when I issue such warnings, my forces generally eat it raw.  *sigh*)<br/><br/>To come around to the original point of the thread: some of these traditions of play are nearly universal, and some are merely very prevalent.  Take, for instance, "the DM has the right to populate the dungeon."  That feels pretty universal to me.  If I came to AZ and ran some D&amp;D for your crew, I wouldn't bother to ask them if it was okay if I housed the dragons with the ogre magi.  They don't get input into that, not by the RAW, and not by universal tradition, and if they claimed the right to rearrange my monster condo, I'd say WTF?  And hopefully roll with it from there because maybe their style of play is awesome...<br/><br/>Or, say I decided that for your crew, I was going to run a game where no one ever received magic treasure.  That could be controversial idea.  It certainly has big play impacts, especially in 4E.  4E RAW clearly states that the DM has to award magic treasure on a tight schedule so that the party's capabilities evolve at the expected rate.  Maybe that matters to your guys, maybe that doesn't -- but I'd be an asshole to just assume it didn't.<br/><br/>Hell, another example: say I got down to AZ and discovered that your crew was entirely composed of Grognardia old-school-revolution types.  I'd probably feel  free to ignore any kind of challenge rules and sic a squadron of red dragons piloted by pit fiends on them at every turn.  They're old schoolers; they understand that their characters are food for my trough.<br/><br/>In summation: if I know what the universal traditions are, and what the local traditions are, and what is negotiable, and what is not, then I have a much better chance of contributing to fun for all.  Thus, this thread is very illuminating to me and is a good thing, and you shouldn't worry that it's going to destroy the hobby like the Forge nearly did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266450/#Comment_266450" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-09T20:59:31+00:00" title="April  9, 2010  8:59PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't worry, I never thought the Forge was that important. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266481/#Comment_266481" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-10T13:12:06+00:00" title="April 10, 2010  1:12PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2010 1:18PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This conversation has gone a long way since my last post, but I'd like to address what I was trying to say (maybe poorly): in this thread about "traditional play" and whether that can be said in a way that is in any way meaningful, why are people constantly defending their playstyle or trying to point out why another one is flawed? There seems to be a lot of defensiveness when the question, at its root, doesn't say anything about the quality or value of the gaming.<br/><br/>I am just interested in the identification of certain features of play that may or may not allow us to discuss a certain "tradition". For instance, the whole Golden Rule/Rule Zero thing may work really well at one end of the spectrum for a certain group and work much better at the other end of the spectrum for a different group. But, to those people who want to deny that when someone says "traditional gaming", they are in fact referring to anything that can be defined in some meaningful way, doesn't the existence of that spectrum suggest the term may mean something? That's what I'm asking.<br/><br/>I don't care which is more fun or more functional (although I know which I prefer). But if we've observed a variety of gamers playing with the presence of Rule Zero, and we can look at a variety of game texts that endorse its use, and then look at a population of gamers and texts that deny its utility, does that not point to at least one useful factor we can use to distinguish various "traditions" of gaming? Because that's interesting, I think, even though the lines will be blurry where they meet.<br/><br/>Speaking personally, if I sign up for a Vampire game, I'd go in prepared to see the GM changing rules on the fly without consulting the group. If I shot someone and the GM told me the bullets had no effect, I would try my best to enjoy that (it might be a cool plot point or something, right?). (I'd be prepared for that; I wouldn't be surprised if it WASN'T the case, either.) But if I sign up for a Dogs game and I see the GM saying the same thing, or Taking the Blow without taking Fallout, or maybe saying, "No, you can't escalating to Fighting against this woman, because she looks too helpless; you can't bring yourself to hurt her", I would be absolutely *shocked*. Those differing expectations suggest to me at least one useful distinction between traditions of gaming.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>"One thing to consider is to remember that games are fundamentally a social pastime, and for a group of people to engage in a game together, they must collectively decide to trust one another."<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>I really don't understand all this language about trust.  I don't put trust in the GM or worry about whether he or she is going to betray my trust.  I've had bad GMs and they were lame and it was annoying, but then we criticized them or stopped playing with them.  I get this undertone from text like yours and some of the language that emphasizes there was somehow this power imbalance between GMs and the rest of the group that there is a lot of emotional scars floating around from really bad group dynamics in the past.</blockquote>\nNo, I'm talking about a basic level of human relations. If Dave and Bob and Lucy call you up to a play a game, and you say "yes", you're entrusting them with a couple of hours of your life, or however you want to look at it, and you're expecting that their half of the bargain is to engage you in something fun. If the "game" involves throwing garbage at you and stealing your money, I'm sure you'd feel your trust was misplaced and feel like you'd been wronged. That's all I meant by that, although I'm not sure how clearly I'm expressing it even now.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>I think it's a notable factor that a group which places authority and trust in the hands of one member, who is then responsible for a large portion of the group's fun, is more likely to face interpersonal problems or social conflict when things go bad.</blockquote>\nHow does this follow?  If you look at organizational dynamics, it is often the groups built on the most democratic principles that tend to end up with the worst interpersonal problems.  Look at the failure of all the various social experiments in the '60s.<br/><br/>I could be entirely wrong about this. It's just a guess on my part. But I would imagine that, given these two scenarios:<br/><br/>1. Four friends decide to go out to dinner every Monday night. They decide to vote each week on which restaurant to visit.<br/>2. Four friends decide to go out to dinner every Monday night. They decide to let Bob pick a place each week; and if someone disagrees with that choice their options are to go along with it or leave the group. Bob's word is final.<br/><br/>I would imagine (again, just a guess on my part--what do you think?) that group 2 might be more likely to blame Bob and get into a fight if Bob consistently chooses restaurants that the other three friends don't like (e.g. one is a vegetarian, one hates Italian food, etc), whereas group 1 might be more likely to laugh it off and renegotiate next week.<br/><br/>But I'm just talking in terms of probabilities, right? For a group that just moved to a new city, having Bob (a local whose taste and judgement they trust) might be by far superior to voting amongst themselves in terms of finding good places to eat.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite><br/>JDCorley already made the distinction between The Golden Rule and Rule Zero.  What you are doing here is simply re-conflating them.  The whole point of the Golden Rule is that it is the group's responsibility to do what they want with the game.  At any given time, the GM may have a certain authority or deciding factor, but this is not necessarily so and not necessarily a function of the system being used.</blockquote>\nI must have missed that. No problem, let's say "Golden Rule" means "the group is not expecting to conform to the written rules, and can agree to change them" and Rule Zero is something like "the GM can change any rules at any time without group consent"--is that close enough?--my issue with the discussion is that some people (like Eero) seem to be trying to define the use of Rule Zero as a possible feature shared by a style of traditional play, whereas the responses denying that sound to me like people saying, "No, we always use the Golden Rule. How could you play without it?"<br/><br/>I'm very much not trying to conflate them--if you got that impression, it's probably just because I used the term "Golden Rule" in my post. I meant the "bad" version, like my version of Rule Zero, in the paragraph above. I''m, entirely contrary to that, trying to make sure that they are NOT conflated. From where I'm sitting, people like Eero are saying, "there's a tradition of gaming where Rule Zero is unacceptable", and people like JDCorley (sorry to use you two guys as examples!) are responding with, "No, you're wrong. Every group must use the Golden Rule, or they're crazy." <br/><br/>I'm trying to see if I'm misunderstanding what's being said--it sounds to me like the two sides of the debate are talking past each other, so I wanted to ask how the "traditional gaming doesn't exist" side of the argument sees the absence or presence of this Rule Zero. Why isn't it a meaningful distinction between gaming traditions? Is it an illusion? If so, how, why?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266482/#Comment_266482" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-10T13:22:11+00:00" title="April 10, 2010  1:22PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Johnzo, your summary and history of play rings very true to me.<br/><br/><b>In my experience</b>, if this statement is controversial at the table, it's a "traditional" game (regardless of when the game was designed or published):<br/><br/>"My character doesn't always make the best decisions."<br/><br/>In the traditional-style games I've played, that would be a crazy thing to say.

I started play in the mid-70's with a bunch of wargamers, and we did that sort of thing from get-go.  Low intelligence characters were expected to do stupid things occasionally, low wisdom characters were expected to do foolish things occasionally, and even among members of the same alignment, religious and national differences were played up as sources of tension.  Mind you, the typical group of players has enough raw tactical ability among them that they could get away with the occasional non-optimum play and still win their battle handily.  It tended to be more of a "problem" outside of combat, say when talking to powerful NPCs.  But the results of that were often fun, if you survived...<br/>I'm not old enough to have been playing games back then, but in my humble opinion, yes, that's how it worked during the very first days, in the 70's. Then during the 80's and 90's what John is describing happened, possibly because of the reasons Vernon posted way up on this page...<br/><br/>This is also why very "non-traditional" games, like the ones produced around here are often seen as both an antithesis to "trad games" and a callback to the old school at the same time.<br/><br/>Just how I see things from over here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266483/#Comment_266483" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-10T13:29:57+00:00" title="April 10, 2010  1:29PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>As I say, given the role of the GM as primary creator of much of the world/events in many games, I don't see how it could have been any other way.

It sounds like you've been saying gamers are picky about their experiences to the point that we frequently would need to modify games to have any hope of enjoying them. It's really hard to get a good sense of the overall hobby, but it seems to me that while this is a feature of at least some forms of traditional play, for my group and a non-trivial portion of gamers it's patently untrue. It's not "We absolutely must do what the designer says," so much as "We have no particular reason to change the rules." My tastes are broad enough that the majority of games don't rub me the wrong way rules-wise, so abandoning the rare titles that don't work for me isn't a big sacrifice or a suicide pact because chances are the next one will work just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266513/#Comment_266513" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-10T22:25:33+00:00" title="April 10, 2010 10:25PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking: Isn't your stance on the Golden Rule thing directly contrary to how gaming works outside the narrow band of traditional roleplaying, Jason?

As far as I'm concerned, roleplaying games are just games, and I treat them no different than Monopoly or Settlers of Catan. I don't try to change the rules half-way through the session, and I don't evaluate each application of the game's rules and procedures in the light of its consequences any more than I do with a boardgame. I might judge the game after play, and if I like it enough I might even fix it, but during play we follow the procedures indicated, just like in a boardgame.

That's not to say that I haven't seen it in videogaming environments. "Griefing" is a violation of this, often.  The participants have decided that a particular element of the game is not fun and mutually decided not to use it - it might be a glitch, a weapon or move considered "cheap", and so on. The person who does use it after this decision is considered destructive of the game.<br/><br/>Boardgaming is interesting. Most Golden Rul-ing I see in boardgaming takes place outside of actual play (didn't we just have a giant chess variant thread?), though I have seen it in long-form wargaming where waiting to fix a rule would be intolerable.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Trying to ignore the above as an accidental detail that is overshadowed by the different dice mechanics of Vampire and GURPS (two games that share a very similar approach to how a game text is used) seems incredible to me, but that seems to be your argument: these dissimilarities between traditional and alternative games and gaming attitudes do not signify real breaks in tradition because they're somehow shallow and incidental, no more important than the many different details among the tradition.</blockquote>\nWhoa.

Still, I'd love to hear about the differences between in-tradition games in more detail, because that seems to be a crux issue here. We've heard about the typical markers of tradition in this thread, things that separate traditional games from the alternative, ranging from the Golden Rule in its various forms to GM-auteurism to absolute character autonomy to illusionism to ROLEplaying and so on; it might be instructive to hear about what you think of as more important <i>differences</i>, Jason - you're saying that games within the tradition are so dissimilar that these similarities are insignificant in comparison, while my own experience is that the whole concept of tradition wouldn't even make any sense to me if the similarities were not overbearing. To my analytical understanding of roleplaying the many similarities within the tradition are fundamental and overbearing, and anything left over as differences between individual games is detail that hardly impacts the fundamentals of the actual play experience; the practical reactions people have exhibited to these game texts over time carry this out, as attitudes such as System Doesn't Matter couldn't even develop in an environment where individual games really carry meaningful differences between them. The '90s were a time of totalitarian discussion in roleplaying, and this was no coincidence: everybody and their brother thought it fit to presuppose that everybody plays in the same way they do and consider the same way of play the "real" roleplaying because the game texts they experienced carried this out: they were written to be intentionally vague on minor points, derisive of rules design and celebratory of GM autonomy and one-true-wayism. There are many differences among traditional games that are important if you've internalized the similarities, on this I agree; but saying that those differences are as important as the differences between the tradition and alternatives doesn't convince me yet.<br/><br/>It's cool if you don't want to go into this sort of detail, though - it seems nit-picky to me as well, and this thread is growing long in the tooth.

There pretty much isn't any such thing as functional gaming without Golden Rule as you're defining it, but I don't really see how a definition that says that *any* attempt to evaluate how the game works at all means you're using it is really useful. That I don't and can't live up to the platonic ideal of what the game designer intended is a given[1], as is thinking about how well the game is working, but in my mind that's a different matter from consciously changing the rules, on the fly or otherwise. I wouldn't say that I never do that under any circumstances--and I doubt Eero for example would say that either--but those tend to be rare edge cases rather than something my group does regularly and explicitly as part of our culture of play. If there's a value to talking about the Golden Rule in this discussion, to me it's in a way that shows a very marked contrast between RAW-oriented play and World of Darkness Golden Rule-oriented play.<br/><br/>[1]Though of course it's also a given that an RPG necessarily includes a measure of flexibility in its play as part of the designer's intended usage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266546/#Comment_266546" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T09:43:37+00:00" title="April 11, 2010  9:43AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2010 9:52AM by JDCorley.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>The '90s were a time of totalitarian discussion in roleplaying,</blockquote>\nActually, as I've pointed out before, the 90s were the first time that mass roleplaying discussion could actually occur on any kind of basis and if there's any possible word that is wronger to describe early mass roleplaying discussion than "totalitarian", I can't think of it.

To her, whatever the differences between those systems, they are insignificant, she might even say "oh, all those are games in the fantasy RPG tradition, I prefer alternative, better, non-brain damaging games"  While I, who have love in my heart for virtually all games, say, "How can you lump those together, dear heart?! They're very different!" and she yawns and reminds me to fix something around the house that needs fixing. This domestic drama plays itself out in many things she doesn't like.

Doesn't change the fact that I still recognize trad gamers for how they cheerily assume that all roleplaying fits within their parochial understanding of the form <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Or, to say the the same with more elaboration: totalizing discourse that strived to develop roleplaying by presenting the writer's own preferences as the ideal of the form was a matter of course for any abstract discussion of rpg technique in the '90s. The language of discourse was such that any development was presented not as a strain of thought as is typical today, but as a taxonomy of roleplaying evolution with the author's own style on the top. This is basically the complete meat and bones of what rpg discourse consisted of at the time: the idea of good playacting could only be developed in contrast to those wicked roll-players, for instance. The assumption was not that there are different types of roleplaying that fulfill different purposes, but that all roleplaying is the same thing in different degrees of purity, a thing that can be described as some sort of pyramid with the pure form stripped of its historical weight on top. That's what I call totalizing, even if no two writers could quite sing out of the same choir-book on the actual substance of this perfect roleplaying.<br/><br/>If I had to pick my favourite depiction of this approach to rpg theory in print, I'd have to go with <i>Tri-Stat</i> - the game's from the early '00s, but it does encapsulate so many things about the Zeitgeist that it's like a crystallization of the spirit of '92 in many ways. The absolute high point for me is the essay on advanced roleplaying, the one that describes the Golden Rule and the ladder of evolution of play, complete with rules variants suited for different levels of sophistication, on top of which the group discards the rules and realizes the perfect satori of freeform play.<br/><br/>Actually, that should be on the trad feature lists at the beginning of the thread: if somebody plays differently than I do, that's because they haven't progressed as far in developing their rpg skills as I have. Hierarchical instead of parallel understanding of roleplaying. Somebody said something like that already, in fact, now that I think about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266551/#Comment_266551" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T10:28:13+00:00" title="April 11, 2010 10:28AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're also probably correct about the subjective bias related to analysis of a game's internal structure - personal understanding and goals will play a part in what a person will choose to regard as significant. However, is that not sufficient for our purpose of affirming the existence of a tradition of roleplaying? If I'm seeing a heritage of traits that are crucial for my enjoyment of roleplaying whether in good or ill, and those traits really transmit coherently like a cultural tradition, then does it really matter that you don't find those traits important? They're important enough for me and some other guys for us to call that family resemblance between that set of games the "traditional gaming style". In what way is this wrong just because you don't place the same importance on those traits?<br/><br/>Looking at this by the way of simile: I think that the issue of Papal infallability is not very important for the cosmology of Christianity. Do you think that I should deny the existence of the Orthodox church because the most important difference between Orthodox and Catholic Christianity is one that I don't find very important? Surely that would be absurd; the best I can do is say that I don't care about the difference, but that does not do anything to prove that the difference does not exist. Similarly here the existence of the "trad gaming scene" is something that I understand you to be trying to disprove by showing us how the differences we're seeing between trad and non-trad games are inconsequential, imaginary or over-emphasized. It is not sufficient to say that you yourself don't find the traits that define trad gaming to be very important, you need to show that the traits don't exist or that they aren't transmitted culturally as a tradition, or in some other way pick apart the concept of gaming tradition. Your own indifference merely shows that you don't care about the difference between trad and alternative gaming, not that the difference does not exist.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>A few words more on the issue of whether the concept of trad gaming matters: the reason for why I find the concept of trad gaming to be more important than the concept of "fantasy gaming" in many situations is that trad has plenty of explanatory power in my understanding of how I play, what I enjoy and how games work. By understanding the unitary tradition of mainstream gaming I can not only choose to play according to it, but also to play differently - and what's more, I can also design using traditional or non-traditional tools in full cognizance of how and why different techniques have been used in game design. So that's why I place such comparative emphasis on the concept of the mainstream tradition vs. some other categorizations of games, such as fictional genre.<br/><br/>It is obvious that my historical understanding of games and gaming culture is also impacted heavily by my analytic understanding of the activity - and this understanding is, in turn, largely based on Big Model rpg theory. It would not be unfair to say that the concept of mainstream gaming tradition is useful in its current form for me partially because the traits described as "traditional" are ones that have great weight in the Big Model. So it's a worldview of sorts, one that has connections to different directions. I can see how trad isn't an useful concept for somebody who doesn't share my interest in hermeneutics of rpg texts, power relations of play, Creative Agenda analysis and other such matters that are very specifically determined by the mainstream tradition of gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266552/#Comment_266552" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T10:37:07+00:00" title="April 11, 2010 10:37AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2010 10:37AM by JDCorley.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>However, is that not sufficient for our purpose of affirming the existence of a tradition of roleplaying?</blockquote>\nOutside our own minds?

I don't think that I've accused trad gaming of bad design and brainwashing, myself; I've described my experiences with traditional games here, and the negative consequences the tradition has had on my gaming experience, but I haven't at least intended any greater condemnation like you suggest: insofar as I'm concerned, the tradition is a valuable thing full of many interesting works, althought I have to admit that many of those works only work for me as literature, and the entirety of what the Finnish roleplaying culture had to offer me in the early '90s was not sufficient in bringing me to consistently exciting play by itself. So while my own relationship to the tradition is ambivalent, I don't want to pronounce any general judgment on it. Who knows, perhaps the wheel turns around at some point and around 2020 we'll all be going back to traditional games in some sort of weird OSR repeat, gushing about the highly detailed settings, metaplot, multitudinous elaborate character niches, combination of story and party, auteuristic GMing and whatnot. If there is some structural theoretical reason for why this could never be once I'm in a new stage of life and need different things from my roleplaying, then I don't know about that yet.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, I think that the whole idea that indie gamers are somehow down on the tradition is your typical Internet exaggeration. Somebody somewhere said something, and then that becomes a cliche that only has a grain of truth to it. For instance, in this case I'm pretty sure that many of the particularly self-conscious and excited alternative gamers have an ambivalent relationship to traditional games like I do, but there's a long way from this personal experience to some dogmatic judgment against the tradition like Jason suggests. I can't of course speak for other people, but I myself see no contradiction in me not liking a type of gaming and somebody else enjoying it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266554/#Comment_266554" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T11:08:36+00:00" title="April 11, 2010 11:08AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess it just seems goofy to me to say "well, this experience I had was very very bad, but RPG authors have to be held to a different standard than me, when they talk about the experience they want their game to create, they must not under any circumstances say that other experiences are very very bad".

A radical movement in game design would not have been necessary were this not the case. Still, it's an informed opinion I hold, and one that's not supposed to be universal and prescriptive in the way of your average '90s rpg theory. The most I'll say is that there are games where designers have failed in accomplishing their design goals due to undue influence of ideas held normative in their design culture. This is a far cry from "every trad game is bad" or similar statements - and it's especially different from the very language of traditional gaming, the one we can witness to this day on many gaming forums, the language in which a conditional statement is often couched in absolute terms: "Roleplaying is about playing a role" or "A good adventure does not break the party" or any number of other claims the sort of which I've lost the taste for after getting out of the totalizing discussion trap; when I want to say that in this game for this purpose you do not want to break the party, that's what I say instead of putting the phrase "in roleplaying" in the beginning of the sentence. That's a rather clear difference between a vision of roleplaying where all games are one game with minor variations and one where you start with no assumptions when you approach a new game.<br/><br/>But be that as it may, this is just another case of comparing experiences: I say that traditional rpg discussion tends to be ridiculously one-eyed and often devolves into arguing about the true way, you say that your experience doesn't conform, and where does that leave us? If we had the same exact experiences, I doubt that our conclusions would differ that much, either. It's not that different from how the USSR is villain to some and hero to others, all depending on whether the State happened to pick the guy out of millions to receive a great opportunity, or whether he was one of those who got the boot, instead. I don't find it surprising at all that you want to defend your good experiences with traditional gaming; what I just don't understand is that you don't want to even recognize the existence of the tradition itself. I'm even open to the suggestion that I don't quite know the tradition in depth or understand it properly, or perhaps I misconstrue its seminal influences and where it exactly starts in history; it's just the very claim that there is no tradition at all that seems so arbitrarily hard to swallow for me, perhaps because I'm so used to interpreting cultural history as lineages of cultural transference, and not just in roleplaying.<br/><br/>Actually, a new question surfaces for me, once again: let's assume that there is a tradition of roleplaying, but it actually encompasses all Gygaxite roleplaying games ever anywhere - after all, we're all informed by D&amp;D, it's not that far-fetched to just deny the existence of radicalism just like Jason is doing. So given such a Great Tradition, Jason, what would you imagine a radical game to look like? That is, how much and in what direction would a game have to transgress from the Great Tradition of roleplaying for you to admit that it's a clear cultural break? It is apparently not enough for the designer to take a conscious step back into the basics here and restructure everything like Paul Czege did with MLwM - we've already established that it's not that different a game in your eyes - but perhaps there is some greater distance, a greater break to be made? How about forum fanfic roleplaying, is that culturally separate when we consider that the majority of the creators and players of the form have never even heard of D&amp;D? I'm interested in how you picture the limits and cultural transference of roleplaying ideas, considering your insistence that the lesser tradition we've sketched here is a false distinction, and actually all of the games traditional and alternative are more properly considered part of the same continuum.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266562/#Comment_266562" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T13:40:42+00:00" title="April 11, 2010  1:40PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2010 1:45PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>So given such a Great Tradition, Jason, what would you imagine a radical game to look like?</blockquote>\nGreat question.  I don't see the boundaries of roleplaying games as being well-defined, or even capable of being well-defined, as "games" is such a fuzzy word. I'm cool with that. This makes it very hard to say "X is a radical rethinking of roleplaying games" versus "X is not a roleplaying game".  I would say probably the biggest radical redesign of roleplaying games, that went right back to the root and went in a wholly different direction is World of Warcraft. I definitely see forum  and PBEM "simmers" and fanfic-RPers as being right there, especially Star Trek simmers, who have been doing their thing since the 80s via play-by-mail.  <br/><br/>Diplomacy!

They're wrangling with some kind of crazy and strictly theoretical discussion about how you'd classify games as part of "gaming traditions," with Eero (I'm guessing) taking the "doing this makes sense and is useful for a historical/scholarly analysis of what these games are and where they came from" side and JDCorley (again, I'm guessing) on the side of "in the real world the situation is too fuzzy to classify that neatly, and anyway the experiences and preferences of small groups are always going to take precedence when you're talking about an actual game."<br/><br/>I'm not sure either one is entirely wrong, although being about as disinterested in theory as it is possible to be (seriously, if it isn't directly applicable and helpful to my actual gaming experience, I just don't care), I'm not really in any position to follow whatever it is that Eero's talking about.  The smart money says they're both kinda right, just not interested in the same things.<br/><br/>If I'm totally wrong about either or both of their positions, well, I wouldn't be surprised.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266574/#Comment_266574" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-11T17:55:35+00:00" title="April 11, 2010  5:55PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I too have lost the energy to keep up.

I, for one, have gotten a lot out of this thread, in terms of thinking about the wide ranging hobby of gaming and understanding where certain "traditions" come from--some building on what came before, and some as reactions to what came before. If I've ever implied that I think certain styles of gaming were morally inferior to others, it was through some accident between me here at my keyboard and you there at yours. I'm fairly sure that if we were talking about this face to face, our disagreement would not be a major stumbling point (say, your real name isn't coincidentally the name of a major muscular fantasy film hero, is it, walkerp?).<br/><br/>Really the only thing I wanted to add was that I have seen a strong distinction of groups which make it a common feature of play (regardless of the game played) for the GM to change rules on the fly without the group's consent. If the term "consent" bothers you, consider "overt concensus", perhaps, as a substitute. Because the thing that made it notable for me was that many of those GMs would vehemently deny doing so in front of their players. The whole *point* was that it was done in secret, and that illusion had to be maintained (e.g. "You guys sure were lucky to make it out of that collapsing cave alive!"). I'm just talking about my gaming experience, here, not trying to lay down any kind of judgement. I've never, for instance, tried to change those groups' playstyle, and often enjoyed that kind of gaming, too. If a game is fun, it's fun, period, right? But it's interesting to me to see how different strains of gaming have evolved from the earliest days of wargaming until today. <br/><br/>It's a tangled mess, just like any other kind of human history. The difference, perhaps, is that the internet has made it possible for the last 15 years or so for people to get an idea of the breadth of the hobby and the differences between various groups' play, and that has led to some very interesting developments over the last decade, I think (from the Forge to the Old-School Renaissance to our good friend the RPGPundit).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266600/#Comment_266600" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T06:20:24+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  6:20AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of further immolation for all involved, let me just try to answer one question. If this doesn't make sense to Jason, I'll happily bow out.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Not the fact that the GM is using their authority to support the group's fun--that's undeniable--but that in this tradition of play the players agree by the mere fact of playing the game to allow the GM to change rules without their consent.  It seems to me that there is a tradition of roleplaying where this is not the case--I've seen it personally mainly in the indie scene and the old-school or wargame-ancestor scene, where the elements the GM has veto power over and which she doesn't are more clearly delineated.</blockquote>\nI absolutely deny that "consent" is in any way useful to talk about this. By playing a game, you don't "consent" to someone else's play in any meaningful way, no matter whether the game is D&amp;D or tic-tac-toe.  No, "consent" will get us nowhere in this, forever.<br/><br/>That out of the way, look at your two sentences. Doesn't the second prove the first wrong? Let me restate what you just said:  "There's a tradition of play defined by players who give one of the players authority by virtue of sitting down to play the game. As proof of this, I've participated in many games outside that tradition, in which one of the players was given authority by virtue of sitting down to play the game."<br/><br/>Perhaps I phrased it poorly, but I see a very strong distinction. There are things that exist in the rules which determine how we're going to interact at the table. If I sit down at a table to play D&amp;D with you, and you're GMing, we both know that you're going to decide what monsters go in the dungeon. If I start to argue with you about that ("No! It should be a bugbear in this room, not a skeleton"), it's very clear that I'm playing the game wrong. By knowing what D&amp;D is, I'm consenting to let you decide what the dungeon is like--that's what the GM's role is in D&amp;D. That's well defined. I'm not consenting to "a skeleton", I'm consenting to "let's play this game where Jason decides what monsters are in the dungeon". When I sit down to play D&amp;D, I know the GM will be doing this as we play.<br/><br/>However, where it gets tricky for me is that I've seen a "tradition" (or lineage, or play-style) where it is also considered par to the course for the GM to, for instance, fudge on dice rolls without telling the players. That tradition/meme/playstyle holds this to be some kind of fundamental GM function, which he or she may choose to apply to <i>any</i> RPG. Additionally, the GM is not supposed to/allowed to tell the players about it. What it means is that if I sit down to play a game with a GM who comes from this tradition/playstyle, I <i>do not know</i> whether this is something the GM will be doing in play or not. I can't look in the book to find out. In most cases (again, in my experience, and that extends well beyond the 9th grade, to GMs of various ages and experience levels in different countries) I cannot even ask the GM and receive an answer. <br/><br/>In the case of D&amp;D and monsters in the dungeon, I know exactly what to expect when I sit down to play. In the case of a vague Rule Zero, however, as I just described, I am sitting down to play and I don't know which to expect. The book doesn't tell me, the GM doesn't tell me. I have absolutely no idea: I'm simply expecting to sit and play and let the GM handle it. It's just presumed, expected, etc--not something open to negotiation. It's the GM's choice, and he/she doesn't need to share her decision with the players.<br/><br/>(I don't know if that helps explain my use of the word "consent" in this context. But I hope it does.)<br/><br/>Now, this isn't automatically non-functional. For many people, this is clearly fun. I've had lots of fun doing this, too, on both sides of the GM screen. But, to me, those two experiences of play, those two attitudes to playing a game, are <i>so different</i> that I can't imagine not drawing a distinction between the two. And I'd like to have some way of being able to discuss one versus the other.<br/><br/>I relate this not to argue with anyone, but to (hopefully) clarify my position. I can see how the term "traditional" is not a good one, and has perhaps grown to have enough emotional impact behind it to have become a bad term to use in polite conversation. But I'd like to be able to discuss that approach to playing games as a different "tradition" of play, because it's an important distinction to me. I'd like to be able to talk about it online, and I'd like to somehow be able to find out whether a group I'm invited to is playing under one set of assumptions of the other, as well as communicate clearly when I organize or write a game.

You're cool with the GM arbitrarily picking monsters for a dungeon and not running it past you, but if they fudge a die roll arbitrarily, they've done something without your consent. What if it's a roll on a wandering monster table?  "Bah, a 79? Who wants to fight another orc? Let's make that a 78, so they can fight a bugbear!"  The fictional content of the game the GM (in games with one) has total discretion over is so broad, that by the time you even get to die-fudging, or other symptoms of the Golden Rule, it's of relatively little importance.<br/><br/>The distinction of telling you everything versus not telling you everything is cool, but again, when a magician is performing a card trick, do you expect him to say "Okay, so here you think you're putting the card back in the deck randomly, but really..."  Everything you're getting from a GM in a game (or from fellow players in games without a GM) is made-up, every single thing. Do you ask a GM in Dogs in the Vineyard how he came up with this character's name? No? Then how do you know they weren't arbitrarily selected by some unfair means?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>But I'd like to be able to discuss that approach to playing games as a different "tradition" of play, because it's an important distinction to me.

It's not the "traditional" term that's the problem (exactly), it's that either the term denotes much more than people are saying (I had to house rule Primetime Adventures in my home group because it was a complete dismal failure with narration passing to the person with the high card, thus, Primetime Adventures is a traditional RPG) or much less (a jackass lied to my face in a With Great Power game about what level his aspect was at, thus, With Great Power is a traditional RPG).<br/><br/>Edit: Why not call traditional games "games without meaningful limitation on GM creative input"? Seems to cover the ground you want without falling down the stairs?  Definitely a lot of edge cases (is the Mastermind budget system in Spycraft a meaningful limitation?) but like I say, I'm cool with fuzzy definitions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266616/#Comment_266616" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T07:55:59+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  7:55AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, Paul T., that's me!  You still in the Big Apple?<br/><br/>I would like to throw in a couple of things to further muddy the pot.  The wide range of gamers and groups who would fall under this broad 'Trad' category are also evolving as well.<br/><br/>The first and major one (and I'm quite surprised that it hasn't been brought up here yet) is that Rule Zero took a major beating with 3rd edition D&amp;D and is at least in terms of explicit rules in the grave with 4e.  One of the major shifts in 3rd edition was the addition of the the idea that the players could and should know the rules as well as the GM and that those rules should be applied consistently across groups.  Gamers brought up on 3.5 are much less prone to simply accept arbitrary rulings from the GM and will almost certainly be alarmed by any major deviations from the rules.<br/><br/>So your example of going to a Vampire con game and not being surprised if the GM just starts changing the rules seems unrealistic to me.  I think if that happened, there would at least be some grumbling if not outright questioning at the table.<br/><br/>I would say that Rule Zero exists today mainly as a mechanism to keep the game moving forward.  In our group, we only defer to the GM in the heat of the game simply because we don't want to get bogged down in rules discussion during the session. So the GM makes a decision and we table it until after the game, where it totally is open to discussion and negotiation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266622/#Comment_266622" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T08:19:32+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  8:19AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason:<br/><br/>In Game "A", the CourseMaster makes an obstacle course. It is designed and laid out. Then competitors come in and see if they can run through the course in under the predetermined "par" time. Those who do get a gold star. Those who do not get a pat on the back. The CourseMaster, using his years of experience in laying our courses, can pick from a wide array of obstacles, layouts, and set a par time that allows roughly 20% of all competitors to earn a gold star.<br/><br/>In Game "B", the CourseMaster has a console that allows him to adjust the obstacle course on the fly. If he sees a competitor struggling to get over the low wall, then the high wall later on down the course becomes lower with a push of the button. The finish line can be moved forward or back. Invisible pusher robots can help speed your time by pushing you down the stairs. The CourseMaster makes adjustments, striving for everyone who runs through the course to get a gold star.<br/><br/>Paul is saying "I see a tradition of CourseMasters playing game B while maintaining the pretense that the game is actually game A."<br/>You are saying "CourseMasters can choose any obstacles and layout they choose, so they are actually the same game."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266625/#Comment_266625" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T08:39:37+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  8:39AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 8:44AM by JDCorley.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thought experiment. I would say they are not the same game, but not because of the in-the-moment decisionmaking, but because of the 20%-finishing versus everyone-finishing goal. If you want to say "traditional gaming is gaming in which the GM strives to keep all characters alive throughout the game", that's okay by me, but seems counter to many experiences? I know my late-80s D&amp;D play had no such goal, which would make it non-traditional?<br/><br/>Edit: Or are you saying "traditional gaming is gaming where the players can lie to each other"? That's an interesting one too, I'd have to think about that some more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p4" rel="next">4</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p4" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11908%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11908%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The traditions of "trad" gaming - Page 4 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p4" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content='The traditions of "trad" gaming - Page 4' itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p4" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="It's funny.

Also, players hate losing. So it is natural to want to give them the experience of being winner-is-you-type-people. So some people play Game "B" while maintaining an illusion that it is really Game "A".<br/><br/>Some of game "D" leaks into game "B" play, because people are human. And also because the game was often played with immature and/or socially maladjusted CourseMasters. So there was quite a lot of Game "D" going on. My groups at home didn't swing strongly that way, but I ran across it at conventions. More often than I wanted to.<br/><br/>There are some good reasons to allow the CourseMaster to make on-the-fly adjustments. Others will argue that it robs them of a sense of accomplishment or verisimilitude. Or that because Game "D" depends upon on-the-fly adjustment, CourseMasters should be denied that power, and so kill the possibility of Game "D."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266638/#Comment_266638" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T09:47:56+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  9:47AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 10:04AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            walkerp,<br/><br/>Cool! I suspected as much, due to your cool avatar/picture, but wasn't sure. I'm in Toronto now, as of last Fall. Nice to put a face to a... cartoon face. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Know any fun gamers in Toronto?<br/><br/>Jason and walkerp,<br/><br/>I think we're on the same page now. Budgets for GM obstacles, Challenge Ratings in D&amp;D and similar things, when used, bring the game into a more ambiguous zone. Depending on how it`s played, something like D&amp;D 4E could be used within either "tradition". (However, notice how there are many roleplaying gamers out in the wilds who vehemently object to those aspects of the new D&amp;D. They are the most "traditional" ones, I'd say, in that sense--whether it's for valid and good reasons or out of boorish conservatism.)<br/><br/>And that's sort of the point: it's about how the players view the game and the hobby more than about what's in the book. "Traditional gaming is gaming where the players can lie to each other" is closer to it, though I would rephrase it more generously as something like, "traditional gaming is gaming where the players have more fun when they can lie to each other and not have it called out."<br/><br/>Like many other things, it makes more sense to me to speak of the people playing than of the game text itself. What's really important is how the game is played, and that's where the "tradition" thing comes in: groups of people can develop common methods to approaching and playing games.<br/><br/>It doesn't make sense to me to say, "we house ruled Primetime Adventures, so it's a traditional game". First of all, house ruling is not the issue--<i>how</i>the house ruling takes place is the issue. In the context of this discussion, "Guys, let's take out this high card narration thing" is not "traditional", whereas the GM deciding from time to time to give the narration to the high card player and deciding at other times to narrate him/herself or designate a totally different player would be a more "traditional" mode of approaching that game. Second, the house ruling tells us something about the group (although nothing terribly unusual), and nothing about the game itself.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The fictional content of the game the GM (in games with one) has total discretion over is so broad, that by the time you even get to die-fudging, or other symptoms of the Golden Rule, it's of relatively little importance.<br/><br/>The distinction of telling you everything versus not telling you everything is cool, but again, when a magician is performing a card trick, do you expect him to say "Okay, so here you think you're putting the card back in the deck randomly, but really..."</blockquote>\nThis is the point, right here--the point I'm trying to make. The "traditional" way (again, given that we're using the term in this thread to talk about a particular culture of play) is to see the GM as a magician working his or her magic on the group--there's an illusion, a trick, a deception in play that creates a form of fun and excitement for the players. The other way is refute that image and to treat a GM as another player fulfilling specific responsibilities (like stocking the dungeon).<br/><br/>I'm not saying one is better or worse--but they look very different to me, especially in the reality of sitting down at a table with people. (I've recently encountered numerous shocking and/or surprising instances of this in action, so it's very fresh in my mind.)<br/><br/>Your point about a GM having discretion over so much of the fiction is probably key: that being a vital part of most of the earliest RPGs probably points to source of this "tradition". I doubt we'd have this attitude if instead of D&amp;D, our hobby had evolved from "Happy Birthday, Robot!"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite><br/>So your example of going to a Vampire con game and not being surprised if the GM just starts changing the rules seems unrealistic to me.  I think if that happened, there would at least be some grumbling if not outright questioning at the table.<br/></blockquote>\nHere's where I see it in action! Remember how I said that when I sit down at this hypothetical Vampire game, I don't know how it's going to go down? First of all, I was thinking of a regular, private game, not a con game. But there's a reason the con game would get a different treatment: you've got a bunch of people from different backgrounds, all coming from different "traditions" of play. Given that, there's a high chance that one of them would be "grumbling or outright questioning" at the table. However, in my experience, there would also generally be a number of players who do come from this "traditional" mode of play and would be ready (and probably excited!) to accept the GM's ruling. They're looking for what cool thing the GM is going to do, and what magic they're going to work with it.<br/><br/>In that mode of play, the game is as much--or more--about exploring the GM's psyche, imagination, and storytelling skills as it is about exploring the system or interacting as a group of creative collaborators. (Those are two very different ways to see gaming, as a hobby, as an activity, as a culture. And they interfere with each other at some points, so it can useful and important to recognize that distinction and be able to verbalize it, I think.)<br/><br/>Again: I didn't say anything about quality in that last sentence (before the parentheses). But I have observed, in my personal experience, a whole tradition of gamers who believe that view of gaming (the GM as a auteur-magician) to be the sum total and definition of a roleplaying experience and approach every game and every game session in that spirit. I believe Eero is it least partially correct in saying that many of the more popular 90's game texts seem to support or reflect this attitude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266641/#Comment_266641" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T10:00:31+00:00" title="April 12, 2010 10:00AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 10:05AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>duplicate post... deleted</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266652/#Comment_266652" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T10:49:30+00:00" title="April 12, 2010 10:49AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/><br/>Here's where I see it in action!

I get the feeling you aren't really believing what I`m saying when I tell you that most gamers are not comfortable with the GM monkeying with the rules on the fly.  The only time that would be acceptable would be in a case of an unclear rule and priority being given to the game continuing to move forward.  Otherwise, if a GM suddenly starts switching rules or makes a mistake it is quite common for a player to call him or her out for it.  In our Deadlands Reloaded campaign, the GM was giving bonuses for flanking consecutively instead of just giving every flanking attacker the same bonus.  I called him on it.  He disagreed.  After the game, we looked up the rule and I was right.  From now on, we do it correctly.  Perfectly normal exchange and probably happens every couple of sessions or so.  <br/><br/>I do know of one group that has been playing The Fantasy Trip for over a decade here and they play it in the style you consider traditional, with everything basically being in the GMs hands.  He doesn't railroad and often lets the dice decide, but he is constantly making up rules on the fly and sort of estimating results and things like that.  His players quite enjoy it, but I know that for myself and many others in the community here, that game is to be avoided.  Yet most of us consider ourselves to be in the more traditional GM-led camp.  That game is considered to be really old school, almost an atavistic throwback to the old days.<br/><br/>This is where the silos come from.  I feel like you and others keep painting trad with this same brush that the GM can just do anything and that really, really, really isn't the case.  Again, there is a wide range, but I would argue that most groups that you call trad would today have a serious problem with their GM changing the rules of the game without first consulting with the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266708/#Comment_266708" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T13:02:58+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  1:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you there. Absolutely. Although when say things like "most", we're just comparing our experiences as gamers. I've seen lots of groups do what I'm describing, and I've also seen many play the way you're describing. Both are "trad" according to the way many people use that word. But they are very different (as you seem to acknowledge by saying that "for myself and many others [...] that game is to be avoided".<br/><br/>My argument here isn't that all traditional gaming is in that vein. I'm just trying to contribute to the argument that's been made that there are different traditions of gaming, and while they overlap significantly, they have some recognizable features. I think the word "traditional" itself is problematic, which is why I've been putting it in scare quotes this whole time.<br/><br/>But I do believe that those different playstyles exist, and to me it makes sense to consider them part of different gaming traditions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266745/#Comment_266745" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T14:28:07+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  2:28PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            walkerp, I have to say I find this distinction fairly problematic as well:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>You're really muddying up the distinction between a GM's control over the game world and their control over the rules and I think it is there that you do a disservice to the people you are talking about.

Adding an extra 20 hp to a bad guy behind the screen because he would otherwise go down too easy is changing the rules of d20, and sits in that hazy space where "well, this guy is very tough/narratively significant, so a battle with him should be more drawn out/emphasized/dangerous".  It changes the rules but it also is directly related to the content of the game. I suggest that's really where most GM adaptation goes, right into that hazy zone.  However, I do agree you're getting at something.  If I suddenly said "well, this guy is immune to critical hits", I think I would feel that it was much different than an extra 20 hit points, much more significant.  But is this only a matter of degree, or is it a matter of kind?  Is my feeling that one is okay and the other isn't justified?  Would it be justified in some groups and not justified in others and how does each group reach that conclusion? Probably a discussion for another thread and another time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266792/#Comment_266792" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T17:23:41+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  5:23PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the GM and players sit down and discuss what they want to do, and everyone agrees on a game contract where the GM is allowed to fudge die rolls at whim and change creature stats and world details when he thinks they will improve the game, but any rules changes need to be discussed and approved by the group, is that an example of a group playing in trad style (because the outcome seems to be a rough consensus of what "trad" means) or an example of a group playing in indie style (because the decisions about who controls what have been made explicitly and consciously and with the informed consent of all players)?<br/><br/>The basic question is whether the distinction between trad and indie is a matter of *intent* or of *result*.  <br/><br/>I happen to think that the principal difference between the two is one of intent and of self-awareness.

For a casual con game, I typically play fast and loose with the rules/setup. i.e. in a d20 game, I don't allocate every skill point to every NPC, in a GURPS game I always use a truncated skill list, in Primetime Adventures I often bring a pitch element or two to the table to help get things moving. If I'm interested in demo-ing a rules set, I stick closely to the rules, but not to continuity. Often times I'll say something like, "And that attack would kill you. So let's step back a few steps and see what would happen if things went different, remember when you rolled that 15? So this time you rolled a 7." and go from there.  If I'm demo-ing a setting, I do a similar thing except with the word "meanwhile" or "elsewhere".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>These two things are always and forever completely and 100% totally different and totally distinguishable from one another.

Wow, I think there's a whoooole lot of different things going on here that dance on both sides of the line. And from a player experience perspective, there's absolutely no difference in any of the above scenarios, they all involve the GM rolling 8 dice without explaining why or seeking any kind of permission from anyone to make it 8.  Similarly, if I decide in the moment to give an NPC 50 more hit points, from a player experience perspective, the time that I made that decision is completely irrelevant. There really is no difference between fudging in the moment and designing in advance from the perspective of the rest of the group.  <br/><br/>And there's nothing magic about rolling the dice that changes the situation.  If there's a 100-entry random monster table, and I like 99 entries, and I ignore the result anytime the 100th comes up, am I really creating some kind of deceptive illusion when I roll those two d10s behind the screen? No, I just don't like entry 82, it is the worst entry and would destroy the game.  <br/><br/>I agree with you intent is very interesting and a good way to divvy up these things, but even talking about intent, there's a lot of different things going on here. In some cases I'm looking into the world and trying to decide what makes sense. In some cases I'm planning out an NPC's capabilities as part of a cohesive whole character. In some cases I'm scrambling and improvising.  In some cases I'm thinking about what the group will enjoy most.  In some cases I'm thinking about story progress.  This isn't all the same thing.  What might be a good idea in some cases might be a bad idea in others.  And let's not pretend that GM intent is the controlling factor in play experience (this is the fundamental assumption of GDS theory.) I've just conclusively shown it's not at all.  It's relevant to discussing GM decisionmaking, and that could be a really good discussion, but from the perspective of everyone else at the table, none of the intent changes I've described above makes any difference whatsoever to play experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266817/#Comment_266817" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T21:28:56+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  9:28PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 9:32PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The rulebook doesn't say a lot about NPC stats, but making them up is entirely in the realm of the GM in terms of NPC effectiveness.<br/>[...]<br/>Really?

I don't see what makes it an edge case. The game (both in its textual form, and in terms of how the group is expecting to play it) has very overtly and explicitly given the GM that authority. If I'm playing, I'm expecting him/her to do that.<br/><br/>Whether the GM will fudge on the dice, though (for example)? I have no idea.

We had 25 minutes to play Tales of the Arabian Nights. I arbitrarily (as I knew the rules best), threw out the quest and scoring system so we could just go through a few adventures and mishaps. That worked out fine. It would work even further to just use the encounter deck and screw the game board. Depending on what you want out of the game, that's fine. However, if you play Tales of the Arabian Nights rules as written, it's perfectly fun and you get some strategy mixed in with it as well. So really, there's nothing wrong with implementing rule zero, and it's not something that's unique to RPGs. What's unique to RPGs is that a significant number of RPG rulebooks explicitly state rule zero. People will use it whether it's stated or not, why do RPGs need it to be stated explicitly when every other game type doesn't?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/daw65" title="daw65"><img alt="daw65" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/daw65">daw65</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266876/#Comment_266876" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T10:38:51+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 10:38AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>What my examples were trying to get at is that these two things are virtually identical.

I suppose that it's fine even if you decide retroactively that there should have been 8 dice, like so:  "I don't write down the NPC's stats and think he's normally pretty bad at figuring things out, so I decide the NPC should roll 4 dice, and I roll them, but just as they're coming to a stop I realize that in this particular situation his backstory dictates that he should have extra information about this thing he's trying to figure out, so I decide he should really have 8 dice, and I roll four more."<br/><br/>Here's a hypothetical situation where I think folks have trouble: "I write down a NPC in a White Wolf game, I assign him a total of 8 dice in figuring things out, which is good. When the time comes, I roll 8 dice.  The roll results in 4 successes, and the check required 5.  Failing the check sucks, so I decide that in spite of the roll failing the check, the NPC succeeds anyway."<br/><br/>I think there's an assumption that when a group goes to dice, the group agrees to abide by the results of the dice, or at the very least, will negotiate and implement an outcome that all will agree sufficiently abides by the results of the dice.  If that doesn't happen, then the dice roll becomes meaningless.  And for some, that threatens the integrity of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266959/#Comment_266959" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T14:31:57+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  2:31PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Whether the GM will fudge on the dice, though (for example)?

Still, a point of nitpicking here to demonstrate that you didn't actually change the rules to any great extent: what conflict narration is usually taken to mean is that the player in question determines what goes into the fiction, but does not necessarily narrate it himself; "the buck stops here" as it is usually phrased. So it's a technically valid play to ask another player to take care of it, even if not quite in the spirit of the thing. I seem to remember that the second edition text of the game says as much, too (unless it was the Finnish edition I'm remembering).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266988/#Comment_266988" name="Item_176" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T16:17:08+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  4:17PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2010 4:57PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>The person who still crosses their arms and says no at this point has decided not to play the game.

If that player had enjoyed narration/direction/having the final say and wanted to do it, there wouldn't have been a need to customize PTA. Remember, Rule Zero is all about the enjoyment of the group at play at the table, or murdering orphans, I can't remember which at this late date.<br/><br/>Edit: The interesting thing about PTA is that it's explicitly collaborative. In other words, if you (as producer or high card holder) make a decision I hate, I can try to convince you otherwise. That makes customization of outcome as group-oriented as it can be, and emphasizes the group vision of fun content rather than a GM's. This is very rare even among "non-trad" (cough, choke) games.  Of course, it also relies heavily on our social arrangements. If you and I don't have a relationship where I can convince you of anything, or where you feel compelled to do whatever I say, that skews outcomes. So pretty much any time someone in PTA with the right to decide (Producer, high card holder) says something you think is unbelievably awful, or just bad, or maybe not even bad, just wrong, and you speak up, you're experiencing Rule Zero in PTA. So unlike my Vampire "borderline" examples, since the responsibility in PTA is distributed, it stands to reason that the Rule Zero-osity is distributed too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267084/#Comment_267084" name="Item_181" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T08:27:24+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  8:27AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>That's interesting.

I think it is inherent in small group tabletop play and no game will ever function without it given the many varied groups and people in the world. It might work by chance in one particular group on one particular day with one particular situation, but that's rare. So you're right on target there.<br/><br/>b - I don't think "without discussion" is inherently part of it. In fact, the person who is given the greatest creative authority in Vampire (the GM), is explicitly instructed to talk about the game with the players and listen to what their preferences are.

Let me quote an authoritative source:\n<blockquote><cite>Emily Care Boss, "Key Concepts in Forge Theory," Playground Worlds</cite><br/>Rule Zero [is] the idea that if a rule in a game doesn't work for your individual play group, one should throw it out, replace it, or modify it. Called 'remodeling' the rules by Gary Gygax in the context of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, each play group was invited to work with the set of rules of a published game until they found a subset of rules that made it functional for that group. . . . Ron Edwards' 1999 essay _System Does Matter_ was in direct response to Rule Zero. In it Edwards posited that if rules needed to be dropped or modified that might be due to a conflict between the kind of play the game supported and what was desired by the players. Or were the rules functioning in the first place? These concepts formed a foundation for further analysis of the act of role-playing and critique of prevailing practice.</blockquote>\nSay what you will, but at least Forge theory gives you a place to stand. Talking about what is and isn't "Rule Zero" outside the context of the theory of play preferences built into the Big Model--or some minimal theory of "system," at least--won't get you anywhere, in my opinion. Because you have no rigorous basis for deciding what's the game-as-system versus the game-in-play. It's all special pleading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267133/#Comment_267133" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T12:09:59+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 12:09PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2010 12:10PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>To support my point, I illustrated a<b>third</b>choice, which was: be firm about the narration rule and ask the player to give it a try even though they might not like it.</blockquote>\nOh, sure, I can definitely keep on pushing what the player hates at the player and maybe they'll stop refusing and merely be miserable, or maybe they'll try it and find they love it, or maybe they are more patient than me, or the rest of the group, and will hold out until we all die of old age. (In my situation, the player had already tried it once (they had high card on a previous narration) and it was disastrous, their attempts were judged lame by the group, and nothing they wanted to happen was reincorporated by anyone else, they got no fan mail, and they themselves really thought they were brilliant and scintillating.)<br/><br/>So sure, there are three things to do when you see a problem:<br/><br/>1 - Fix it.

But that's true of any setup in which one player has more input into a game than another. That player's preferences are going to shape the game more. It's not unique to Rule Zero + a strong GM. Any game with a strong GM will have that trouble. Any game without a GM who nevertheless has a position that's uniquely powerful in terms of the fiction will have that trouble. Here I am thinking of the Investigator in Dirty Secrets. That player can change many, many things "to make things more fun", (of course, all actions taken are taken to make things more fun).  A strong Investigator can make for a strong game, a bad Investigator can make for a bad game.  <br/><br/>And even in very egalitarian, distributed games, isn't the amount of fun you have more dependent on the other players than on the game? I mean, isn't that just a basic truth of gaming, that a real person is far more compelling and important than a piece of paper?

But if it's a con, the GM or facilitator should definitely tell the players if there are any rules changes they're making. If they don't, it's really excruciatingly, unforgivably lame\u2014but I maintain is still based in both the texts and oral traditions of trad design.

I often use my social position as GM or host to force these changes. Players often give their consent, but I've tilted the balance in my favor and I feel I'm likely to get that consent.

I usually warn them at the beginning of the game that I am going to spring a surprise on them but I don't tell them what it is. This is totally dicking with them, with their partial consent. I feel it strengthens the experience of the game, especially in a demo, but I do this for full games, too.</blockquote>\nOhh, I've done a similar thing to this too. "There's something really cool coming up and I won't tell you what it is" is Salesmanship/Teaching 101. Great technique. Of course, you have to 1, get this idea across, and 2, deliver on it, sometimes one or both can be difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267340/#Comment_267340" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T12:38:51+00:00" title="April 15, 2010 12:38PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11607&amp;page=1#Item_25" rel="nofollow">this link</a>, Moreno put together a few quotes from different "trad" games which might be very enlightening on the subject of "Rule Zero".<br/><br/>Again, my objection to "Rule Zero" is not the formulation presented by some: "Change the rules if you don't like them." Like Moreno says, it's when that right is explicitly taken away from all but one person. <br/><br/>I can see Jason's point (in his reply): clearly, to him these texts read as a advice to do the former. But I'm pretty darned sure that many, many gamers have interpreted those texts as meaning the latter. And that's dangerous territory: all I was arguing in this thread is that there has existed a "tradition" of playing roleplaying games that is strongly based in that approach, and that this is quite distinct from groups and games who do not play this way (i.e. do NOT assume the limitation of Rule Zero to the GM, without room for communication or negotiation).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11908/the-traditions-of-trad-gaming/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11908%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11908%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
