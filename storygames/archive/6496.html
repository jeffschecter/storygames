You take two ingrediants and mix them together. Say you had some nice bread (not the white foam crap, real deli bread) and sardines.<br/><br/>Now, how do you mix them so one flavour doesn't overwhelm the other, and you have a nice blend?<br/><br/>Well, you just add a certain amount of each, and if one is too much, use less of it next time.<br/><br/>In relation to the other thread, I thought the competitive part and the thematic choices story part could be broken down into components. Like say the competitive side was broken into ten bits. Each bit is playable, but as you add more the competitive side gets more complex. It's a bit hard to explain, but if you've ever owned a board game and then bought an expansion, that's the idea. The competitive part would have say 1 to 10 parts, each a sort of expansion and making the competitive part bigger.<br/><br/>And same with the thematic choices story side of it - it'd be divided into 1 to 10 parts, each an expansion on the thematic choice game.<br/><br/>And then - the play group just tries out a combo, like comp5/story7* and see if it's a nice blend. If it isn't, try a different ratio of ingredients in the sandwich.<br/><br/>And that's my idea. Making the expansions wouldn't be easy, I'll grant, but I think it's quite doable with a bit of sweat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Tehe, it sounds like a D&amp;D character! I laugh cause I like that coincidence!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143915/#Comment_143915" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T07:42:56+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  7:42AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have a vision of what the components might be like.

The actual game of each isn't important to the idea, it's just that all components used woud add together to form a game. So if you used components 1 and 2, they'd form a different, larger game than if you just used component 1 alone.<br/><br/>Or in other words, I think if I get specific about what they may be like, you'll dismiss it based on perhaps not liking that particular game example. Like if I gave an example of modules 1, 2 and 3 that were all rather like monopoly, you might dismiss it because you don't like monopoly.<br/><br/>Take a game you actually like, and imagine stripping it back. If you did like monopoly - well, I imagine when you strip it back of alot of components, it'd look like a version of snakes and ladders. So component 1 would be snakes and ladders, while stage 10 would be complete monopoly. The stages in between would be various stages of stripped down monopoly. But as I said, take a game you actually like and strip it down that way.<br/><br/><br/>John: I think each component would provide currency for the other agendas components, so you don't just have two seperate games going one after the other. Though I think one after the other would be a worthwhile test as well. I'm thinking not vital currency, but such that it would effect the other components to a degree.\n<blockquote>Also, are many groups going to want to play enough games to get the balance just right?</blockquote>\nWell, that's an interesting question. I'm inclined to think a group who isn't interested in playing enough games to find El Dorado, aren't actually interested in finding El Dorado. Perhaps they just want to share some imagined idea of it, as a sort of simulationist excursion. Ie, instead of imagining an imaginary world, the simulationism is centered around imagining El Dorado roleplay. It'd be a shared imagined space about a shared imagined space! It'd be a bit self referential, but so is hackmaster. Or not.

You could vary the amount of currency granted. If Narr gives 4 Sim tokens per success but Sim gives 1 Narr token per success you'll spend more time on the Narr side of things, since it affects everything in the game more. Maybe that's an alternative to modular rule sets.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>Well, that's an interesting question.

Might be ok if you have a group of game designers but that implies once you have found El Dorado the game is complete. Well, the design game is complete and the activity becomes something different.<br/><br/>I think you can want El Dorado, but not want to search for it. Lazy maybe, but these are games and supposed to be fun.<br/><br/>John,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144151/#Comment_144151" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T07:57:02+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  7:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 7:58AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, I think I get it now. Basically "components" are rules, or sets of rules that deal with certain aspects of play, yes? Like the auction rules for Monopoly are one component that, in fact, many people who play the game do not use. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo I have it right? <br/>\n<br/>\nIf that's what you're talking about, then I think that what you'll get is play that's in one of two modes, depending on the preponderance of the rules selected, and how valuable the players find the components in question. That is, the game will be tailorable, but not transitional or neccessarily even hybrid. And that's if the players know what they're doing as far as creating an agenda. For most, in fact, I think you'd just get incoherence. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's gross conjecture. I think we'd have to see what it looks like before we could really guess as to it's success. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144310/#Comment_144310" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T17:14:30+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  5:14PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>I didn't suggest it as 'A game about designing games where you play a game', I suggested a <i>labour</i> of trying combinations of games, like making a sandwich is a labour. And I said some people might want to see that labour as an actual game in itself. And you've said you think this process is 'supposed' to be fun, explicitly indicating you want this exploration for El Dorado to be a game in itself.<br/><br/>That contradicts itself and you say as much yourself "Well, the design game is complete and the activity becomes something different.". In other words, if you found the design game fun, then when you find El Dorado that fun ends. This means overall, El Dorado results in LESS fun. And if your not aware of the contradiction, this just triggers the conclusion 'Well, if it results in less fun, then it musn't have been El Dorado!', prompting more exploration - which is 'supposed' to be fun, which will trigger the contradiction over and over and over again.<br/><br/>My suggestion is specifically for people who labour towards El Dorado, rather than want to play a game to get to a game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mike,<br/><br/>I don't understand what you mean by <i>creating</i> an agenda? Agenda's aren't created- if everyone likes wine, then you can have a wine drinking agenda. If half the people only like beer and not wine, your screwed - you can't make a wine drinking agenda. If everyone likes gamism, then you can have a gamist agenda. If half the people only like nar, your screwed.<br/><br/>A hybrid isn't made, it's a matter of whats there in terms of what people like. If the whole group is gung ho gamist, they will just go flat out gamist. A blend of nar and gamism would require a group of people who want a blend and yes, want about the same blend. Get one person in the group who wants flat out gamism and the group can't achieve that. A system can't make up for a lack of shared personal preference. What's blocking El Dorado here isn't system, it's people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
