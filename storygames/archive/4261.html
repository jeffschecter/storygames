The Deluxe Edition sports a stylish new cover (full color!), better layout for printing/binding, the original core rules, all of the offical optional rules, some fan-created optional rules (and die probability tables!), the Stage setting, and the old Character Menagerie once hosted at the MiM site. Basically, the Deluxe Edition is more of a full-on game that's ready to play out of the box. It's still free, to boot. And, yes, Scott was contacted (by me) and granted his permission for this 'new edition' of the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95778/#Comment_95778" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T22:59:12+00:00" title="September 13, 2007 10:59PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95852/#Comment_95852" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T07:32:30+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  7:32AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2007 7:32AM by Flynn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been a big Window fan for about 10 years, since Scott first put it online.

Once you've got an adjective, it should be a simple matter to decide which rung that ability falls into. Once you've got a rung, you've got a die.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: The Window</cite>The Window Competency Ladder<br/><br/>Incredible (D4)<br/>Very High (D6)<br/>High (D8)<br/>Above Average (D10)<br/>Average (D12)<br/>Below Average (D20)<br/>Low (D30)</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: The Window</cite>Royce Jenner has...<br/><br/>Below average strength.

(D12)</blockquote>\nSo what they mean when you say "Everything about a Window character is described with adjectives rather than numbers", is that everything is described as an adjective, then translated into a number so that the game system can actually work, then written down and never spoken about.  Well done.  I really need you to tell me that I was allowed to describe my character as being a "Strong powers of perception" because I have a high Notice skill.<br/><br/>Pillock.<br/><br/>Ah well, I guess for 1998 it was pretty original, but the tone was still a show stopper for me.

Indeed, both Fudge and Fate suffer from this exact same flaw, as do games such as Hero's Banner (though they're admittedly quite a bit more humble about it). Many more indie games fall into the general trap of "It's revolutionary!" while very few of them actually do anything truly original. The biggest flaw of the Window is, arguably, hubris.
