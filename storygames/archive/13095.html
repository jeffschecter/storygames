I have no idea what this costs to lease, what the contract lengths are, or if you need to put down a deposit. But this type of device (like a Xerox printer) likely needs frequent maintenance which would be covered in a lease by default.

Go work for a print shop or at least a copy shop for a few years and really get to understand the things. Then you'll be able to run an Espresso reliably \u2014 mostly because you'll know how to explain the problem to the Xerox dude on the phone.</p>\n<p>I was responsible for an wide format HP printer, a couple of black and white lasers, and a color Xerox for a while. Learning precisely what worked and what didn't was a laborious process, and our service contract was well exercised.</p>\n<p>Buying one of these things would be a little like finding that you can afford the sticker price of a Ferrari and not knowing that you'd void the car's warranty if you ever changed the oil to non-Ferrari oil.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295384/#Comment_295384" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T12:06:41+00:00" title="September 30, 2010 12:06PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2010 12:09PM by renatoram.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to underline that it's definitely NOT the price tag that should scare you... last year I went to the facility of one of the digial printers we've used for Janus, to pick up books after printing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chatted a bit with the guy there, and we were close to a pallet of stuff wrapped in plastic, taller than us (let's say 2m tall). He said those were the spare parts for the <i>next month</i> for their heavy duty laser printers! And it was all fricking expensive parts from (IIRC Xerox and a couple of other makers).<br/>\nGranted, that's also a scale thing: they have several machines, but hey...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, don't look at the price tag on the machine. Look at the Total Cost of Ownership (and operation) over a couple of years (better if you can plan for 5). Better yet, lease the beast, don't even consider buying it: in 3 years it will be a huge honking pile of garbage and if you bought it you get to keep it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
