They have courses ranging from painting, cooking, languages, sports, role-playing, theatre, survival, whatever. I think the American community centres is the closest parallel (I have never been to one, so I'm guessing here).<br/>This being in Denmark of course makes the activities free or almost free (government funded with small ekstra payment).<br/><br/>That said. I think it is awesome that the state (and parents) pay awesome roleplayers to play with the kids (and help them get started playing with each other).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kristoffer%20Apollo" title="Kristoffer Apollo"><img alt="Kristoffer Apollo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kristoffer%20Apollo">Kristoffer Apollo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320464/#Comment_320464" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T02:46:13+00:00" title="April 14, 2011  2:46AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2011 2:48AM by Kristoffer Apollo.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: IvanHo</cite>That said.

Go play with the teens once a week, get paid by the government, have more money for your studying years.<br/><br/>The most awesome Danish example of schools+roleplaying, though, is the boarding school <a href="http://osterskov.dk" rel="nofollow">\xd8sterskov Efterskole</a> - a type of in-between school where students board for a year between primary and high school. \xd8sterskov is run by gamers, and they use roleplaying and other games as an integrated part of all their teaching. Supported by government funding under the regular rules for this type of schools, and providing highly skilled new players for the roleplaying community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320521/#Comment_320521" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-14T10:11:26+00:00" title="April 14, 2011 10:11AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I worked as a teacher in Denmark from 1987-2002, and ran roleplaying classes for 5-6th graders (11/12-year-olds) most of that time, plus used roleplaying in for example history and social science lessons in 9th grade (15-year-olds). One event was a themed WW2 day where we played a Danish Fastaval scenario (Hindenburgh Auf) across a year group, where I and a couple of other pupils (who were active in our local roleplaying club) GM'ed the different groups.<br/><br/>I also had a few after-school roleplaying classes.<br/><br/>We also held parents' evenings explaining what roleplaying was, with actually demos with the parents, which worked fine. Parents are very capable roleplayers.<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
