I'm coming here as someone who is pretty new to tabletop RPGs, basically crushed out on story games, and I'm posting this as a long-time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSH" rel="nofollow">mush game</a> player. <br/><br/>On two days later this month, a small group of us, mush players into story games, is hosting a discussion about bringing together ideas of the new RPGs and mush games. <br/><br/><strong>Sunday, April 22nd, 12:00 PM PDT, at M*U*S*H: mush.pennmush.org 4201, page Ide for location</strong><br/><br/><strong>Wednesday, April 25th, 6 PM PDT, at at MPUG: puggy.mushpark.com 9033, <a href="/forums/profile/tel">@tel</a> to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23399&amp;Mode=like">#399</a>.</strong><br/><br/>A few of the ideas we'll discuss: GM-less games, narrative control, player ownership of the game world, scene framing, alternatives to xp systems, abstract resources, relationship and trust mechanics.<br/><br/>We'll start with a short informal presentation and then go to discussion. We want to consider carefully how these ideas can work in the large-scale online setting of a mush.

From talking to people like the owners of big mud portals, for example <a href="http://www.mudconnect.com" rel="nofollow">TMC</a>, activity at least as measured in overall hits and forum posts hasn't declined at all. However there is some other tangible evidence. Based on a few polls (which are hard to verify totally) new mush players (i.e. those who started playing in the last couple of years) make up about 10% of the total mush player population. Obviously this isn't good for keeping a hobby healthy.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I frequently see situations where a relatively new mush player will tell me they had no idea of the number of forums, resource sites, etc. that were available -- they only just played one or two games and that was it. This is like the silent majority effect -- again though, hard to verify.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63609/#Comment_63609" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T06:28:02+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  6:28AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, George, even when I MUSHed, it didn't seem there was ever much fresh blood coming in, which I think led to a lot of problems. The stagnant air sort of drove people crazy and made for some pretty toxic behaviour all around, which was what finally drove me off.

The need to constantly wait on Staff to actually do anything important.  It just made the pace slow to a crawl.  Want to affect anything in the setting or another character?  Got to have Staff approval.  Hope the appropriate one is online.<br/><br/>2.) Due to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, most scenes tended to be superfluous bar scenes where you just sat and gabbed in character. Boooooooooooooooring.<br/><br/>3.) Scene framing sucks in a MUSH.  Because they tend to be stuck on keeping the Mush on some realistic time system, you couldn't just skip all the boring crap and go straight to the heart of a scene/conflict.  You actually have to wait until the appropriate time to do what it is you want.  Unless, of course, you have Staff there to suspend the time rules.<br/><br/>4.) Asnynchronous play is hard.  You got a great scene you want to do but your necessary ally or your favorite rival isn't online.  Sit and wait.  Hope they aren't in a far away time zone.<br/><br/>5.) Social Contract stuff is really hard to nail down on a MUSH.  Most of a Staffer's job seems to be slapping someone player for stomping on some SC line that they probably didn't even know existed.<br/><br/>6.) I'm not even going to get into Creative Agenda problems.  The cries of "Twink!", "Powergamer!", "Wimp!" etc etc say enough about that.<br/><br/>I'd love to see a system that actually handled this stuff.  Most of the systems just shoehorn in Storyteller or D&amp;D or something else that really doesn't work all that well given the medium.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63805/#Comment_63805" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-13T10:55:18+00:00" title="April 13, 2007 10:55AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never MUSHed before, and I'm looking into it.

I was wondering how Engle Matrix Games might work in that environment?<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now we are doing a "Jack the Ripper: the game you play before the game" game on the MatrixGame2 yahoo group. There are six characters associated with the Ripper case (Jack, the Inspector, Lady Coverup, Lord Brutal, Mr Revenge and Pretty Nell). Unlike in a MUSH player don't pose. Instead each turn they write an action they want to have happen next. Actions are not just what their character does but what other characters do as well - so an action tells a whole scene. In the online game one extra player acts as referee. That person decides what has to be rolled for an action to happen. Other players can jump in with counter-arguments ("No that didn't happen - THIS is what happened.") These are resolved in a dice rolling competition. Successful actions/arguments are added to a list of game events. These form the verbal "matrix" of information of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers engage in discussions out side of arguments so it is very social. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn many ways these games sound like MUSHes only without the higherarchy of needing a system administrator to do anything or the need to use any special code. It's all done in English (or Spanish or whatever...)<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think that kind of game would be interesting to MUSH players?<br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle<br/>\nhamster@io.com                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64583/#Comment_64583" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-20T18:11:25+00:00" title="April 20, 2007  6:11PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main advantage of MU*s over PBEMS of the sort you describe is synchronicity - you play at the same time as others.

It's likely that sort of play would be seen as more akin to PBEMs than MU*s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see. The game I described above is by definition a PBEM (though our turn around time is several arguments a day.) The game is two weeks old and the MS word file I have it in is up to 67 pages. <br/>\n<br/>\nA few years ago Bryan Roberts ran a Super Hero game using the same rules done on a live journal (World of Titans). It was cool because players jumped in and spontaneously refereed and rolled for arguments. They were able to run through the WWII Battle of Britain (with superheroes) in a day or two. There were maybe 30 arguments. It felt like playing a face to face game. So I bet the technique could be used in an MU format. <br/>\n<br/>\nChris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64713/#Comment_64713" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T08:20:16+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  8:20AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In case anyone is interested, I'm setting up a MUSH game set in the world of Near using TSoY, of course.

It seems like I run in an entirely different MUSH circle and that the circles could benefit from cross-pollination.<br/><br/>Having done both PB e-mail for many years, and MUSH for many years, I find the synchronicity such a huge advantage to MUSH that I never looked back at e-mail or board-based writing.  E-mail now just seems too slow for me.<br/><br/>As to how we handle the issue of players making a difference on the world in my "home" on the net--  We have a very active staff group and there's almost always at least one staffer on that can answer an immediate question. Staffers have a different alt used only for staffing as well as their "IC" characters which are kept seperate. Staff is very approachable and there's much less downtime between an issue brought up by a player and a response from staff. If the issue is complex, we have a system called "Request" that allows you to queue a paragraph of questions for staff reply, usually a request for more information about a plot. Typically you get a response before the week is out even on complex requests; of course this is because our Headwiz is very invested in the game.<br/><br/>Scene framing is also rarely an issue. If we want to sit and gab, of course, we sit and gab, but so many of the games in  my circle have action or cartoon or fandom-based themes and follow the rules of fictional pacing rather than those of how reality is paced.<br/><br/>I won't deny that having slightly smaller games and communities may also facilitate better pacing and interplayer communication as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
