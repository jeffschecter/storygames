It's a piece of cake.  They're already there, looking to play something.  Most of them don't need any extra push.<br/>Pushes that did work:<br/>-Chance to win undisclosed prizes<br/>-That the game was free to play<br/>-That other people were already excited about it<br/>-Playing with the author of the game\n<blockquote>Does GoD anywhere else offer up stuff to players? <br/>Do you offset that with the cost of the tickets? <br/>Do the conventions you organize within offer up some kind of swag for gaming?</blockquote>\nFor the volunteers / GMs?  Not so.  They've already paid to be there, and there are a lot of other things to do at D*C<br/>Pushes that did work:<br/>-Trying out a playset you wrote on new players<br/>-Trading running a game for me so you could play in another game<br/>-Running a game you don't usually get to run<br/>-Shameless bribes\n<blockquote>I'm thinking, for next year, putting together about 4 designs, hopefully reflecting the "new hotness," and getting Chessex to custom cut me some d6.  At quantity, they are somewhere around $0.75 each.  I'd just replace the "1" side with [hand holding a gun as in Fiasco] or [MH logo] or [vampire bat sketch from Annalise] or [insert other instantly recognizable cool thing]  It's barely a step above a cool sticker or custom pin for your badge, but it's something.<br/><br/>Do any of you GoD veterans have advice on what to offer up?  I'm not in a position to sponsor badges, and in general, my volunteers don't want to put in an appreciable amount of hours at the booth.  It's more like a large quantity of "just a few hours here and there" volunteers.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389783/#Comment_389783" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T06:42:27+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  6:42AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the game designers, it was pretty straightforward.  Some people sent me games / postcards / coupons.  We played their games.\n<blockquote>Is this a thing people are interested in?  <br/>What if I was more mercenary about it... you help us cover our costs, and we'll run your games all weekend?<br/>You send us some postcards, and we'll promote your game for you?<br/>Is this a dead end?<br/></blockquote>\nAll of the character sheets I handed out, (even the ones we custom created for Fiasco) had the website of the game on them.  We're already directing people back to the sites, but I suppose we could do more.<br/><br/>It's just difficult without any (strictly gaming) vendors there (who carry these game books.)  I don't have the capitol to invest in a lot of copies of a game in advance, in order to sell them at the GoD booth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389784/#Comment_389784" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T06:42:38+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  6:42AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2012 6:43AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a tough situation. Game-oriented cons are happy to provide badges in exchange for services, which is an appealing trade-off for everybody. I can understand why D*C can't/won't do that, and why a GM at D*C isn't going to want to commit to 24 hours of games or whatever. So you have no credible incentives other than love and enthusiasm and no commitment other than what people can squeeze in between amazing activities elsewhere.<br/><br/>Maybe the "on demand" format isn't going to gel with D*C's organizational culture. Every show is different and Dragon Con is <i>way </i>different. What if you treated it like counter-programming to scheduled events? Set up a formal schedule, with games you could sign up for (in advance, at the show, whatever) and ran it as a non-campaign mini-con within the con?<br/><br/>You and Kelly put in a ton of work and resources and time this year! Please make sure to arrange it so you don't have to do that next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389786/#Comment_389786" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T06:56:26+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  6:56AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few data points:<br/><br/>--The people that took the time to write feedback on our comment cards overwhelmingly said that they appreciated the "un-scheduled" nature of it.<br/><br/>--We did take some people's information down for later games, and of those, just under half actually showed back up.  Which is pretty good, all things considered.<br/><br/>--Our biggest mismatch in effort was timing.  We assumed people would be busy doing other things in the evening, so we found other things to do instead of running games.  Lesson Learned:  people are busy in the evenings, and a LOT of them would rather be busy gaming.  We need more volunteer hours there, not mid-day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389787/#Comment_389787" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T07:00:12+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  7:00AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We organized a GoD event for Tracon in Tampere just last weekend, too, so I've been thinking about similar issues.<br/><br/>How about this for remunerating and motivating the GMs: pay every GM/game organizer with Villages hours, 0.2 hours per processed customer or something like that. (A thread explaining the concept is <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17001/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, for those who've missed it.) Finance the operation by collecting donations from the community in advance; presumably anybody who appreciates what GoD does for the cultural environment will be happy to pitch in a little bit of Villages time or money (which in turn may be turned into Villages hours by buying hours from anybody willing to sell).<br/><br/>A happy advantage of this solution is that Villages hours are pretty much only good for SG-related cultural services, so GMs thus rewarded will turn around and spend their reward in constructive ways that will also benefit the community in the form of more completed projects and increased activity.<br/><br/>The practically cleanest way to handle collecting and handing out currency like this would probably be by starting a dedicated node at Villages for Games on Demand (so the node is not for some specific person as usual, but rather for the collective endeavour, sort of like if GoD was a company): anybody could then donate hours to GoD activities between conventions, and any excess or deficit could be made good over a longer time-frame, instead of having to balance the books on a convention-by-convention basis. Keeping the GoD node solvent would be a common responsibility between anybody and everybody who care about reimbursing GoD GMs for the outreach work they do. The specific rewards given out could easily be reduced or increased on the basis of the current balance/support the GoD node manages to gather.<br/><br/>For practical imbursement, you might simply handle the paperwork after the convention, as you have your records for who GMed and what. Could also do paper coupons or whatnot, whatever seems to make the most sense. Probably should have some pre-thought suggestions for what people could do with the Villages hours they earn, just so those who are not familiar with the system can get some idea of what to do with the funny money you're giving out. "Person X will give you a limited edition Apocalypse World playbook for 2 Villages hours" or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389789/#Comment_389789" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T07:15:12+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  7:15AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I'm all for that in theory.

You know what I liked about college, learning and parties.  What about getting GMs to sign up a good bit in advance.  Then set up some G+ panels and seminars on running focused con games in general and running specific [high demand] games in particular.  Facilitate the GMs brainstorming/workshoping/pitching their own scenario ideas among themselves (perhaps with some designers offering input or advice).  Then, the last night of the con, get together for a party with all the GoD folks so that they can unwind/debrief/discuss.  It'd be kind of like a fellowship/internship where you get some training, then put it to use, then celebrate, and then take your new skills with you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389795/#Comment_389795" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-11T07:36:48+00:00" title="September 11, 2012  7:36AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would love to do that.
