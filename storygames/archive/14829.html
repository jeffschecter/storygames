How do we know this GM is great? What if he says something that I'm like, "Dude no fucking way, that is terrible GMing advice, I would never do that to my players and would never play with a GM who would do that."<br/>Or are you suggesting someone who is acknowledged as being excellent at GMing a particular game? That might work better.<br/>Matt</blockquote>\nIf I\u2019m going to hire a gaming tutor, what criteria should I look for? Let\u2019s say such a thing as a resume for a gaming tutor exists. What does a good one look like and how should I evaluate it?<br/><br/><br/>If you want to explain why this is a flawed concept or an impossibility, I have started a thread over <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14828&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">here</a> for just that purpose.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337181/#Comment_337181" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T15:23:45+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  3:23PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: WarriorMonk</cite>...A professional gaming tutor would need to be some sort of social shrink, actor, entertainer, writer. Perhaps some knowledgement in math and statistics, history and filology would be a good plus. Of course, proficience with the game and supplements would be indispensable, besides of some proficience with any software needed to manage the campaign.<br/><br/>And at all these things the tutor would need to be in a level of mastery that would allow teaching it to others. Most probably you would need a few specialiced tutors instead of a single one. That's more money, but it's all for the sake of making your game experience much better.<br/><br/>Or you can play it as a game and have fun with your friends <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\n(Text nabbed from the "bad idea" thread)<br/><br/>So would you recommend getting several tutors then? I intuitively though a multi-disciplinary approach would be the basic choice, but you do have a lot of specialties listed. Do you think I could get anything useful from someone who had just some of those abilities? For example, could I leave out the ability to be proficient with software if I stuck to more simplistic, narrativist playstyles?<br/><br/>If I needed to pare down this list, which ones would go first?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337259/#Comment_337259" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T06:44:11+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  6:44AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Credentials huh?  Well, I advertise my services as science tutor through some tutoring websites so let's see how that experience translates.<br/><br/>First off is Proof of Subject Knowledge.  So there is no GMing degree or official certification, so you'll have to go by resume and experiences.  I would want to see that the tutor has been playing the specific game or in the genre for years.  I would want to see evidence of playing with different groups of people, preferably at cons or gaming clubs and the like.  Testimonials from people the tutor has gamed would have some value.  <br/><br/>The company I tutor through has a policy of offering a refund on the first session if things just don't work out between the tutor and the student.  I would think a game tutor would need to do the same because you really don't know if you can be taught by a person until he tries to teach you something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337277/#Comment_337277" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T09:30:59+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  9:30AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Get five referrals from no fewer than three different (ie more than 50% different composition) groups.
