But I have no statistics or data to know whether this would be a good strategy or a disastrous one.<br/>There are several issues that make me consider this option. The fact that I am in Italy but the game is written in English for a worldwide public makes it complicated for me to print (POD services tend to be very expensive), and the PDF only publication feels like the safest bet. But what if it's a bad strategy that kills the game because not having a physical copy available makes a big difference in the success of the product?<br/>I hope this question doesn't sound too silly, I'm really that inexperienced so any advice on the subject would be of immense help.<br/><br/>Also, suppose I publish in PDF only, and I have enough success wit the game that people request me to print it. Would publishing a physical copy of the game in a later time be a good idea?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387399/#Comment_387399" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T06:24:36+00:00" title="August 18, 2012  6:24AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Suna!<br/><br/>Over the past ten years, the strategy of publish in PDF first, then use the proceeds to finance printing books later has proved to be generally effective. Publishing in digital is essentially no-risk, in that you're not sinking money into stock that may not sell, and you can leverage tracking tools to analyze how and why you sell copies when you do.<br/><br/>I've never heard of any scenario where having a PDF version of a game early made some kind of negative impact on publishing a print version later, though I certainly don't know everything there is to know!<br/><br/>Whether publishing physical books later is a "good idea" or not depends on what you consider success. If you have a vocal audience demanding print, and you want them to be happy, then I think providing books is probably a good idea. If you lose a bunch of money printing books that don't sell, that's probably not a good idea.<br/><br/>Have you looked at the current options available through the <a href="http://onebookshelf.com/" rel="nofollow">OneBookShelf</a> folks? They run DrivethruRPG.com and RPGNow.com, which are (to my knowledge) the webs biggest RPG PDF portals, and they have a print-on-demand program where you can set up your PDF to be printed as a one-off book for an individual purchaser. I haven't used this feature, but my understanding is that it's pretty decent quality, and as long as you have your file set up correctly, they handle the logistics. Basically, a purchaser can buy a PDF, or buy it in print, whatever they want, and you just get a different royalty from the sale.<br/><br/>Finally, in reference to statistics and data, I know that my sales have shifted AWAY from print towards digital over the last 2-3 years. These days, my sales are something like 75% PDF, except when I'm having a sale. For small-press niche products, print may actually not really be necessary in the current marketplace, unless it's important for you to be in retail stores.<br/><br/>Hope some of that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387402/#Comment_387402" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T08:31:05+00:00" title="August 18, 2012  8:31AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Nathan!<br/>Thanks a lot for the comment, it is indeed of great help!<br/><br/>One thing that might be worth pointing is that a reason why I'm asking this is that I'm not very keen on using IndieGoGo. I know it's going to require time and dedication, but my life right now is extremely busy and I'm not sure I could handle it...

That being said, and even though I buy all of my RPGs as digital copies now, there is something special about having a book in your hands. Some people like it, some don't care (I'm of the latter).<br/><br/>Kickstarter and IndieGoGo seem to work for two models, your project would be a good candidate for the pre-order version (more of a marketing concept than an outright stated feature, check out Ryan Macklin's blog for more). Those pre-order sales can get you the upfront money necessary to get the print service set up, maybe through something like LuLu.com.<br/><br/>Check out Evil Hat's sales report (they list it on there site). They sale many more digital copies than print copies, but those print copies are still money, so worth it in many circumstances. <br/><br/>Decide if a print version is important to you, as the publisher of the book. If having a print copy is something you consider important, put it out. If not, go .pdf and be open to the possibility from fans of the work to want a print copy. If it does well digitally, it may be beneficial to offer it in as many versions as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387426/#Comment_387426" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T16:43:37+00:00" title="August 18, 2012  4:43PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you Ryan.<br/>I would like to ask you to kindly expand on the last sentence.

If they sell well you would then consider a physical copy. <br/><br/>For RPGs, it seems that .pdf and physical copies are the most prolific. Although, I'm curious as to the validity of a Kindle product for RPGs now that Kibdle apps are readable for all sorts of digital devices.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
