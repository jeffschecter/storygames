I know Arc Dream didn't manage to get a booth yet (and I've been told but not confirmed yet they've pulled out).  IPR doesn't go there and I've never seen Adept Press.  It's pretty bleak this year as far as gaming goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
