                    So, thereâ€™s this girl, Emily, who wants to try the online â€œBreaking The Iceâ€ thing. She seems nice and knows the rules <i>really</i> well. (Like, weirdly well, like sheâ€™s a BtI obsessive or something. Anyway.) So we played on Sunday night.<br/><br/>Playing with Emily was different from playing with Jason. She uses traits much more: when I played with Jason, the traits were just background; but Emily says â€œI think you should have this traitâ€¦â€ and â€œDo I get a dice for this trait?â€ and so on. <br/><br/>Also, weâ€™re playing by IM, not voicechat. I didnâ€™t think this would work, but it was fine, although slower. <br/><br/>We Switch on jobs, nationalities and professions: so sheâ€™s a British male actor and Iâ€™m an American female forester. We leave the genre open (Emilyâ€™s suggestion). This makes the word web more interesting: Jason and I had decided on a â€œPiratesâ€ genre, so our webs were full of pirate words. With Emily, itâ€™s more freeform.<br/><br/>Our colours are silver (hers) and gold (mine). My web goes goldâ€¦rushâ€¦mining disaster, with a brief diversion into compasses and hiking. So Iâ€™m Veronica, a forester, originally a miner whose leg was crushed in a mining accident, whoâ€™s scared of her life going nowhere. My conflict is â€œPrefers to live aloneâ€.<br/><br/>Her web goes silverâ€¦moonlightâ€¦river, then takes a fascinating detour into â€œRiver Godâ€™s daughterâ€ and Poseidon, with a bit of  â€œFord Triumphâ€. So sheâ€™s Bernard, an actor, who drives a Ford Triumph and tinkers with cars. Her conflict is â€œPoseidonâ€™s daughter, the river goddess, is in love with meâ€, and who hasnâ€™t been in a relationship like that?<br/><br/>The first date starts with Bernard breaking down on Highway 1 in his Ford Triumph. Veronia tows him to her log cabin: and, as we arrive at the cabin, itâ€™s my first turn, so Iâ€™m describing the cabin in lush terms to get dice from Emily (â€œThereâ€™s a smell of warm woodâ€, â€œFish cooked with dill and butterâ€). <br/><br/>But weâ€™ve got a problem: weâ€™re rolling <i>too well</i>, so we donâ€™t need rerolls. I claim a reroll I donâ€™t really need, just to introduce a problem into the date (â€œYou see, in her eyes, she doesnâ€™t want you here tonightâ€).<br/><br/>We do a bit of romantic stuff (hands on shoulder, voice catching in throat, that kind of thing). So far, of course, itâ€™s been standard dating stuff. Then Emily brings in her conflict and everything changes.<br/><br/>Emilyâ€™s conflict is about a river goddess. So (Emily narrates) a fog rises from the river and Bernard wanders, drawn, towards the river. <br/><br/>Now itâ€™s my turn, so I do a bit of heroic stuff with a flaming brand from the fire, fighting the fog back. Finally, we get rerolls, so I narrate my leg giving way and me getting washed downstream. We end the date there. <br/><br/>Man, this is a long post, no-oneâ€™s going to read this. Iâ€™ll go faster. So far, the interface is working well, except that Emily keeps suggesting traits to add, and my interface doesnâ€™t do that, so I have to edit the database.<br/><br/>Second date: itâ€™s morning, Veronicaâ€™s made her way back to the house, and we do a bit of Bernard taking care of her: he feeds her fish stew and she gets food poisoning.<br/><br/>Now, we do pretty much the same again, but more so. They go to the river, theyâ€™re attacked, Bernardâ€™s dragged down under the waves, Emily uses her â€œdancingâ€ trait to describe jumping lithely from rock to rock, thereâ€™s a big fight with a sea serpent. Fun at the time but boring to describe here. <br/><br/>Suffice it to say that Emily reincorporates her cellphone, which she throws at the serpent; and I do a huge, bloody ridiculous reincorporation, narrating Veronica jumping the broken Triumph off the river bank, slamming into the serpent. End of date.<br/><br/>Itâ€™s now 1am for me, and Emily asks if I want to end, but Iâ€™m enjoying myself. We discuss the third date: Emily wants Poseidon to wreak revenge, I want to destroy San Francisco (I like apocalyptic). <br/><br/>We start with Bernard driving back to San Francisco. Emily gets rerolls: so she narrates getting stopped by the cops and then racing away. So itâ€™s my turn: I want to start the apocalyptic thing, but Emily wants an emotional scene. So we do a bit of Veronica missing Bernard, tortured dreams, etc. <br/><br/>Now I <i>insist</i> on destroying San Francisco. So theyâ€™re driving across the Golden Gate, a tidal wave hits, they plunge into the bay.<br/><br/>Now, Emily notes one of my traits, â€œHas unnaturally good eyesightâ€, and suggests that my character is, herself, a god. I hadnâ€™t thought of this, but itâ€™s very cool. <br/><br/>So Veronica has a Godzilla-like showdown with Poseidon; Bernard ends up running down the Castro. We end up with the couple perched atop the Transamerica Pyramid, with Bernard suggesting they go for a coffee, because they really need get to know each other.<br/><br/>It was an extraordinarily fun game. Again, the â€œonlineâ€ part didnâ€™t make much difference: there were a couple of glitches in the interface which Iâ€™ll fix. Playing by IM was probably slower, but still involving. Fun stuff.                </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>IM probably allows more colorful and considered responses, actually.</blockquote>
At the risk of a tangent, I think this is something that people who talk about making games 'for IM' or irc seem to overlook. I remember being pretty disappointed with Code of Unaris precisely because of its assumption that RPing via text message would be fast and involve a lot of short declarative sentences -- the exact opposite of my experience in text-based roleplaying. Hacking a single word in what the other person said is a lot less punchy if they just wrote two paragraphs of description, and it seems like the 'fast and furious' approach is trying to overcompensate for the fact that text communication is slower than talking. Like I said, it's a tangent, but people have been mentioning Unaris and similar types of (theoretical) games in other threads, and so it's been on my mind. <br/><br/>To turn it back towards the thread, I'm curious what Graham's thoughts are regarding the differences between the Skype and IM mediums, with these two examples of AP specifically in mind. Graham, do you agree with Jason that you had more time for 'colorful and considered responses'? Or more time in general to think about what was going to happen next?                        </div>

Yes, it's at <a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/breaking" rel="nofollow">http://www.catchyourhare.com/breaking</a>. <br/><br/>I was waiting to test it on Firefox 7 / IE 7 before I made a big announcement about it being ready. But do try it and let me know how it goes: if you could post an Actual Play, that would be great.<br/>

Good question: I don't agree with Jason, actually. Although playing the game over IM was fine, it was slower, and it wasn't the sort of slowness that let you consider your responses: you were waiting for the other person to respond. IM was fine, but I think voice chat was better. <br/><br/>I'd be very interested to hear more about your experience with Code of Unaris, although perhaps in a new thread?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Thank you both!<br/><br/>Mo, actually, the play's logged already. Well, sort of. Everything that you type into the interface goes into the database. <br/><br/>So if I look now, I can see that one of the word webs in the last game contained Yellow, Sun, Desert, Coward, Soldier, Africa, Apartheid, Life, Death, Hatred, Race, Thirst (which is <i>fantastic</i>, by the way).<br/><br/>As well as typing stuff into the interface, you have a conversation over IM or voice chat. That won't be logged except, if you're using IM, it'll be logged by your IM client.<br/><br/>Doyce, if you get a moment, I'd really like to hear how your game worked out for you, or didn't. Looking at the database, it looks as though you started over at one point, and didn't  finish. Were there problems?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

Nope.  I just didn't have another player set up at the time, so I got to the 'find someone else to play with screen' and that was it.  Anyone already familiar with the game want to give it a go at some point?                        </div>

                            I second the notion that  IM actually permits much better description (at least in some ways) than table-top.  When I'm GM'ing something, I can really get my literary ass in motion on IM, in a way that sounds cool and plausible.  In person, I'm much more self-conscious, and the description suffers.  Table-top gives you immediacy, gestures, tones of voice.  But the written word can be extremely atmospheric.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding BTI -- I picked it up for my girlfriend as one of our anniversary presents in July.  We've been meaning to play--and even cooked up characters on two separate occasions, but never got around to playing.  Since this is Cindy's first RPG experience, I don't quite know how to close the deal: if we make up characters a THIRD time, it's going to be a drag.  If we use the old characters, we might be in a different mindset now and it won't be as immediate or fun.<br/>
<br/>
How long does it take to play a game of BTI face-to-face?  I'd figure around 30 minutes for chargen and about 2 hours for the game itself, but I'm not basing that on anything.<br/>
<br/>
PS - Her first character was *incredible*.  "Blue" led to, first things first, bathrooms (because our bathroom is blue), and then also the British Navy, and lots of other stuff.  We had, essentially, Mata Hari meets Commander Arthur Dent... but she lost interest in the character, and we had to start over.                        </div>
