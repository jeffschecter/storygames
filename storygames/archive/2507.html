Also, maybe there's something to take from the fact that (though we didn't get to see it in play) if there are enough folks the minor roles shift into a sort of semi-PC status.<br><br>LARPs can often have some trouble with "winding down" a scene, if there's a larger number of players involved and it's not clear what the major issues are...  It can also take a lot longer to play out certain sorts of interaction than over a tabletop.  It'd take something conscious in terms of structure to be able to get all of the Roach's key scenes in; perhaps a LARP version would be better suited as one of the very big events over the course of a single session, with command cards etc happening at fixed time intervals rather than just once per event?<br><br>Anyhow, it'd probably end up with a somewhat more event-focused feel, but it could almost certainly make the transition, I'd think.<br/><br/>- D.J.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_57925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57925/#Comment_57925" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T15:47:32+00:00" title="February 23, 2007  3:47PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2007 3:50PM by Graham.">edited February 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's interesting. OK.<br/><br/>So I imagine the players are at an event: something like the Founders Day Halloween Ball. They won't frame scenes, in the tabletop sense, but they'll go up to other players and start scenes. That's nice. Perhaps there's three or four of those events in the full game.<br/><br/>They'll all have Command or Opportunity cards, and those will work really well, because they'll give the players things to do. They're golden, in fact: telling a LARPer to initiate a war of words or try to have sex with another character is great. I don't know exactly when they draw new cards: it needs some thinking, but it's not too hard.<br/><br/>(Don't worry too much about the sex. Like you say, a quick veils discussion will sort that. Hell, my Meat Loaf game had threesomes.)<br/><br/>They can't really bring NPCs into conflicts, so that's a difference from the standard rules. Perhaps they get similar bonuses for bringing other PCs into conflicts. That's difficult.<br/><br/>You'd probably have counters for Reputation. That'd work well. <br/><br/>But then the conflicts are hard. Dice are a bit much trouble in a LARP. I mean, you could use cards or something...I don't know. Not quite sure what to do with that. Perhaps you could use cards, but you'd really have to keep it simple. Perhaps you could do without any conflict resolution system beyond GM fiat: that often works well in LARPs.<br/><br/>Of course, this isn't Jeepform, it's...I don't know...the talky, non-immersive, murder-mystery-esque style of LARP that I like.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_57931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57931/#Comment_57931" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T16:57:45+00:00" title="February 23, 2007  4:57PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, illuminate me: how does a LARP shift scenes?

It lists a number of roles; you each pick one, based on what suits the character you have; settle arguments with paper-rock-scissors or some shit, whatever.  Each scene comes with an escalating list of 'stuff to do'.  At the end of the scene, the players rate each other on how cool the other were in the scene, towards the awards at the end of the night.  Then we do a different scene.  There are several scenes running at any given time."</i><br/><br/>Contrast it with this:<br/><br/><i>So, we were walking downstairs, and the organizer and a couple of actors got signaled ahead of us, all in robes and shit, so that we'd interrupt the human sacrifice before it was really rolling but after it was obvious what was going one.  And that was the start; the rest was us and them.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_57951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57951/#Comment_57951" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-24T00:06:08+00:00" title="February 24, 2007 12:06AM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Chris, can you outline the infection mechanic?</blockquote>\nJason, it could work something like this.  One or more people start out with the Roach.  As part of a scene they go up to another player and make the offer, "Do you want to be awesome?  Well it's going to <b>cost you</b>."  So it's a bit of a selling process to get the Roached players to infect others.  That's what I meant by the vampire reference.<br/><br/>But like the cards do, occasionally a Roached player is just going to walk up to you and say, "Guess what buddy...you got it" and hand them one of those damn black rubber roaches with no questions asked.

At the very least, the scenes are long, to give players chance to wander around and talk to different people. And yes, to switch between scenes, someone would shout: "OK, guys, you see the ritual starting. Gather into a circle" or "And let's cut there. It's now two Christmasses later".<br/><br/>(That's the convention I know, by the way: as Levi indicates, there's others)<br/><br/>The difficulty is: how much of the original rules to retain? If you just want to preserve the Roach flavour, then just design a LARP set at  Pemberton University, with pregen academic characters who compete for reputation, and some rules for spreading the Roach, like Chris's. Easy.<br/><br/>Or we can take the original rules as our start point, and cut out everything that doesn't work in a LARP. This way is harder, because we have to look at things like conflicts and find replacements similar to the original rules but which work better in a LARP.<br/><br/>I think there's a happy middle ground somewhere, where you take the original rules, cut out the non-LARPy bits, and end up with a light ruleset that looks a bit like the original rules. It's difficult, though, and I think the problem will be the conflicts.<br/><br/>(We need Steve, who posts as GB Steve, to come in on this. He's better at this than me.)<br/><br/>Jason!

Even reputation as a currency seems a little dodgy to me, although I know you've run competitive LARPs, Graham.  <br/><br/>As far as "mandatory roaching", the cards handle that - if you draw a "you are now Roached" card, you need to seek out a player who is a Roach slave and get them to share.

If I did it off season it'd be cheap enough. I'd require period costume. I'd make sure the whole place was decked out appropriately too.<br/><br/>I'd condense the events calender from the game into a weekend worth of events, split nominally into morning/afternoon/evening. Start with a cheese and wine social when folks arrived on the Friday, for example. I'd hammer home that the university is going to appoint a new tenure by the end of this weekend, maybe seed each events with additional stuff up for grabs. I'd have a few folks on hand to NPC appropriate notables. I'd try and ensure there were enough players for alliances and cliques to form.<br/><br/>I'd give people new cards for each event. I'd also get folks to wager reputation on events before each starts.<br/><br/>I'd let the events play out fairly freefrom. Maybe with some bead discarding method of conflict resolution, with the Roach and NPCs acting as modifiers if you can rope them in right there.<br/><br/>Between each event I'd get the full profs to vote on whose rep went up and the assistant profs to vote on whose went down, based off who did what in the scenes and using a hidden ballot. If you wagered, your rep change gets modified. I might also add a few bangs for each event to boost tensions and provide opporunities to do stuff that would result in rep changes (but the cards shoudl give plenty of this anyway).<br/><br/>Then I'd just let folks get on with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62653/#Comment_62653" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-01T09:56:48+00:00" title="April  1, 2007  9:56AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Resurrecting this thread because I was going through the event listings for the upcoming Bay Area <a href="http://www.kublacon.info/" rel="nofollow">KublaCon</a> in May and found out that someone actually <a href="http://www.kublacon.info/kcsearch/kcindex.lasso?page=detail&amp;Event%20Category=LARP&amp;Event=&amp;Event%20ID=&amp;Description=&amp;Start%20Time=&amp;Day=&amp;System=&amp;KC_staff::Full_Name=&amp;Subcat=&amp;Submittal=Event&amp;rd=&amp;action=-Search&amp;sort_pref=System&amp;order_pref=descending&amp;skip=8" rel="nofollow">is</a> running the Roach as a 20-person LARP!<br/><br/><b>Love the Roach</b><br/><i>"The year is 1919 and faculty and students alike are all aflutter over the upcomming Gamma Gamma Gamma Midsummer Ball.
