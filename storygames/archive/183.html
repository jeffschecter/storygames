                    My son, The Indigo Kid, is typically awake when our regular PTA group gets together and has repeatedly expressed an interest in playing.  For that, and several other reasons, I have been trying to come up with a game to play with him.  Below, I have some extended brainstorming around such a game.  I would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions anyone has.  For background, some of the design considerations are encouraging skills (math, art, storytelling), teaching consequences, and shifting his mindset from 'heroes fight' to 'heroes help' (and sometimes they fight).<br/>
<br/>
Quick Kid in the Virtual World <br/>
<br/>
Characters are defined by: <br/>
(1)   Their sigil, which must have seven vertices and no more than two dead ends. The lines of the sigil will define cells which will contain an icon depicting a talent or gift of the character and stones which can be drawn on when resolving conflicts.  Cells can be identified in play.  (As an example sigil, Quick KidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sheet has a large circle with a K inscribed on it. The tail of the K extends out side of the circle.  The vertices of the sigil occur at the four places the K touches the circle, the end of the tail outside of the circle, the place where the upper arm touches the vertical of the K and the place where the lower arm touches the upper arm.  Quick KidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sheet has four cells.  Two are currently defined: One for being quick Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a winged foot, and one for his digimon ally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ depicted by a digi-egg.)<br/>
<br/>
(2)   Their experiences, descriptions of how they have helped others.  As they add lines of experience, they move around their sigil, coloring in vertices.  When all seven vertices are colored in, they get to add a new stone to one of their cells.<br/>
<br/>
The world is defined collaboratively by:<br/>
(1)   Drawing the map. Whenever the character moves to a new location in the world, the players work collaboratively to define that location and to add it graphically to the map.<br/>
<br/>
(2)   Picking the Allies and Opposition. The source of the Non-Player Entities in the world can vary (Digimon Cards, Action Figures, etc.) but the players work together to choose who they are, how to interpret them, and what they can do.  (For example, since Quick KidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s player owns a Batman action figure, Batman may exist in the Virtual World. Further, the addition of a Skeletal helmet from an Imaginext toy to Batman means he can Digivolve into Skull-Batman.) Players should allow their imaginations to run free and not get caught up in how Ã¢â‚¬Å“it works in the showÃ¢â‚¬Â or other previous interpretations.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanics (Proposed):<br/>
(1)   A conflict resolution roll pits the total of one or more dice plus modifiers against one or more dice plus modifiers.  The highest total wins. Note that a conflict or an NPC can be defeated without having all their stones depleted.<br/>
<br/>
(2)   Each side starts with one die. They may add an additional die for each stone they remove from their character sheet (in the case of PCs) or from their pool (in the case of NPCs). <br/>
<br/>
(3)   PCs will potentially have stones in each cell of their sigil.  I propose having seven stones distributed through the cells.  Since this game was designed for child (one particular child, actually) they will also have Ã¢â‚¬Å“NiceÃ¢â‚¬Â stones rewarded by care-givers for appropriate behavior between game sessions. (This might be modified as awards for older players for bringing snacks, hosting the session, providing Ã¢â‚¬ËœextraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ props/art, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
(4)   NPCs will have pool of stones based on their relative power Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if they are Ã¢â‚¬ËœweakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ than the PC(s) they have approximately half, if they are as powerful the same number, and half again for each Ã¢â‚¬ËœlevelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ more powerful they are than the PCs. Only the stones in the PCs cells are counted for this purpose. NPCs will also have Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not NiceÃ¢â‚¬Â stones, awarded by care-givers for inappropriate behavior. Nice and Not Nice stones should be distinctive from general pools and from each other so that the players can see their impact.<br/>
<br/>
(5)   In general, no more than one stone from a category (cell or pool, Nice or Not Nice) should be used in a given conflict.  If players want to use one stone from each of multiple cells, this can be allowed, but they should be reminded that once they are gone, they are gone.  In addition, the player should explain how the trait in each cell from which stones are drawn is being used in the conflict.<br/>
<br/>
(6)   PC stones are refreshed at the start of each play session.  NPC stone pools tend to remain depleted, except for story reasons.                </div>
