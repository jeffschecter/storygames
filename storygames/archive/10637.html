But I think Rosewater's "human nature" quote that Alexandre posted up there also applies especially well to Luke's games: You can see plenty of instances where BW made a player care about something he maybe doesn't want to care about, and changing the nature of the player is a lot of work. If they're not up for the work, the reaction can range from "meh, not for me" all the way to "OMG BW is <i>fucking broken</i> and he hates GMs!"<br><br>Not to make this thread about BW. Just saying that both things can be true. I will also say that probably *any* behavioral obstacle can be overcome via system design and communication of intent.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236081/#Comment_236081" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T08:30:12+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  8:30AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's interesting is that he doesn't say "going against human [the user's] nature is <i>wrong</i>", he says it's <i>harder</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236089/#Comment_236089" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T08:48:00+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  8:48AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this about designing against human nature, or designing against customer pool expectation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236090/#Comment_236090" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T08:49:58+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  8:49AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good point, because he's not just designing around human nature in a vacuum.

It's important to note that Mark Rosewater openly states that his priority is to make as much money as possible. His articles are written from that perspective. With that in mind:<br/>\n<br/>\n- I agree that shaping users behavior is the core of game design.<br/>\n<br/>\n- But shaping a users behavior does not have to be the same as going against human nature or making the audience care about something they don't want to care about. Although it can be.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Alexandre rightfully points out that Mark Rosewater didn't say going against human nature is wrong, just that it is harder.<br/>\n<br/>\n- There are games that probably do successfully go against human nature. How well do these games sell compared to games that don't? How many of them outsell comparable games that don't go against human nature? Is it that majority? I suspect they don't sell nearly as well. But I could be wrong. I personally prefer games that go against or challenge human nature. But I don't know if I'm in the majority.<br/>\n<br/>\n- To argue against myself, it's very possible that with a tighter design, Mark Rosewater could have made his design goals with Odyssey successful. It's possible that Odyssey was an example of simultaneously poor design and difficult goals. And that the two were not as connected as he believes. I don't know. But it's worth noting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236095/#Comment_236095" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T08:57:51+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  8:57AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Is this about designing against human nature, or designing against customer pool expectation?</blockquote>\nGreat point!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236116/#Comment_236116" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T10:51:23+00:00" title="October  7, 2009 10:51AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This article may end up actually being more of a warning against the expansion/sequel release model than a cautionary tale of misled game design. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236119/#Comment_236119" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T10:54:10+00:00" title="October  7, 2009 10:54AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2009 10:54AM by Eric.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>This article may end up actually being more of a warning against the expansion/sequel release model than a cautionary tale of misled game design. :P</blockquote>\nHow do you figure?

If it succeeded, then they could advance the DS research and development, thus making it the de facto successor to the Gameboy even if that wasn't the initial intent.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236125/#Comment_236125" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T11:07:30+00:00" title="October  7, 2009 11:07AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark Rosewater's article is about what he learned as a designer in light of a poorly-received set.  It's about recognizing and learning from one's mistakes.  Odyssey had a lot of things going against it, not just complex interactions in Limited play.  It followed what was at the time, I believe, the most popular Magic set ever.  It was picking up with new characters and a new setting upon the conclusion of a five-year story arc spanning the previous half-decade of releases.  There weren\u2019t any elves.  Odyssey had a tough row to hoe, although he notes that there a sub-set of competitive players who really enjoyed it.<br><br>Mark goals are different from a lot of what is important to people designing games in this community.  Nonetheless, there's still great advice in his articles.  He's head designer of an incredibly popular game that tries to be all things to a number of different player populations.  This has been a huge part of Magic's success, the fact this it appeals to people playing on Tour for tens of thousands of dollars and those playing at a kitchen table; it appeals to multiplayer aficionados and those who turn up their noses at anything other than a one-on-one duel.  Understanding these different groups is something he recognizes well and talks about at length in his columns.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236126/#Comment_236126" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T11:09:14+00:00" title="October  7, 2009 11:09AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2009 11:11AM by komradebob.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>That's a good point, because he's not just designing around human nature in a vacuum.

I would add that had Odyssey only had one of the major problems Mark identifies it might have been more popular.  Instead, there were several factors working against it.<br><br>Also, I think it's commendable that Mark puts the responsibility for Odyssey's reception on himself rather than the players.  That attitude is good for Magic's long-term success.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236133/#Comment_236133" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T11:25:23+00:00" title="October  7, 2009 11:25AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another article from Mark which could be its own thread...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr321" rel="nofollow">Assume the Acquisition</a><br/>\nDiscusses the importance of growing Magic's audience and some tips on teaching the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to Daniel H. for linking me to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237003/#Comment_237003" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T09:59:35+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  9:59AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2009 10:00AM by Brian_Minter.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked those tips so much I started a new thread about them.<br><br><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10685" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10685</a> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
