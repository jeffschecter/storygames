They are petulant, petty, manipulative, intrusive, violently clueless, and more. Initially I though, "I hate these people, why am I reading this book?" then it hit me "I hate these people I want to see how they are punished for their actions." I'm a third of the way through the book, I know how it ends to no spoiler risk. It's just a journey of personality disordered fun. <br/><br/>Made me think that this would be a great story game.<br/><br/>I through this out for discussion of how to do it. I imagine there are many good approaches. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413607/#Comment_413607" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T06:04:52+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  6:04AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is my idea for how to do it.<br/><br/>"Heathcliff"<br/><br/>This scenario is based straight off the book with all the characters there of: Heathcliff, Cathy, her brother, Mr. Linton, his sister, Nelly, Joseph, and others (like I said I'm not done yet so I know there are more that haven't arrives - the children etc.) It could even include the fellow who the story is told to because he is as bad as all the rest.<br/><br/>I'd do it with a card system like I'm using with Fairy Tale Assassin League. Each card has a short phrase that evokes some kind of story element. In this case it would focus even more on dysfunctional behavior - and may completely lack healthy reasonable moves because they are certainly absent from the book! The cards also have art that evokes the same feel of the phrase. Players take turns playing cards and making up actions. Other players may challenge to add to the story (and steal the card away - because at the end of the game the player with the most victory points from cards "wins"). The only time dice are rolled is when there are challenges. <br/><br/>Each player is represented by a card with a picture of them and some note about what their major character flaw is. Nelly is a gossip, Cathy is violently manipulative (as is Heathcliff), Linton is weak willed, etc. The locations are represented by cards with appropriate pictures on them. Players may move between locations after each turn to set up new scenes. <br/><br/>I'd use scene cards to keep the game roughly along the line of the book: Wild children, Heathcliff leaves, Heathcliff returns rich, etc. Each scene gives every bigger victory points so people will pick them and base their actions on them. <br/><br/>This should play like other games I've done that use the same system so games should be around an hour for two to eight players. <br/><br/>The players will not have to know about this particular book but will need to know about 19th century British literature - Dickens at least. Beyond that they should know a bit about Victorian manners so they can set about violating them left and right. <br/><br/>With the right crowd this game could be very fun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Please share your games or half baked games!<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413608/#Comment_413608" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T06:14:40+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  6:14AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mayhap this calls for a Fiasco playset?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413611/#Comment_413611" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T06:50:06+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  6:50AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, there already is <a href="http://unseelie.org/rpg/wh/" rel="nofollow">a Wuthering Heights rpg</a> that is all about Victorian types behaving horribly and enjoying watching them suffer.

More of these than there will be players. Each one has some sort of sentence with blanks on it, and they describe behavior you want to encourage in play (probably in the use of the fiction).<br/><br/>At game end, these are shuffled and dealt randomly or drawn as appropriate, with each player taking one.<br/><br/>The player writes down another player they feel accomplished that goal (either on scrap paper or the slip itself if printed out).<br/><br/>For example:<br/>The biggest trollop in the entire story was {character name} played by {player name}.<br/><br/>Or whatever.<br/><br/>The players then read their card and name the player, each player in turn. As they name the associated player, they hand them the card. Whoever ends with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>Really, you could do anything with those kinds of cards. The player who used the cards most in genre was..., the most inappropriate or weirdest use of a card was by ..., and so on.<br/><br/>If you end up with a bunch of those sorts of cards, you could have a pregame phase where the cards are handed around, player to player and each places one, face down in a "victory" deck, so players would have some, limited, control over the kinds of goals they're shooting for in play ( they'll hopefully choose goals they think they'll be able to be awarded at the end of the game).<br/><br/>Whether those cards are seen before the game commences or not is another variation of course. If you have that victory deck face down until the end of play, everybody is potentially going after all sorts of things. If they're facedown first, but revealed before the game commences, players have a little bit better idea of how the stone soup is going to taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RaconteurX" title="RaconteurX"><img alt="RaconteurX" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RaconteurX">RaconteurX</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413621/#Comment_413621" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T09:31:06+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  9:31AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could see this working as a <i>*World</i> game as well. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413624/#Comment_413624" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T10:02:05+00:00" title="May  6, 2013 10:02AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I took Victorian Lit as a grad class, the professor pointed out that in the most passionate scene in the book, where Heathcliff and Catherine are pulling each other's hair and making overblown declarations and all of that, Catherine is <i>seven months pregnant</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413632/#Comment_413632" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T12:53:40+00:00" title="May  6, 2013 12:53PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's a twisted book.

These games don't have to build off of my ideas, they just need to be different. <br/><br/>One aspect that could be interesting is making rules that don't have built in gender bias. Traditional RPGs focus a lot on combat and are about rough and tumble things - that women are suppose to not be good at. They reflect this by giving female characters worse abilities. In social stories - like with the Bronte Sisters, Dickens, Thackeray, etc. - it's not about fighting, in fact those who use violence to get what they want often are self defeating, like Bill Spikes in Oliver Twist. When the goal is to get people to give you what you want, the ways to get it are wide open. It is a level playing field between men and women with all of us being disadvantaged and weak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413637/#Comment_413637" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-06T14:41:18+00:00" title="May  6, 2013  2:41PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, it's a twisted book.

What fun can you have with people who are always proper all the time? Meanwhile real life British heroes - Like Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke were weird gummers. David Livingstone was no better, and what about all those guys who explored Australia? Maybe what the Victorian era gave writers was such a solid base line to play against. Now a days the rules are pretty loosey goosey so we have to go to zombie apocalypses to get outside of the norm. <br/><br/>As to the VP system. I'm not recommending anyone else use a system like this. Lots of people have had issues with it. To me it is kind of a token system that encourages people to do something while not actually mattering to much. People who want to get more points will be picking more interesting cards (Betrayal, innuendo etc) and adding more to the game by challenges so they are doing more to tell the story. Players who just want to tell a story will do the same - but for a different motivation. In the end the story is told. I used to be a child therapist and we would have parents do token economies with kids. They were supposed to catch their kids being good three times a day and give them a gold star (or something equally silly). What they didn't realize was that the person we wanted to modify was them by increasing the number of good things they said to their kids. Sneaky huh?<br/><br/>The VP things in face to face games so far seem to be leading to fun games, but the final determination on the mechanic is still out. I hope some of you will try it out at Origins and Gen Con in Games on Demand. As with most games the proof is in the playing. I think it's fun but my tastes in games are not in the mainstream. All I can say for now is that it makes for a nice compact product that I can get into stores that new players should be able to understand, even if it is tricking them into story gaming.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413667/#Comment_413667" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-07T07:27:57+00:00" title="May  7, 2013  7:27AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah, it's a twisted book. The Brontes must have been a dysfunctional bunch.<br/><br/>Bob's use of the "action cards" I mentioned is an example of a different game. These games don't have to build off of my ideas, they just need to be different. <br/><br/>One aspect that could be interesting is making rules that don't have built in gender bias. Traditional RPGs focus a lot on combat and are about rough and tumble things - that women are suppose to not be good at. They reflect this by giving female characters worse abilities. In social stories - like with the Bronte Sisters, Dickens, Thackeray, etc. - it's not about fighting, in fact those who use violence to get what they want often are self defeating, like Bill Spikes in Oliver Twist. When the goal is to get people to give you what you want, the ways to get it are wide open. It is a level playing field between men and women with all of us being disadvantaged and weak.</blockquote>\nThough, on the flip side, it might be interesting to have rules that play with gender roles, because that's a bit of a theme when you get to these sorts of stories: people who don't fit the usual mold.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413668/#Comment_413668" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-07T08:14:00+00:00" title="May  7, 2013  8:14AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's interesting that the "company man" really became more of a hero during Prohibition (in the US).

The Lady of the manor interacts with the servant as much as with the Gentleman of the house, and the servants backbite down stairs in ways that can totally short circuit those up stairs, thus Downton Abbey.
