There are other trends that might edge this one out from the position of "being the next", but I think it's pretty obvious that something along these lines is coming relatively soon.<br/><br/>The next "big thing" will be a shift in perspective as the RPG scene gets sufficiently suffused by young, post-digital gamers, and a computer game is granted legitimacy as a "real roleplaying game". This could occur f.ex. from a successful digital initiative by WotC, but anybody else could do it as well - all it takes is basically a somewhat more complex and immersive and artistically engaging MMORPG chassis situated correctly in the market, at a time when the pre-digital crowd has thinned sufficiently due to natural causes. The outcome will be a new realignment, as some gamers leave the (tabletop) hobby in favour of digital gaming, while people are simultaneously drawn in by this new product that bridges the chasm between roleplaying and computer games in some manner.<br/><br/>This shift won't necessarily occur due to a big commercial flagship product, either - it could also start bottom-up, with tabletop gamers who move increasingly to play online, using ever more intricate tools. Once experimental indie games start getting developed for <i>solely</i> online play, with software developed in tandem with the game itself, it is a given that sooner or later a new market segment of gamers will emerge who are exclusively interested in that format of gaming. The process has obviously already begun, we all know about the various games with more or less progressive digital integration - I'm too lazy to check names right now, that's all.<br/><br/>This new school or tradition or subscene of roleplaying will have tensions between story and tactics, and it is possible that the two will not actually meet; very possible for the tactical interests to be interpreted as "not roleplaying" altogether, especially if those interests are developed with a commercial game chassis sold as a MMORPG - merely adding e.g. a GM won't necessarily bring in traditional gamers and cause the game to be interpreted as a traditional roleplaying game. If the tactical and boardgamey war gaming strands of the rpg tradition are left out in the new form, then it will be intensely creativity-emphasizing, drawing more on the current Forgite and Nordic interests than traditional tabletop games. I personally suspect that while there are some reasons for miniatures chess to have stuck around in tabletop roleplaying, it won't make the transition to the new form: it just makes too much sense to play your skirmish battle games as real computer games if you can, the rpg elements don't really bring enough to the table to justify the combination. Thus I believe that the new style will be much less tactical and wargamey than old school and traditional styles of roleplaying have been.<br/><br/>Compared to pre-existing traditions of roleplaying, the digital form (at least the thespian/storytelling branch of it) will generally be more intertextual and multimedia-heavy, involving remixing and recontextualizing existing art. Using existing media properties for e.g. your character may become a matter of course, in the same way that LARPs have generally abandoned character creation as a part of the form. You'll grab random art off the Internet to illustrate your character, there might be rules for manipulating the background music playlist in real time, and so on. It's still social, it's still creative (these two are what makes it roleplaying at all in terms of how people perceive it), but it might not even focus so much on stories or missions - maybe world-building becomes the primary assumed construct of play in the new style, you "build worlds" instead of "play campaigns" or "tell stories". Players may participate in "communities" instead of "groups", just like in the current forum roleplaying scenes and such.<br/><br/>There will, of course, be plenty of vitriol from gamers who are not interested in playing on their computer and in a game that includes intricate and static software components as part of the procedures. If the new style involves e.g. a big emphasis on world-building or some such difference from old creative concerns, that might also contribute to alienation among the proponents of older styles. They will acknowledge that this new style is still roleplaying (I'm sort of defining this shift on this basis: everything I describe already exists, the question is just when it recombines in a way that impacts tabletop gamers in a real way), but the computer interface, technical hassles and the emphasis of the new style away from whatever it is they like in their own style makes them dismissive. Same as the old rpg tribal wars, in other words <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445617/#Comment_445617" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-11T15:48:21+00:00" title="June 11, 2015  3:48PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah long-term LARPs aided by geolocation-app/mass-camera-access tech somehow.

Physical contact, full-body acting, certain types of moving or hiding or passing objects, whispers, etc., as well as casual "we're mostly here to hang out and share food" gaming.  That doesn't necessarily imply any design or play innovations, though, just the migration of other styles to computers.<br/><br/>If there's one development I'd like to see, which I consider at least plausible, it's the death of the rulebook.  Big books full of cool art and ideas are great, but "how to play" could be much more accessible than it currently is.  The first person to make serious money with a game whose rules are free/click-through-able online/a short pamphlet/etc. will surely spawn a wave of imitators.  (Some successful games do actually have rules that are accessible for free, but I don't know of any that are promoted as such or have made an effort to make those rules user-friendly during learning and play.)  It's an interesting quandary for system-innovators.  I feel like my rules are the most valuable thing I'm contributing, and simply giving them away is thus counter-intuitive... but does my audience feel the same?<br/><br/>Also agreed with Adam re: big shared RPG worlds, though my guess would be that the first step is a persistent, regularly-updated world for traditional tabletop D&amp;D groups to use as they wish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445633/#Comment_445633" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-12T07:27:05+00:00" title="June 12, 2015  7:27AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2015 7:32AM by BeePeeGee.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post.<br/><br/>I guess there could be a split into two directions (which I already see today):<br/>1. tactical oriented RPG players shifting towards online playing<br/>2. nordic/indie/story inclined RPG players shifting towards free form fun one-sessions<br/>3. some nordic/indie/story inclined RPG players playing in public performance events (social experiments)<br/><br/>As for online playing, I could see a next generation MMORPG platform borrow from Pen &amp; Paper RPG new ways of player interaction as well as provide world/story/NPC-building infrastructure for virtual GMs (or AI GMs).<br/><br/>For indie/story RPGs, I see things definitely moving towards freeform. Things could shift more toward simple, fun games with no prep like Werewolves.<br/><br/>Possibly, some nordic/indie/story RPG players may be inclined also to "<i>perform RPG for an audience</i>", drifting more towards impro theater and becoming public events like i.e. poetry slams (or dramatic social experiments).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445637/#Comment_445637" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-12T11:58:45+00:00" title="June 12, 2015 11:58AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm getting contacted pretty regularly by groups wanting to stage Fiasco sessions, so performative play is already a thing that is happening a little.

On a similar trend, "The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot" required less time but didn't produce any other content than a dungeon crawl experience without backstory. Yet, the creators just failed at balance in the long term (perhaps they already fixed it but I haven't gone back to the game to check it)<br/><br/>Edit: Just checked some reviews, they failed because they monetized it badly until it was pay for fun at higher levels. Add "being cheap" to the list of things that make a good trend become bigger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445716/#Comment_445716" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-18T13:59:09+00:00" title="June 18, 2015  1:59PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neverwinter was great for building scripted adventures like the one that shipped with it.
