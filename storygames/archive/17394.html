Conflicts and powerful moral issues are nice, but you need to surround them with scenes in which they are contrasted with, or embodied by, description of characters and action and environments that are to no narrative or moral purpose. The characters themselves need time to reflect, and the players need space in which to do the same -- though there is no reason they could not be given that space in the middle of a hard-fought conflict. (The Wuxia genre is full of these sort of interludes -- often an entire kung-fu fight takes place in this sort of space.)<br/><br/>Maybe I am just a Kantian at heart, but I think he was getting somewhere when he discussed 'purposefulness without purpose' -- truth and beauty are not emergent properties, that you notice after the fact, they are things you experience in the moment. They may appear to serve the story, perhaps -- but they don't.

The way I recollect the stories is very different from the way I play those same stories.<br/><br/>For example, I was playing a Mouse Guard game recently. We killed a great horned owl. While were were playing it was tense and fun, lots of stuff to think about, some good roleplaying, and a helluva fight. It was only afterwards that the poetry came, in recollection who we were, what we fought for, and what we accomplished in service to the territories.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's different for other people, but when I'm playing a game I'm mostly focused on playing the game and making things happen. Only after I'm out of the fray can I see the beautiful narrative emerge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393986/#Comment_393986" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T15:49:46+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  3:49PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Truth, beauty and goodness; the classical virtues; <br/>- Do you work consciously to incorporate them in game-play? </blockquote>\nWow.

We played a game of <i>Fabula</i> (Norwegian frpg), with focus on sensuality and sex, and then we discussed it.<br/><br/><b>The game</b><br/>- succeeded in creating a poetic and sensual ambience, with strong scenes tapping into that theme. <br/><br/>A very poetic and sensual master-apprentice relationship was central to it, two males, with the apprentice learning to swim in a lake under the moon, and a water spirit (NPC) contributing in a playful manner. <br/><br/>The sensuality was also very much present in the relationship between a male weaver of destinies, and a strong female rover. He built her a nest of twigs and moss, helped by a singing nightingale (NPC). Her name; <i>Leulene</i>, meant "nightingale", so the symbolism of the bird helping out was strong. Her destiny was weaved by him, in a very detailed and laden sex-scene. The "vision" of her future was made up entirely by the player of the weaver, of course, and given to her when they both entered the orgasmic state.<br/><br/>Later the nightingale gave up its life, and that was interpreted by the weaver as giving strength to her destiny.<br/><br/><b>The discussion</b><br/>- the group were experienced players/GMs, some of the best in Norway, so the discussion was of high quality.<br/><br/>No one were content to play this only once, of course. So we had to moan a bit over the end of the game, and the short lives of the nice characters.<br/><br/>We talked a lot about how positive content is paramount in making really engaging conflicts, but also about the real possibility of making games with positive content that don't have to be threatened by conflict; poetic/beautiful/stirring content is valuable in itself. I've been doing a lot of this lately, and I'm starting to see a broad landscape of interactive beauty opening up for exploration ...<br/><br/>We talked about the very detailed and long sex-scene taking place in the game, by the newly developed "sex-technique" used in Fabula; <br/><i>- take hands; look into the eyes of each other; take turns narrating how the sex plays out; as detailed or general as you like it to; end it when one of you withdraw his/her hands; no others will disturb your interaction.</i><br/>The sex worked very well in this game; there were no awkward moments in it. It had a very nice build up with the nest, and then proceeded to be a beautiful meeting of two human beings, beautifully interacted by the two players.<br/><br/>We discussed the effectiveness of the sex-technique, and how it could be (or not be) effective for less experienced players too. I have had some experiences with such players lately, and although it may be awkward sometimes (some blushing required), it is easy to make it an integral part of the game that the players accept and use for their own purpose. For the players at hand in this session, it worked very well.<br/><br/>Then we talked about ...<br/>- how a leader may frame, feed and inform the interaction; supporting ambience and cultural consistency<br/>- how the players may contribute to this, and take over most of the scene-framing<br/><br/>- how a simple plot-structure may be imposed on the game, with open elements, in various ways<br/>- how players may contribute to this, and be partial to introducing plot-elements<br/><br/>- why open plot elements is nice; as they make all players see where the game is going, and what is happening<br/>- how open elements may be combined with secret elements, to create surprise and build suspense<br/>- the three different ways of building scenario that I have discovered, in this sort of method<br/><br/>- how a leader may let go of control, and by doing so; gain a lot of free stuff to play with, from the players<br/>- how players will follow simple leads to build strong scenarios for all of you, in play, if you let them<br/>- the great advantage of methodic improvisation, and being a leader in such a terrain<br/><br/>This kind of <i>play &amp; discuss</i> is called a "role-playing salon", and it is a really fun way to build knowledge of how/why we do role-playing games!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
