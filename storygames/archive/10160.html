I've decided that I want to try something a little different with this game, and step out of my GM 'comfort zone' a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally, when I run games, we're all sprawled out at a table in a fairly high-traffic, loud, noisy area of my home. Dorito's, beer, and energy drinks are all over the place, and often times other people are wandering in and out of the room during play. It's terribly distracting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time, I wanna do things differently. I am going to set the game up in our dining room, playing in a more dimly lit area. For food, I am going to ask that players bring cheese, crackers, or fruit that we can put in a bowl or on a nice platter in the middle of the table. We'll drink wine (or juice) instead of beer and Red Bull.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want music. The problem is, I am not sure what the best kind of music would be for a HotB game. I think that classical or opera music is obvious, but I am not too well-versed in that area. I also know that Mr. Wick has a playlist that is streamable from his website, but I would like to pick up some actual CDs (or burn some) to play through my stereo.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you all have any music suggestions? Or any other ideas to help amp up the gaming atmosphere? Any particular techniques that worked well for you in this type of game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225510/#Comment_225510" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T15:02:57+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  3:02PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am obsessed with movie soundtracks -- usually instrumental -- for my games. I'll try to pick movies that have a similar flair as the game I want to run and then put them on loop, changing them up as necessary. This gambles on the idea that your players have seen the same movies you have, and will get the emotional investment secondhand. I try to avoid songs with words, because they can be distracting to some players, but sometimes you just need to put on the <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> soundtrack to get your point across.<br><br>It also helps that movie soundtracks tend to be built around themes, whereas classical and operatic albums are often built around an artist, and can thus jump moods very abruptly between tracks.<br><br>For HotB, I'd tend to put on soundtracks with a lot of power and subtlety. Just about anything by Hans Zimmer would serve.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225575/#Comment_225575" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T19:06:55+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  7:06PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I find that holding a celebratory meal <em>before</em> play, and reserving a few munchies for gametime, really works well.
