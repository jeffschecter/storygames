To see what it would look like, go here: <a href="http://www.text-image.com/convert/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.text-image.com/convert/</a> -- Download and convert Jason's "image c" (the photographer). Trust me, it looks cool. Not as cool now that non-.txt files are allowed but there ya go.<br/><br/><b>1000 Words</b><br/>1000 words is a game where the players compete for the souls of the living. Better still, those souls belong to anyone not playing the game. This game uses: Sound A, Concept C, Image C<br/><br/><b>Hell Money</b><br/>All players start with $100 in hell money. Hell money is the currency of the undead and is used to bid on the souls of the living.<br/><br/><b>The Harvester</b><br/>It's the harvester's sworn duty to capture the soul of a living person between the hours of sunrise and sunset. To do this, simply take a picture of the person you wish to capture. You may use a film camera, digital camera, cell phone camera, web-cam\xe2\u20ac\xa6 anything that can take still pictures. <br/><br/>Digital photographs are recommended because of the ease in which they may be shared across telephone lines and the internet. Once captured, the photograph should be sent to all the other players (via text message or email) for their bids. Bids are returned via email or text message.<br/><br/><b>The Soul Auction</b><br/>The soul auction occurs between the hours of sunset and sunrise. The bidders (the non-harvester players) send bids to the harvester. All players must bid and all bids must be in $1 increments (no fractions). A player that does not bid is out of the game. The beauty of the soul up for bid is entirely in the eye of the beholder. You may decide to bid on a soul because of its unusual nature, its attractiveness, or some other personal reason. Suffice it to say that the highest bid wins that soul. <br/><br/>After receiving notification that the player has won the soul auction, an exchange is made: the harvester takes the money, the winning bidder takes the soul. Souls may not be re-auctioned once won.Only the winning bidder must pay the harvester for the soul. Bidders may not withdraw their bids without leaving the game. The harvester collects the winning bid and adds it to his or her own hell money.The winner of the auction becomes the harvester for the next round of auctions.<br/><br/><b>The Winner</b><br/>Once every player in the game has acted as the harvester or a pre-determined length of time has passed, the game ends (the players may play for a week, a month or more). When that happens, the winner is determined by the player with the most hell money.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94536/#Comment_94536" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T21:10:33+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:10PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Groovy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94540/#Comment_94540" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T21:24:19+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:24PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is perverse and yet strangely normal sounding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94548/#Comment_94548" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T21:55:50+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:55PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Based on the premise, I almost want to invert that:  make having the "best" soul more important, rather than the most money.

Sure, money's important, but it's all about the fucking whim on the devil.<br/><br/>That, and it feels weirdly gamey to me.  It seems on the surface easy to have the most money: be a stingy bastard and take good photos.

Really, it was an excuse to show how smart I am by getting around the problem of how to put images in a text-only game (that and it's a game about images).

That player becomes the new Harvester with $0 in his pocket.<br/><br/>New Harvester puts a soul up for bid.<br/>Previous Harvester (now with $200) bids with $101 and wins. Repeat ad nauseum.<br/><br/>I think that the souls need a value of some kind above and beyond the winning bid. How many people bid on the soul? What was the highest bid? What is the aggregate rating of the soul by non-players? So the game is really not just about bidding on souls but whether or not the soul appreciates in value and whether or not you "get a deal."<br/><br/>But that's what second drafts are for. I'd like to remove the hell money aspect altogether and have it become a soul-trading/collecting game. I blame this inspirado for this game on INTACTO, which I saw again recently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94723/#Comment_94723" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T11:55:52+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 11:55AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it's very cool to see you participating in a design comp again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

If the subject realizes they are being photographed, the harvester must pick a new target.

When the game is done, this preson is cajolled into rating all of the photos on a scale from 1 to 100. The player who owns the photo gets 100% of the points for the rating of the photo... and the harvester gets 50% of that rating. The money means nothing... it's just how you get the ability to get the photos you think will win. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and nobody ever has to bid on a photo. Unsold photos are not rated. Photos can still only be bought and sold at night, but there is no "auction" per se, the seller just sells whenever and to whomever he likes. Understanding that if the photo does not sell by the end of the game that he doesn't profit from it at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the players have an incentive to buy the photos that they think will appeal most to the Devil, based on what they know about him/her. And players have an incentive to take good photos, because they'll get some points from them, and have more money to buy other good photos. What's neat about this is that a player might win based on quantity rather than quality. Which inentivizes players taking lots of photos. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and the assassin thing combines with another concern I had to create a new idea. How does one know that the photo is legit, and not just downloaded from teh intarweb? Well, what do they do in the movies to prove that the photo is legit? The villains hold up a newspaper with todays' date on it with their captive, right? For an assassin game, players would have to beware of anyone with a cell phone held up, and might kill innocent people because they can't tell if they're being shot or not. Don't we want a good chance to get caught when catching souls? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell we can solve for both of these...<br/>\n<br/>\nEach player has a "Soulcatcher" which is a cut out bit of paper that looks something like a web or net. The player, when taking the picture, has to hold the soulcatcher in hand in front of the camera, and get it in the frame so that the resulting picture shows the target being overlapped by the soulcatcher. If the person taking the picture misses, if the soulcatcher does not overlap, then it doesn't count. The judge of whether or not the soul is caught at the end of the game is the Devil, and nobody else. If they find it to not cover the targeted soul, then they do not rate it, and no points are gained. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowzat? <br/>\n<br/>\nDidn't know I was that kinky, didya? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99752/#Comment_99752" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T10:18:08+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 10:18AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S. for a killer game, it would be, of course, a crosshairs that you held up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99801/#Comment_99801" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T12:58:39+00:00" title="September 28, 2007 12:58PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahh, I misread the initial rules.
