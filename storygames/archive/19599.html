It was a good experience, but for me I think the problem was that it seems like it should be a one-shot game but it's really meant to be played across several sessions, which I could never muster. When I discovered Fiasco it superceded it by offering something more in line with what I was looking for in terms of format. But IAWA just oozes wonderful sword and sorcery atmosphere, and I would love to revisit it sometime (or perhaps try the In a Wicked Archipelago mash-up).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435557/#Comment_435557" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T11:25:57+00:00" title="July 21, 2014 11:25AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Don't say "deeply"  - it's just a little flawed.

It is still my favorite fantasy game, because yes, so much action, so much intrigue in every game. <br/><br/>I find it's still a pity that we don't have anything comparable on the market, not in english and certainly not in german (I'd do a translation in a heartbeat). Owe list? Unique. Scenario creation via oracles? Fiasco does it, but with less inspiring "oracles". Negotiation with a stick? Unique. "No you f***ing don't, a**hole!"? Unique. Best interests? Again, Fiasco does it, but not directly pointed at other characters.<br/><br/>The other gamers at yesterday's game were new to IAWA and for them it took some time to grasp the flow of the game. But that's normal, IAWA and DnD are miles apart.<br/><br/>To the flaws... the forms, they can be abused, but if you keep to "forms follow fiction" then it is no real problem. I often ask: "Hey, I don't see so much why this action is covertly. Can you explain?". Then there are these two-on-one conflicts I am not clever enough to orchestrate. So it's always one-on-one with lending particular strengths. My way of running IAWA has developed over more than a dozen games. I am sure a lot of things how I run the game are not in the rule book, but that's not really a problem for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435596/#Comment_435596" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T02:44:29+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  2:44AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These were the problems I had with In a Wicked Age:<br/><br/>I was GMing and my NPC was a lady cursed to become a monster and she was after this amulet along with the her husband the barkeep played by another player.  As I was GM I described the scene and stated that my character would grab and destroy the amulet.  The other player objected to this and we initiated the conflict mechanics.  We didn't set stakes, we just described who was on top in the struggle, I wanted to see if I could get the player to beat on his wife.  At the end we'd been fighting and the amulet had gone back and forth.  I was the last one to describe my character having it but the other player had won.  The player tried to negotiate for the amulet but I was more than willing to accept injury.  As I'd taken an injury and we'd established my character last had the amulet I said that my character would have the amulet and destroy it.<br/><br/>And then everyone was upset because I won twice in a single loss.<br/><br/><br/>Another time I was GMing a scene where a necromancer was preparing a sacrifice of children and another player wanted to jump through the window and kill him.  The necromancer's player won the conflict and negotiated for "You get driven off and the necromancer gets to complete his task."  The other player agreed to this outcome.  But then as we descirbed the necromancer doing his deed the player wanted to jump through the window and kill him.  The player said that there was no reason to stay away once the necromancer had stopped paying attention to him.  I said that was not what they agreed.  He said there was no way he wouldn't try again once his character had left the room.<br/><br/>The player was upset because he thought I was dictating his character's behaviour, when he'd already said what the character would do. <br/><br/><br/>In the same session two players wanted to convince a ghost of a priest that I was GMing to betray the necromancer.  I said that they couldn't just negotiate to initiate the conflict mechanic.  They had to take some kind of action.  IT had to be physical.  <br/>They told me they couldn't fight the ghost as he was a ghost.  I said that it needn't be violence, merely something the NPC would try to oppose.  I suggested they damage his church tower as an action that would work.  <br/>The players then didn't want a conflict saying they just wanted to negotiate without mechanics but everything they suggested was against the ghost's best interest to grow his glostly congregation.  They knew the necro guy was promising to add to his flock by trapping souls but nothing they said improved the ghost's situation.  <br/><br/>And then they were upset because they had an impossible opponent.<br/><br/><br/>I think I was wrong in the first problem but not in the other two.  I asked for advice online at the time but I don't think I was understood.  I've not been back to IaWA since.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435598/#Comment_435598" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T05:35:05+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  5:35AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>IAWA is my go-to game of choice for rules-lite PVP in settings of my own creation.

Instead of tying them entirely to motivation, tie them to possible arenas of conflict.

A god-being who is powerful beyond mortals, but insecure in his stature as a god, might be strong "with mighty forces beyond ken" but weak when dealing with a crowd ("at the helm of a multitude"). But a young, lost, innocent maiden's strengths might be face-to-face, one-on-one ("in the intimate embrace of the night", and "the eyes are the window to the soul"). She can win a passionate conversation by the riverside under the moon, but not a battle against the King's guards.<br/><br/>I'm not sure this is a *good* idea; it was just something that came to me during the night.<br/><br/>In any case, I do think that IaWA would still be a fantastic game if we replaced the conflict resolution mechanism with just about any other method (e.g. even Fiasco's black and white dice), so long as the Owe List still functions.<br/><br/>(If someone feels otherwise, I'd love to hear why, though.)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steffen" title="Steffen"><img alt="Steffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steffen">Steffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435837/#Comment_435837" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-27T08:48:36+00:00" title="July 27, 2014  8:48AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I'd really like to hear the conflict resolution system you think fits the best!

I love using the forms because this is a world where a toddler could take down a god. If they were statted out for Strength, Dexterity, etc. it wouldn't even be a fight. I also love the back and forth and switching momentum of the advantage die. I just wish everything weren't so <i>fiddly</i>. I have put much thought into how to keep the good stuff and lose the bad stuff and here's what I've got: nothing.<br/><br/>Although a new though appears. What if each Form was a deck of cards you got to build. You're good in "For Others" so you put mostly Aces and face cards in there, but also a few lower cards so you can add some of the higher ones to "With Love" because that's also a place you see yourself as strong. "With Violence" gets 2s, 3s, and 4s; you know if the knives come out you're undone, anyway.<br/><br/>That may actually make everything worse, but it's an idea I had. I was also wondering about bidding and seeing and raising. I'm all over the place over here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435904/#Comment_435904" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T15:46:32+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  3:46PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2014 3:47PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Which parts do you find fiddly, Keith?<br/><br/>IaWA conflict resolution seems like one of the simplest, most elegant systems I know (although it takes some people a few moments to grasp it, once you've got it it's very sleek).<br/><br/>You could do away with the Forms, I suppose, but just having a pool of dice. You secretly decide how many dice to roll from your pool. Whoever rolls the least dice goes on the Owe List. If you lose, "injury" means you lose the dice you rolled.<br/><br/>Particular Strengths aren't necessary to play, as we know. If you need them, they can just work as a bonus die to roll in.

As much as possible, what you do is exactly what happens, no more nor less. To me, this does not necessarily feel good, but it works well with brutal sword &amp; sorcery. Nobody cares what you want or are trying to do, unless it serves their best interests. If you want something done, you have to do it yourself. Whatever you achieve may crumble and disappear in the blink of an eye.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436244/#Comment_436244" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T12:12:04+00:00" title="August  2, 2014 12:12PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ricardo,<br/><br/>So, when you play IaWA, what happens if a player says, "I chop your head off!" and then doubles you on the first roll?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436259/#Comment_436259" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T14:21:56+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  2:21PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ricardo,<br/>So, when you play IaWA, what happens if a player says, "I chop your head off!" and then doubles you on the first roll?</blockquote>As much as possible, the character does what the player says, but the consequences can be challenged. In this case, one character takes an axe to the neck of another character. If there is no negotiation, that character is injured. Yes, you cannot kill another character unless that players says yes or you negotiate for it. Yes, that means you probably want to have best interests that are more interesting than "I just wanna kill X".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436262/#Comment_436262" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-02T14:28:44+00:00" title="August  2, 2014  2:28PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha, thanks. That seems to me like the best way to play this game, as well. The problem I often see is players discarding that actual fictional action when it comes to the negotiation phase - sometimes going so far as effectively replaying the scene (or at least that last action).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
