If you've not clicked through on one of the links yet, there are articles for 3:16, Hot War, Duty &amp; Honour, Mob Justice, Dead of Night, Pulp, Solipsist and Contenders.<br/><br/>But, more than all of that, it's a wonderful example of mutualism in action. It's something we all talk about a lot, but here is a concrete, hold-it-in-your-hands symbol of how mutualism can and does work. And it works well, producing a compilation where everything is of the highest standard. <br/><br/>I'm delighted to see the Journal available. Everyone really pulled together on this, from providing art and design talent (and all credit must go to Paul Bourne for his excellent graphic design, cover and his guiding hand on the art tiller) to writing articles for each others games. Personally, I was more excited about writing stuff for Dead of Night than I was for Hot War! I was equally excited to see what Andy had produced for Hot War (and it was a corker, let me assure you).<br/><br/>So, go download the PDF or, if you're feeling flush, get the printed copy. It really is symbolic of a group of people getting together to help each other out, promote great games and create a product that we can all be proud of.<br/><br/>Well done lads!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malc                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
