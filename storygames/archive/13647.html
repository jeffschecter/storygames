("the sh**!"), an exclamation that concludes any conflict, and the opponent remains stunned by this impromptu non sequitur. <br/>Or "your argument is invalid" which must be preceded by some nonsense phrase (you know, like in the meme) that hasn't already been used. As in "morgan freeman has cotton candy, your argument is invalid".

A corporate satire game (a la Office Space, The Office and/or Dilbert), wherein the ritual phrases all are near-meaningless corporate buzzwords and "motivational phrases".  Like what you'd see on an executive's wall, on a poster under a picture of an eagle.  Or hidden inside a press release or the CEO's email to the company.  "Maximizing synergy" "externalizing liability" "utilitzing social media to increase brand presence", etc.<br/><br/>Similarly, a game about political pundits on 24 hour TV networks could use some ritual phrasing as well, for "talking points".  Maybe each session they create new ritual phrases?<br/><br/><br/>A couple of TV shows have heavy ritualized their narratives.  A mystery game based off of Monk would need ritual phrases "he's the guy" (which allows Monk's player to decide one NPC did the crime, no matter how implausible) and "here's how it happened."  A Phineas and Ferb RPG would need ritual uses for phrases like "hey, where's Perry?" and "aren't you a bit young to be [doing whatever]?" "Yes, yes we are."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308536/#Comment_308536" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T09:35:21+00:00" title="January 17, 2011  9:35AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of genre ritual phrases!<br/><br/>Imagine a game where these phrases could be used:<br/>- "I want that ship, not excuses!"<br/>- "I've got a bad feeling about this..."<br/>- "Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308550/#Comment_308550" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T11:16:27+00:00" title="January 17, 2011 11:16AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2011 11:31AM by jdfristrom.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does a <i>character</i> or the <i>player</i> say the phrases?

Gives the character you said it to -1 if they try to continue to be/do y.<br/><br/>"I want that x, not excuses" +1 to manipulate subordinates after they've already failed once.<br/><br/>"It's clobberin' time" +1 to Go Aggro.<br/><br/>"Damn it, I'm a (insert your character class here), not a x!"  +1 to do x, if you can narrate a way to make it about your character class.<br/><br/>Maybe characters also come with catch-phrases others can use on them.  "Snake Plisskin?  I heard you were dead."

He joked that the village chieftain was named <b>Ganakagok.</b> It was all downhill from there.<br><br>We decided that once he arrived there, having driven <b>hell for leather</b> through the jungle with <b>burning wheels</b> and the <b>blossoms falling</b> from the trees behind him, hoping not to get <b>poison'd</b> by the jungle creatures, the villagers asked the Driver to <b>sign in, stranger</b> at their <b>mist-robed gate,</b> for he was <b>but a warrior, in a wicked age.</b> Ganakagok had a daughter, a <b>maid</b> named <b>Polaris</b> with whom the Driver was infatuated\u2014he really had her <b>under his skin.</b> He had no trouble <b>breaking the ice</b> with her. He dropped off a transgendered prostitute who wanted to work there, and the villagers were <b>shocked</b> at the <b>human contact</b> with her. Then he traded them some supplies for fuel, but it was the wrong <b>octaNe,</b> so he was stuck there for a while in the <b>dread house</b> of Ganakagok. He was so bored it felt like he was there for <b>1001 nights,</b> far from the <b>cold city</b> where his garage was. The whole business was a real <b>fiasco.</b> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
