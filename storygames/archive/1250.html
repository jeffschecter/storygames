                    Over at the Terra Nova blog (a regularly awesome source for recent thought on MMORGs and other virtual worlds), Greg L uses a book review to talk about the formation of "ludology" as a new discipline and some of the dangers along the way.  These are very important issues for the indie roleplaying community to consider.<br/><br/><a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2006/09/academic_instin.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2006/09/academic_instin.html</a><br/><br/>Personally, I worry about trying to think of "ludology" or "games studies" as a new discipline, rather than trying to use the methodologies of existing disciplines (anthropology, sociology, aethetics, narratology, performance studies) to examine games.  Games, to me, are better suited to be an object for study, rather than a way of studying.  When you look at the "disciplines" of, say, Religion or East Asian Studies (two that I've historically been involved in), half the time people are approaching the same content from very different backgrounds and getting very different results.  And that's awesome.  But it makes me wonder if these are really disciplines at all and not just groups organized around studying particular subjects.  After all, an anthropologist who studies games is likely to have much more in common with other socio-cultural anthropologists than with, say, an economist who studies games.<br/><br/>Anyway, some neat stuff to think about.                </div>

                            Thanks for linking that. I just ordered the book from my library. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'm rather skeptical of the value of an academic approach to studying games, and here's why:  <br/>
<br/>
Some time ago, I went through a phase of being fascinated by Herman Hesse's Glass Bead Game. The term Ludology alludes to this book's German Title, "Magister Ludi". If you haven't read it, it postulates a future contemplative society who play a game called "The Glass Bead Game". The game is decribed as being not only elegant, but as being an analogue for the contemplation of art, philosophy, and life. There's are multiple online communities dedicated to creating their own Glass Bead Game. I spent quite a bit of time exploring them searching for just that goal. What I found were groups of people whose approach to game design was to start by saying "We will begin by creating an ontology". Invariably, they failed to ever get to actually playing a game. The inevitable conclusion (to me), was that that if you want to do something with gaming, you need to start with play. I am skeptical that academics will do that.<br/>
<br/>
As a tonic, here's a very cool discussion by Will Wright, a game designer and theorist who "gets" actual play: <br/>

                            Game theory would be very useful if games were the sort of product you could completely pre-design and, through enough diligence and forethough, perfect "on paper" according to theoretical truisms. We do not live in that world.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, as artisans, we do our best when we _iteratively_ construct the product. Our first attempt will be shit, no matter how much forethought went into it. The trick is to find out _why_ that first attempt is shitty, and the only good way of doing that is to _make_ a thing and examine it thoroughly. Then you toss it out and make a second thing based on what you learned from that first thing. Repeat until you run out of time and/or sanity.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like academics want to be able to "prove" a game design like one would prove a math theorem. It always reminds me of that forward on poetry the class reads in Dead Poet's Society:<br/>
<br/>
"...If the poem's score for perfection is plotted along the horizontal of a graph, and its importance is plotted on the vertical, then calculating the total area of the poem yields the measure of its greatness...."<br/>
<br/>
You gotta rip that shit out of the book, man.                        </div>

I think it's important to distinguish between what we're calling "rpg theory", and an academacised version of it. We've got a body of theory that has grown out of discussions here, on the Forge, and elsewhere, but it's not ivory tower theorizing, it's experimental and rooted in actual play. I'd call it "phenomenlogical", but that may just be my philosophy school talking. :)                        </div>

                            Well put, distiguishing between the "pure" theory and phenomenological analysis. I also just realized on re-reading that I mis-used the phrase "game theory" up there. What I really meant was "Ivory tower theories about games...."  But you seemed to understand me anyhow, so it's all cool.<br/>
<br/>
The phenomenological analyses are quite useful, indeed. And that cuts across all game types, not just RPGs.                        </div>

                            Um, guys, the discussion I linked to is entirely about the differences between people who want to study games (academics) and people who want to create games (game designers).  Certainly there's room enough in this world for both approaches. The academic approach doesn't have to be the nightmarish stuff criticized in <i>Dead Poet's Society</i>.  That would be stupid.<br/><br/>It's not about "do academic studies of games have any value?"  They obviously do, in my opinion, at least when done well.  The question is "how should we approach the academic study of games?"<br/><br/>Thanks to the link to Will Wright, Mark (edit: I mean Tony).  I'm checking it out now.                        </div>

                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>I'm sort of on the same page with you, but only sort of.  That is, I think there is tons of value to be derived from studying games from all sorts of existing angles.  In fact, my primary viewpoint for game studies is sociological and educational, which means I'm coming at it from a different direction than (say) people who approach it psychologically.  And that's awesome!  It means I can learn all sorts of wicked cool stuff that I wouldn't have considered if I were just off by myself.<br/><br/>At the same time, I'm also all for developing new ways of studying things.  Having more viewpoints is really a good thing from where I sit.  Of course we don't want everyone to jump ship from their existing viewpoint to the new one, that'd be less diverse, and not cool.<br/><br/>Which may be what you were saying all along.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

I suggest it probably refers more directly to 'ludens', which is the Latin word for 'play', and to the philosophy of Johan Huizinga, who wrote a book called 'Homo Ludens' about the importance of play to modern man. (Contrast with homo sapiens.) I'm not sure, but I'd guess that Hesse's novel was written with this background in mind, since they're roughly contemporary.<br/><br/>Making a distinction between ivory tower theory and phenomonology also seems kind of weird to me, since phenomonology is a philosophical discipline invented in ivory towers. I'm having trouble battening down my hostility at this point, so I guess I'll stop -- Jonathan put it much more diplomatically. Discarding academic theory with knee-jerk ivory tower comments is as dangerous as discarding "craft" with snobby dichotomies about "art vs. craft."                        </div>

                            My initial reaction was rather knee jerk. I've still got baggage from my own epxeriences with academia.<br/>
<br/>
When academics come to study games, some are going to do it well and some aren't. Doing it well would include, IMHO:<br/>
<br/>
1. Paying attention to play, either as a subject to be studied itself, or at least as the sine qua non of games. A theory of games that doesn't say anything about play, or that chops out kinds of play as irrelevant is immediately suspect.<br/>
2. Attention to the theory that the gaming and game design communities have already created, not as turf war over who gets to define "narrativist", but as a body of work that already exists and doesn't need to be created again.<br/>
<br/>
Almost anything worthwhile about gaming written by academics that I've seen has approached gaming from the point of view of one discipline. Economics and anthropology come to mind. I'm not sure what a bona fide ludology would look like.                        </div>

Conflicting perspectives are usually ideal, even and especially when they do not lead to a final agreement.  Far better that the economist sit across the hall from a social anthropologist than a fellow from their own field.  I would hope that ludology develops in a heady disciplinary debate rather than be relegated to the corners of individual, already existing disciplines.  If that mixture maintains a connection to the 'public' sphere already dedicated to gaming, all the better.  That said, I would be a little disappointed to see that mixture collapse into a 'pure' discipline, to see it lose its position as a trading zone.

As far as I know, use of the term "ludology" in current usage is mostly driven by Gonzalo Frasca's article and movement.  Frasca is a game designer himself, and his empasis is very much on looking at play.  He is pushing against works like Janet Murray's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hamlet on the Holodeck</span>, which to him represent a narratological view of games which fails to capture the dynamic of play.  cf. his 1999 article: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.ludology.org/articles/ludology.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ludology.org/articles/ludology.htm</a><br/><br/><i>(Edited to fix links)</i> </div>

                            The amusing and frustrating thing about being an academic studying gaming is the amazing wealth of analysis and study that has already been done within the gaming community.  There's so much stuff already out there, as Jonathan and others have indicated, but very little of it seems to be engaging with the rest of it.  The Forge stuff is all internally consistent, but I read it and then I read Daniel Mackay's &lt;i&gt;The Fantasy Role-Playing Game: A New Performing Art&lt;/i&gt; and I'm lost in Schechner-land, with very little overlap between the emic (in-group-based) theory and the academic stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Gaming scholars need to start doing a better job of drawing comparisons and the different schools/ideas together so that they can be more than a smattering of varying-size theory/study islands in a freakin' immense sea and become, like, a scholarly archipelago.  Ok, that metaphor is officially spent.<br/>
<br/>
My personal perspective as an academic is as a folklorist, with a strong pop-culture/cultural studies leanings.  Therefore, my thesis comes from several specific angles:<br/>
1) My own experience as a gamer of fifteen years, going 'hey, this one part of gaming is really interesting!'<br/>
2) Performance Studies Methodologies -- A focus on process, performance context, and integration of theatre kinds of ideas like varying acting methods and such.<br/>
3) RPGs as a hybrid genre existing in a weird place between miniatures wargames, fiction writing, improv theatre, collaborative storytelling, and so on.  Genre analysis, in the sense of formal genres (verbal play vs. fiction writing vs. film, etc.) and literary genres (science fiction, horror, western, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I think that gaming studies is already interdisciplinary, and that interdisciplinarity is important for being able to get a broader perspective.  I think that while it's cool to bring varying ideas together, if Ludology were to become well-established as a distinct academic field, it might lose the advantage it has as a subject area--in that the wealth of approaches we have with people coming to study gaming from psychology and sociology and folklore and anthropology, and so on.                        </div>

Hm.  While I found Mackay's book largely impenetrable (even moreso than the Forge :-), he was an active gamer and he draws many examples from his D&amp;D games and from Everway.  So his writing is emic in that he draws from his own personal gaming experiences.  It's disconnected from, say, rgfa theory or other prior theory -- but its by a gamer drawing from his gaming experience.  <br><br>Gary Alan Fine is more "etic" (i.e. description of an outsider) because even though he did actively game, his work concentrated a lot on observation of other gamers and describing their behavior as a subculture.  On the other hand, I found Gary Alan Fine's book much more accessible -- which I'd attribute mostly to his writing skill rather than anything about his perspective.                        </br></br></div>

                            Also reading Fine's book, you realize where the 'cat-piss man' stereotype comes from.  Some of the people (and attitudes) reflected in that book are scary.  <br><br>No wonder MADD got a foothold.<br><br>As a side-note, Frasca e-mailed me the other day about my immersion posts.

                            Just for the record, I'd like to cite Raph Koster's <i>A theory of fun for game design</i> (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.theoryoffun.com/" rel="nofollow">website</a>), which does a great job at thinking games' fundamental nature and taking a responsible stance as a game designer from there.<br/>
