                    Every so often, someone says "The Big Model is too complicated. Someone needs to write a simple introduction to it!". As I remember, Ron Edwards usually replies to this with "Sure! Write one!".<br/><br/>Has anyone tried to write one? If so, could you point me to it?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            If you're interested this is my 30 second description of the Big Model I've been giving to people lately that seems to help.<br/><br/>I contribute X to the game.  And in response to X you contribute Y.  In recognition of this we smile and nod to each other.  The thing we're similing and nodding about?  That's Creative Agenda.  Also X and Y are not atomic elements of play but rather a string of moments over time resulting in the mutual appreciation I describe.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, we end up arguing then there's a Creative Agenda disconnect.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

Oh, God, I don't agree with that at all. If I can explain relativity and Wittgenstein's theories of language so that my girlfriend can understand it, then it must be possible with the Big Model.<br/><br/>Seriously, complex theories can be presented simply. It doesn't make them less complex, but it provides an easy way to grasp the basics.<br/><br/>Thanks for the links: I'm ploughing my way through them.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Graham, <br/><br/>One of the issues you find in philosophy teaching is that in order to present a hellishly complex idea simply you have to a) have really mastered and internalized the material and b) have a style that is good for teaching and explaining. <br/><br/>I think our issue with big model is that only a few people in the community have fully done a, and even fewer of them have b. <br/><br/>Thus the issue. <br/><br/>P.S. I'd also add that some historical distance and communal consensus helps in the above process. We can summarize Kant and Wittgenstein now much more easily than people that were their contemporaries were. Really, have you read local commentary about their earlier works? Most people missed the point rather badly. But some time, a lot of people reading and understanding and sharing that understanding, and it gets easier.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>You can explain more or less simply what the Big Model is about, or what its main thrust is (Creative Agendas).</blockquote>
I don't even think the "main thrust" of the Big Model is creative agendas. Rather, due to historical contingency, that's where most of the virtual ink got spilled for a long time. Graphically, the fact that the creative agenda layer is neither the top nor bottom of the model alone casts doubt on its primacy. In the wider world, we know that things that are labeled social contract, ephemera or techniques in TBM - everything from catpissmen to immersion to die pools - can be "dealbreakers" for real gamers as much as creative agendas can.<br/><br/>Even in fora like this one, the current preoccupation is a lot more about the politics of entering material into the fiction - in Big Model terms, the impact of social contract and techniques on the exploration layer - than creative agenda per se.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/><br/>Jim                        </div>

<p>I started to write one that would specifically avoid all jargon. In other words, an explanation of the Big Model without using the words Gamism, Narrativism, or Simulationism, or any of the other Capitalized Words. I had one of my computers die and the hard drive in the other computer die, so I'm not sure what happened to the manuscript.</p>
<p>The hard part, actually, was that I planned on using actual play examples and I hadn't gotten around to writing them yet, before the crash. I was already past the GNS part.</p>

                            About that intro, when did you mail it? I have a hard time wrangling email at the moment but will search if you give me a date to within a couple of weeks or so.<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
Regarding simple introductions: the first two pages of the Provisional Glossary is my best attempt. It's meant to be read in isolation, all by itself, with the rest of the document merely being an add-on. It includes a diagram.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot take any complaining about clarity and jargon seriously if the person hasn't demonstrated (a) that they read it and (b) that they tried to apply it to an actual instance of play. If they want help doing that, they can post about it in Actual Play - you can see Levi's thread, Andreas' thread, David Berg's thread, and others in which this has been productive.<br/>
<br/>
Two pages. Seven non-circular terms that do not refer to any other terms in the later list. One picture. One invitation to easy application to your very own experience.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't done that, and if you still say "it's too complicated! it's too jargony! Waahh, there's no introduction for meee!" then there is nothing I can tell you, as that kind of complaining clearly has some other goal than actually wanting to think or learn.<br/>

                            I was coming back from doing some writing, thinking about this thread, and thinking about how I wanted to respond.... And I find Ron's kind of said what I was going to say, you know, with a more of a frustrated professor tone than I'd use... but I'm going to say what I was going to say anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I just don't think the Big Model is that complicated.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm pretty sure it's because I've been dealing with it for a while, and watching games in the context of the Big Model (as Ron suggests), but still....<br/>
<br/>
It's got a picture. <i>A picture!</i> How cool is that? Really -- and I do mean really -- I look at the diagram and I see the whole thing in a nutshell. There's no mystery, no big complicated rigamarole that needs to be unravelled... It's right there.<br/>
<br/>
I think the key is still putting it into <i>practice</i> (again, as Ron suggests).<br/>
<br/>
I have this new thing I keep saying to editors and producers these days -- "The test of the script is on the page." We can talk story outlines and script notes for days, but until I sit down and start writing actual scenes and seeing how the voice and tone play, and how the scenes hang together, it's all hooey....<br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest that the Big Model is just a bunch of conceptual stuff floating in one's head -- much like those script notes. Helpful to a degree, but not concrete, and not, ultimately, going to give anyone a grasp of the work at hand until put in the context of actual play.<br/>
<br/>
But is it complicated?<br/>
<br/>
No. What's most fascinating to me is that the Big Model, like most things that are good and interesting, is mostly about <i>life</i> -- about people, about people doing things, about people getting things done well or with complication.<br/>

                            Hi Joshua,<br/>
<br/>
You raise a point that I also almost made, but didn't... Because, as you state, it moves us away from the "simple" explanation and into a different topic.<br/>
<br/>
But the trick is not to start <i>talking</i> about all those "But..." questions, because then it's, again, just a bunch of neural-synapses firing along the lines of "concepts" instead of solid, actual comprehension and application.<br/>
<br/>
Again I say, "A <i>picture!</i> How cool is that!"<br/>
<br/>
Look at the picture, and then look at actual play at the table. It's all right there. The acts and words of players at the table will inform and illustrate all the "But..." question into concrete detail. Without that, you end up with a lot of, "But we don't do that!" when you give an example. To which the only real response is, "Well, what do you do? Actually, at the table." And that's the exmple they need right there.<br/>

                            Sorry for contributing to the confusion, Graham.  Mostly I just wanted to float the possibility that maybe "The Big Model, explained simply" wasn't so simple a proposition.  And, as I said, I'm not even forwarding that as the reality, just wondering about why it's not been offered as an answer.<br><br>You know what would be totally awesome, though, would be a "Big Model, applied to your game" guidebook.  With that "simple" presentation but also real guidance, advice, and dare I say it, <em>exercises</em>.  Sort of like all those "GM Advice" books that float around out there, but instead of advice on how to execute a proper illusionist romp, this would be advice on getting into the indie mindset.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hi Joshua,<br/>
<br/>
That's what I've been doing at the Actual Play forum in all those threads; I think it's most obvious in Andreas' (the Rifts one) because I actually labeled the levels of the Model as I went. I wouldn't mind, eventually, writing up my methodology that I use in each one of those threads, because it is the same every time. I dunno if I think it would work as a more generic, "apply this to your game" type thing. That seems to me like a "Do-it-yourself College Degree" or "Unravel Your Buried Memories at Home!" book. I think it works better through dialogue. Maybe someone else could demonstrate otherwise, though.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I want: I'd sure as hell like to see someone work his or her way through their own actual play of a given game using the Big Model, without my being involved, at the Actual Play forum at the Forge. Umm ... let me clarify, by "sure as hell like," I don't mean the sarcastic, "I'd like to see'em try!" I mean literally, I really <i>would</i> like (enjoy, love, appreciate, encourage) people to try it.<br/>

                            Would this work, as an attempt at explaining some of the big concepts in the Big Model?<br/>
<br/>
"There's this hobby called role-playing games, where friends get together to imagine things together.<br/>
<br/>
"In order for friends to get together and talk, there needs to be some baseline understandings about how that's going to happen.  Where are you meeting?  Who pays for food?  What level of politeness is required?  What's off-limits?  A lot of this understanding goes unspoken, but it's important, because if you violate it often enough, or badly enough, you can damage the real-world relationships of the participants and hurt peoples' feelings.<br/>
<br/>
"When you're imagining things with other people, it's possible for there to be misunderstandings or conflicts about the imaginary content.  One of the defining features of the RPG hobby is that groups are supposed to work out a process for smoothing over these moments.  The process might be pretty ad hoc rulings on the part of one participant; it might involve consensus of all involved; it might involve devotion to a specific set of written texts.  A lot of this procedure is influenced by, and influences in turn, the 'social contract' discussed in the prior paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
"People get different things out of the hobby; playing an RPG can satisfy different people in different ways.  How well a game, or your group, satisfies you as a player is hard to measure on a moment-to-moment basis, because it's so transitory.  But looking at things over the long run, you might be able to see an agenda at work in your own play, or in others'.  (This refers to how you feel about the shared imagination stuff, as distinct from the real-world social stuff going on.)<br/>
<br/>
"When everyone is playing a game together, and they're all on the same page with regard to their 'creative agendas,' and the system they're relying upon to smooth over misunderstandings/disputes doesn't screw up the achieving of that agenda, that's a real groovy spot.  For any given agenda, there are a whole raft of techniques you can use to help get there."<br/>
<br/>
That's kind of simple-minded, and maybe too wordy, but it's my understanding.  Have I made any errors, O Sages of Story Games?                        </div>

                            My general thought is that people who don't role-play, but who might be interested or are at least curious about something that interests you, need no such explanation at all. In all of their social activities, both the social contract and the equivalent of a CA already exists (without the "C" if it's not a creative endeavor). It's expected, desired, sought, and in fact required.<br/>
<br/>
I also think people get a little too formal in their understanding of "social contract." It's not an actual legalized document or set of explicit agreements. It's all the social priorities and relationships that operate in that group, whether overtly stated or not, recognized or not, or whatever. Any group of people interacting to do something, together, have a social contract. The question is what it <i>is</i> for that group at that time, and how that affects the stuff they are doing.<br/>

Your writeup looks too formulaic and directive to me. It's as if you're saying, "in order to play, you all must first agree upon a social contract," whereas the Big Model's point is, "if you're playing, then you're necessarily doing so in the context of a social contract."<br/>

<p>Ron:</p>
<p>No worries, I searched my sent messages in gmail and found it myself. So, as soon as I have time to address that again, I will.</p>
<p>I agree that people get a little too formal about some of the concepts. I think that's one of the dangers of analyzing any behavior. Once people become aware of the named components of a process, they become self-conscious. The only real problem with that, as I see it, is that people are sometimes interpretting the layers of the Big Model as <em>steps</em> in the process instead of as simultaneous events. In certain circumstances, it may help to nail down an explicit social contract, but thousands of players have had no trouble with an informal social contract negotiated from moment to moment.</p>

                            I believe, and possibly always will, that the first concept that should be introduced in Big Model discussions is what it is for. Without context it is massively hard for anyone to listen/read and pay attention without continually asking "What has this got to do with anything? How am I supposed to use this?"<br><br>Though, that warrants the question: what <i>is</i> the Big Model for? The answer is probably on the Forge somewhere, but so far I haven't found much beyond "to get my own head sorted out on gaming &amp; design". The Big Model is, in my mind, a tool to help you look at your game design and see whether it is sufficiently focussed on its goals, and that's how I would introduce it.                        </br></br></div>

                            Here's an interesting data point for any who're interested.  The Big Model makes most sense to me when I look at it as a <em>diagnostic</em> tool.  It serves admirably as a device for finding out <em>what's wrong.</em>  Necessarily that points a way to what's right, but from my perspective that's an inescapable consequence of the thing.                        </div>

                            If I get it, the Big Model is supposed to describe what's going on in a game session, at least in the real world.  So long as everyone's having fun and enjoying themselves, who cares how it works?  But if it starts to stink and make strange noises, you've got to pop the hood and see what's wrong.<br/>
<br/>
1.  People gotta hang out, which means having decent social skills<br/>
2.  People gotta imagine stuff as a group, which means some kind of process<br/>
3.  You gots to get paid, in terms of what you enjoy about this hobby<br/>
4.  There are techniques to help you get paid.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at some old games post-hoc, it's clear that I hated S. and R.'s behavior in the real world, so it violated (1), and there was no way to play with them any more.  So I walked, and created my own campaign.  The process was adequate (2), but didn't help me get paid (3), so I ended up going to the Forge and learning new techniques (4), which helped me enjoy imagining stuff with my friends more.                        </div>
