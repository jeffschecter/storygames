There are even props that have additional mechanical effects on play. <br/><br/>I've never LARP'd before, but it seems like the game could be adapted to a full-on LARP format with some streamlining and mechanical alterations. Trouble is I know so little about LARPing that I have no idea how they are mechanically structured. <br/><br/>So SGers, tell me about the mechanics and other logistics of LARPs you're familiar with. How did you do conflict resolution? Is there any role for dice in a LARP? Did you use props as part of the resolution system? Can a LARP involve taking turns telling parts of a story while the others listen and comment? Or is a LARP necessarily an affair where everyone walks around doing their own things?<br/><br/>Any help in demystifying LARPing greatly appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84794/#Comment_84794" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T14:39:06+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  2:39PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric J.

You have games that have pauses in the middle of scenes to do some type of resolution, while others have systems that "resolve in realtime". Boffer LARPs (games where people fight with padded weapons, bean bags to represent spells, etc) will have a tendency to be WYSIWYG and not have much "stopped time" where out-of-game arbitration is occurring.<br/>\n<br/>\nLogistics run the gamut. It depends a lot on things like game duration -- is it a 2 hour game, a 2 day game? Are there costuming requirements? Are there specific props that are needed for play? Do you need to prepare written materials for the game to run? Props and costuming tie into the level of suspension of disbelief you expect from your players (and depending on who you ask, the "authenticity" or "immersiveness" of the game).<br/>\n<br/>\nNarrative and how its established runs the gamut; some games have no authoritative "voice" and, to borrow words from the creator of a LARP I used to play, treats characters in the game like wind-up toys that you "set in play" and then see what happens. Most LARPs I've encountered have a GM who "judges" or "marshals" scene as they progress and acts as an arbiter. There's certainly a design out there that splits up narrative authority amongst the players, even if I'm not aware of it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote a game a few years ago for a one-shot game that went off with about 30 players -- went fairly well. It was extremely proto (and written under a very short timeline because, hey, we had an event planned) but it might answer a few questions. If I dig it up I'll post it so you can mine it for ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

Rock, Paper, Scissors; GM fiat (is surprisingly good); each player has written powers they can use on other characters ("Once every hour, someone must answer a question truthfully").\n<blockquote>Is there any role for dice in a LARP?</blockquote>\nIt's probably better if not. Too fiddly. Need a table. If you must use a randomiser, cards are better; or RPS; or there's other ways.\n<blockquote>Did you use props as part of the resolution system?</blockquote>\nI haven't, but there's no reason why you can't. A live version of The Committee could use, say, whether your glass is more full or empty than the other person in the conflict. Or something.\n<blockquote>Can a LARP involve taking turns telling parts of a story while the others listen and comment?</blockquote>\nNot...really. I mean, anything's possible. But...in the LARPs I've seen...no. Players walk round and do their own thing. And they don't narrate so much as act out the part.\n<blockquote>Or is a LARP necessarily an affair where everyone walks around doing their own things?</blockquote>\nPretty much.<br/><br/>Eric, how would see The Committee being a LARP? At the moment, it's a game where people narrate in the past tense. Would the LARP be about people narrating past stories? Or would they be acting out the adventure, then and there?<br/><br/>That's my problem with this, so far: I can't see what the LARPers are actually doing.

I'd be really interested in looking over the doc for your LARP. <br/><br/>I'm thinking of an evening of play, with everyone sitting in comfortable chairs and sipping various in-character beverages and eating snacks. Costuming and other props (artifacts from the expedition) would be cool to incorporate. <br/><br/>The resolution mechanics would be resolved in real time using freeform narration that is timed using an hourglass or other timer. In the base game, dice are put forward with bits of narration to meet or exceed a set difficulty level. Not sure how to adapt that to a LARP.<br/><br/>Tell me more about the marshall role - what does that person do? Are they also playing a role?<br/><br/>Edit: Crossposted with Graham. I'd like the focus to stay on the retelling of the expedition's tale, so still using past tense when telling the tales, but also allowing current interactions between the expedition members and other Committee folks. An interesting wrinkle is that while the game has an imaginary audience, no one actually has that role. A LARP version may need people who serve as marshalls that assume the role of Committee members who did not go on the expedition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

I'd be nervous of giving it to you just because I'm not sure it would make that much sense. It was, after all, a last minute hackjob so some of us could get together and play a game. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy background was TT then LARPing and then back to TT again (I don't LARP so much anymore), and having followed S-G and the Forge casually for the past few years (on and off), I can say with assuredness that a lot of the design principles will hold. So you're on the right track with your thinking so far, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn your first go, you're likely going to design mechanics that aren't going to work very cleanly in the context of a LARP -- that is, until you've LARPed before. Even when controlling the environment that closely (players are non-mobile, conflict resolution is rigidly defined, etc) some aspects of the way people play a LARP are going to be difficult to understand until you actually see it in action (or, it'll work fine and you might find that the experience is not dissimilar from the TT experience).<br/>\n<br/>\nCards are very commonly used instead of dice. I think one of the simple virtues of this is you don't have to stoop and roll dice on the ground when you're using playing cards for your resolution system. Generally (in my opinion), anything the system requires you to do that you can't easily meld into an in-game character action is going to hurt overall suspension of disbelief. Pulling cards, at least, tends to be quick (also, a little easier to do in in other conditions, like darkness).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe marshal role is either a designated GM or sometimes even just another player (and could in fact, be any player not currently involved in the conflict, if written that way) with knowledge of the rules and ability to interpret them in the context of the conflict. I can't get more specific in the definition just because the mechanics aren't really full fleshed out, you know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Martin%20O%27Leary" title="Martin O'Leary"><img alt="Martin O'Leary" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Martin%20O%27Leary">Martin O'Leary</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84821/#Comment_84821" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T15:32:56+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  3:32PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric,<br/><br/>I'm intrigued by what you imagine as the differences between a LARP version of TCftEoM and the standard tabletop version, beyond costuming and props (both possible, but rare in a tabletop context). Having read the game, but not played it yet, I'm having trouble seeing which elements you think wouldn't work in the LARP context you describe, or indeed what a LARP could add.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84827/#Comment_84827" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T15:45:57+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  3:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, "it depends" covers it quite well. In general, UK-wise, you've got the following broad categories, with lots of crossing of borders:<br/><br/>Rubber sword (Fantasy) LARPs (some of which allow soft brawling, some of which use cap guns), where a lot of resolution is by whether you can actually do something (can I hit you with Mace, yes, you lose a hit). These tend to work solely on resources and how you use them (spell points, hitpoints, uses of skills, special effects and so on). There's varying levels of trust as to whether you can track your own resources or if you have to be tracked by a "battleboarder" or things may require some kind of power card to be "official" and impact play. <br/><br/>Some use things like bead draws to do randomising, generally lots of fiat. Some of these work as 2-4 day time-in events where "plot" will wander in and happen to he characters. Some of these are "overlands' where a random group of PCs goes off to do a mission. Both kinds will have people who are dedicated to NPCing, or you'll take a turn NPCing for one part of the event. Setting can be anything from a field in Wales to a local country park or a 16th century manor house. <br/><br/>Generally real space corresponds to game space, with a referee maybe describing embelishments when you arrive somewhere or moving a timeline on. Some use calls like "time freeze" where play pauses and player close their eyes while some surprise is put in place. Big on costuming and seeding of situation elements amongst groups for people to discover in order to solve a situation.<br/><br/>Then you've got the White Wolf inspired/influenced LARPs which are heavy fiat, heavy rules lawyering and lots of people telling you what great stories they'll one day create. Heavy focus on factional antagonism and being top of the pecking order. Also lots of "being in character" except when it comes to actually impacting the fiction, when a rules debate will occur. <br/><br/>These tend to either be one-offs or ad-infinitum campaigns. Groups will meet once a month at a venue to play (generally the back room of pubs) for an evening. Resolution might be based on cards, bead draws or rock paper scissors. Generally between individual players, and calling in a referee if there's a difference of opinion or you need too affect bigger things than the person right there (often). Again, lots of real space equals game space. Occasional scene framing, but only ever by a GM. <br/><br/>Then there's con LARPs (parlour larps and freeforms), which will tend to be focused situations with minimal rules, often with some improv crossover. Often advertised as zero rules, but that tends to mean resolution by convincing the organiser (which ends up being a political game outside the game). You can get some rules light conflict resolution in some of these though, some try and import more innovative style mechanics. Many work as political events, and hence what really matters is what you believe is true and who you tell it to.<br/><br/>Lots of LARPs have ecosystems. Downtime minigames, often incentivised by XP, that become games in themselves. Write 80 page fanfic, get XP. Contribute food, get XP. That kind of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84855/#Comment_84855" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T19:27:37+00:00" title="August  1, 2007  7:27PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2007 7:28PM by NickWedig.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blake T.

It hinders immersion and all that stuff. So everything is pretty arbitrary and player-ajudicated. Like, if someone hits you with a sword, you have to use your own good judgement when deciding how badly wounded you are. And so on. It works rather well, if you're into that sort of thing.<br/><br/>That said, I've played some awesome pseudo-LARPS on swedish conventions. In one, you played the management of a Blood Bowl team (you know, that semi-american football-sport in the Warhammer world) and had to prepare for a game with another team (the management of which was played by another group). The preparation phase - making up clever plans, crazy gadgets and cunning guiles - was run completely without rules, but the actual games were played out using a simplified version of the blood bowl system. And this, of course, has nothing to do with your question but it's cool nonetheless.<br/><br/>/Kalle B                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic" title="phasmaphobic"><img alt="phasmaphobic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stuff.realitymerchants.com/pics/drg01.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phasmaphobic">phasmaphobic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84870/#Comment_84870" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-01T22:33:21+00:00" title="August  1, 2007 10:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>Is there any role for dice in a LARP?</blockquote>\nIt's probably better if not.

The dice were put in little plastic gumball-machine poppers with flat bottoms.  To roll the dice, you just shook the popper and held it forth.  It was pretty interesting and effective, and quite tangible (and I've always been a huge fan of tangible mechanics).<br/><br/><br/>I ran a successful LARP for several years in which the mechanics were nothing more than a game of pencilbreak.  Essentially, you whacked pencils back and forth until one broke.<br/><br/>Another LARP I run resolves conflicts by convincing your opponent that you should succeed, or if not possible, convincing a randomly flagged-down third party.

I had the hope of identifying those differences so I could give some suggestions on how to leverage the medium for your needs. But in thinking about it, the TT/LARP divide starts to look like more of a continuum when you try to take into account all the different varieties of each.<br/><br/>That said, I'll give a few comments, knowing full well they're not exhaustive or even representative of all the different LARP styles out there.<br/><br/><b>LARPs focus very heavily on individual characterizations.</b> There are certainly games out there where you'll play a few characters at an event, but most of the ones I've seen see each player in a single role. LARPs leverage this and turn it into a benefit by encouraging people to put a lot of effort into those characterizations, that being the quality of their roleplay, costuming and props, etc. <br/><br/><b>LARPs are, by nature, intended to immersive.</b> Much like acting, the player in a way takes a "backseat" to the character. There are different schools of thought over how much out-of-game content should be permitted to exist, but most will make efforts to minimize it. Commonly, in stopped time games, people who are standing around will have an out-of-game discussion to pass the time. I've seen other, more clever games that try to isolate and regiment scenes such that it doesn't disrupt the play of everyone around them. I think the hallmark of a LARPing experiences I enjoy are ones where I have very little out-of-game discussion with other players. This flies in the face of certain story game sensibilities, I feel, but I say it with the assertion that immersiveness weighs heavier than the need for a strong narrative in this style of game.<br/><br/><b>LARPs disseminate information differently than tabletop games.</b> This might not be true for the game you're planning, Eric, because it sounds like you're not intending people to move around very much (and everyone would presumably, on an out-of-game level at least, observe all of the "action"). But for games where players can congregate naturally and move about the play space, the story as it develops is often passed by word-of-mouth, with certain key events not necessarily being observed by all players. What's beautiful about this is, for instance, in a TT if the GM tells you that your character has learned certain information and now its time to share it with the party, the retelling can be a little anti-climactic (of course, GMs can pull players aside and accomplish this, but its more natural in LARPs because it doesn't necessarily result in downtime for other players). In a LARP, you have information that other people want -- what's more, you can choose which information to share.<br/><br/>What's more, this impacts, distorts, and mutates the narrative in ways that are difficult to anticipate. If, for instance, several players participate in a scene, the retelling of that story can take on a "telephone game" quality where the end result, and the accepted story that's occurred so far, is perhaps different from what actually transpired. People who are savvy at running these games write their stories in advance such that the broad strokes are difficult to misapprehend.<br/><br/>Finally, and this is something I'm borrowing from another game -- anything you need the players to know for the story to progress, tell them a few times. Tell as many people as you can. Sometimes when people are focused on their individual portrayals, they'll miss important story developments. If it feels like you're saying it too much, then its probably just right.<br/><br/><b>LARPs generally involve more people than TTs and require different techniques for managing the players.</b> I think any long-term LARPer could write volumes on this topic. I can say, bluntly, that you're never going to write a good LARP until you've actually experienced one -- preferably many. For one thing, no central person is responsible for the progression of the storyline. Again, this is a commonality with SGs and the transition to LARP should be relatively natural, but I'll bear it out anyway. If you run a LARP and a single GM is the gatekeeper for story progression, expect some of the players to be tightly involved in that story and others to go off and focus on something else. This isn't necessarily for lack of interest, but a single person simply can't expect to hold the attention of a large group in the same manner as you would in a TT.<br/><br/>My suggestion for managing the players, then, is to empower a few people to help out the GM. In the style of LARPs I've seen, the GM and assistants have a story they're trying to tell the players, and involve them in. Design the event such that you can entrust individual people to drive scenes that will then forward that overall plot. Make an effort to ensure as many as possible can potentially occur in parallel, or at the very least aren't gated by one another (if you design a scene upon which all others are contingent, you are a sucker and will have a bad game.. maybe not the first time, but eventually, and soon).<br/><br/>Hope this is useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84919/#Comment_84919" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T07:01:51+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  7:01AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tell me more about communication, Blake.

If you want immersiveness, and you want consistency in the accepted storyline, there are some preventatives you can employ but ultimately you have to accept that there's going to be a certain amount of inconsistency. Nine times out of ten, the players are smart enough to figure out what happened and do their best to reconcile those differences somehow.<br/><br/>That said, you can do a few things.<br/><br/>1. Make the incorrect assumptions correct (duh). LARPers accept that there's a lot going on in a game that they're not aware of, so if you can reasonably introduce more to the story that "explains away" a misconception or disagreement, all's well.<br/><br/>2. Make the incorrect assumption part of the story. In the case of your example, the players will probably do anything they can to explain why their character thought or did what they did; remember, if no one is actively observing your character, they can conceivably be doing anything that the game empowers your character to do. So maybe you talk to the GM and say, "Hey, this thing happened, I want to play that my character actually discovered that the prominent NPC had a body double who <i>was</i> killed. That cool?" Something to that effect.<br/><br/>3. Make it difficult to make incorrect assumptions, or make those assumptions non-instrumental to the story. This is just a writing trick. Its difficult to explain in a vacuum, but... let's say the story organizers want a war to happen, they might write in a warmonger that's going to push for that to occur irrespective of what happens to prominent NPC. This is very common because, hey, maybe you spent the past two weeks making war drums and costumes that're going to be used in that war anyway.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84926/#Comment_84926" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T07:22:44+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  7:22AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I hope I'm not derailing, Eric)<br/><br/>I see a strong GM hand as a common feature, with sharp constraints on player authority.

Also, I think if the story is engaging the players and they're happy with the level of immersion, they'll often embrace the railroading because they know its going to lead to developments and action that the organizers have prepared for. On the other hand, if they wish the story was going in a different direction, they'll malign that inability to choose (he says, voice laden with <i>obvious experience</i>).<br/><br/>Good organizers, I feel, will keep in mind the constraints of what they've prepared and what direction the story can take while incorporating all of their hard work, and design "branches" into the story here and there. Let's say you built fifteen bad-ass war axes, and the players have to choose between fighting the vikings or the ogres. Well, either one can use war axes, so... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans" title="Hans"><img alt="Hans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans">Hans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84940/#Comment_84940" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T09:02:29+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  9:02AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2007 9:09AM by Hans.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have only played two Larps in my life, both of which associated with Infinite Imaginations Inc (http://infinite.www3.50megs.com/) and both at GenCon.  However, since I absolutely loved both of them, and they had many similar features, I will talk about them here:<br/>\n<br/>\n* They were closed set games: by this I mean that the action was defined as only possible within a fixed set of fictional locations, the fewer the better.  My favorite of all time involved a trip in a Nautilus like submarine to the bottom of the sea, and by definition you had to stay in that one room throughout the whole game (except to go to the restroom, of course).<br/>\n* They were highly scripted in terms of character goals: by this I mean that the LARP organizers provided, prior to the LARP, a large amount of character background story and specific things that the character wants to achieve.<br/>\n* The plot arises from these character goals and the information provided in the backgrounds, with almost no GM involvement: Once the machine the organizers have put together starts going, they pretty much just let it go, without much intrusion.  There is no plot other than what the players do with the information they are presented in their player packets.  Except...<br/>\n* There are external inputs of new information that stir the pot during the game that is not contingent on what the players are doing: The story structure was such that things would happen at prespecified real times, regardless of what other action is going on.  The submarine will launch at 7 PM, and will arrive at the bottom of the ocean at 9 PM.  The meteor will impact at exactly 8:30 PM.  That sort of thing.  <br/>\n* When conflict cannot be resolved by drama, it is resolved almost entirely through karma:  By this I mean that the rules, such as they are, involve very simple yes/no conflict resolution; comparing numbers with the higher number winning, checking off check marks on a card for the number of times you can do X, etc. <br/>\nDice rolling mechanics described above can work, but avoiding them is better.  That being said, my favorite, described in the link above, made excellent use of dice, especially Perception, to deliver information.  See the rules link on the web page above.<br/>\nEDIT: Three more common features.  There were NO SCENES, per se, in the games.  Once the game started, things just happened, players just did stuff.  The only high level structure was the structure implemented by the timed information I mentioned before.  Also, both were one shot things, with no intent (like with Vampire LARPs, perhaps) that the story would in any way continue beyond that one night's play.  Finally, there were almost no NPC's in either; almost all characters were player characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn response to Jason, above, there is a strong GM, but only before the game starts.  This takes a LOT of preparation on the part of the organizers.  I was astonished at the level of effort that went in to crafting the character backgrounds and goals such that there were multiple directions things could take, and multiple reasons for each player to glom on to to make things happen in the story.  The GM's cleverly craft a set of pregen characters that are all pointed at one or more other characters, and then pull the trigger and watch what happens.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this illusionism?  I don't think so.  There seemed like a massive array of important decisions (at least, important decisions to me) that I had to make in both games.  It all arises from the goals on the character packet; you simply CANNOT achieve all of them, so you have to decide which to pursue and which to abandon.  And your decisions as to which goals to drive towards ARE the plot, since it ripples through all the other characters and their goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete_Woodworth" title="Pete_Woodworth"><img alt="Pete_Woodworth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete_Woodworth">Pete_Woodworth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84946/#Comment_84946" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T09:23:02+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  9:23AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2007 9:37AM by Pete_Woodworth.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "You have to use a light touch. If you've done your job well, people won't know you've done anything at all." - God's advice to Bender in Futurama (paraphrase)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, the best LARP organizers are the ones who avoid more overt last-minute railroading in favor of setting up events well in advance to encourage development along the lines they see as desirable. This naturally tends to cultivate the attitudes you want players to have regarding certain events, rather than ramming it down their throats (which tends to inspire rebellion). What's more, the best LARP writers allow a constructive outlet for some dissenting players when possible, knowing that in the average-size LARP there will be at least a few players who don't go along with the crowd, if only for the sake of being different. Allowing them to feel like their dissension matters without having it derail your story is an important part of player management in LARP. I'll use an example.<br/>\n<br/>\nSetup: You've been building up to a war for months now, encouraging the players to go to battle against Enemy X. You've shown them firsthand how brutal and terrible Enemy X can be, as well as carted in loads of NPCs to further decry the various horrors perpetrated by Enemy X. Most of the players have naturally gotten onboard with the war idea, but a small faction of less combative PCs remain convinced that diplomacy is still the best option. We'll assume for the sake of argument that their logic/motivation for doing so is valid, and not simply player contrariness. (Caving in to players just because they're being difficult for the sake of being difficult is another matter entirely.) Perhaps it's even because you did your job too well, and they're convinced Enemy X is so hideously powerful that the players will all die horribly if they go to war! Whatever their reasons, they've been trying for a while now to make an honest effort to meet up with some representatives of X and try to talk peace, or at least reach some sort of compromise. What do you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nWorst Idea: "Shut up and join ranks, we're marching." You've shown them their roleplaying and preparation don't matter, because they're Going Against the Story. All they learn is that you don't like people who don't follow the lead you set, and you can pretty much count on them to be mutinous in the future, not to mention grumble about your story tyranny out of game, thus potentially spreading their discontent to others.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Worst Idea: You allow the diplomat PCs to resolve the entire conflict nonviolently. Not only does this screw all the prep you put into war drums, banners, etc., but it can make the PCs who went along with the buildup feel betrayed because they were simply following the clues you gave them, and now they look like jerks. You've made a small handful of likely rather smug PCs happy at the expense of the other PCs, not to mention your staff and their prep time. Not great.<br/>\n<br/>\nBad Idea: You set up a parlay with X, and have the diplomatic PCs who arrive captured and/or killed by the enemy. This will surely stoke the other PCs to support your war effort, but you've done it at the cost of making those diplomatic PCs feel betrayed, because all they were trying to do is play their characters and you smacked them around for it. You can argue "nothing says I have to be nice just because you were 'playing your character'", but it's a little hollow since as the organizer you set up events and thus had to choose to punish them that harshly, rather than, say, letting them be ambushed but get away safely or not letting them set up the parlay at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nDecent Idea: You allow the diplomatic PCs a chance to parlay with forces of X, and after letting them say their piece, you have your NPCs continue on their course, perhaps making a few small concessions or admitted grudging respect for the PCs. This still thwarts the hopes of the PCs, but assuming your NPCs played it well, the PCs can go to battle feeling as though they had their shot and all other avenues were explored. It relies on good NPCs to make the PCs feel as though they really had a shot at talking through the deal (even though they didn't), but it can work. <br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Idea: You allow some diplomatic PCs to parlay with the enemy, only to eventually be rebuffed - or so they think. Soon after, they are approached covertly by agents of a more moderate faction of X, who sees in the PCs a hope for overthrowing the current leaders of X. In exchange for good relations with the moderates once the current leaders are gone, they offer to help sabotage the war effort on their side, perhaps withholding critical resources or reinforcements once the battle begins. (Of course, you never intended to use the named elements anyway, but the PCs don't know that, and it will make them feel as though they've struck a mighty blow to hear that they're being "taken away.") The warlike PCs don't feel betrayed, since they still get to fight and the enemy is still the collection of horrible bastards they said it was all along, while the diplomat PCs get to feel as though their methods got real results as well. Plus you still get to use all your cool war props, not to mention that badass speech you prepared for the leader of Enemy X at the climax of the battle. Everyone wins!<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: I suppose I should add that this is by no means an exhaustive list of possible responses, given LARP's multi-phasic-squid-with-ADD environment of player ideas mixing with prepared materials. This is simply a sampling of how I've seen problems like this tackled in the past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84977/#Comment_84977" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T10:31:12+00:00" title="August  2, 2007 10:31AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow a lot of new info to chew on.

But you'd be selecting for some parts of the 'standard' Larp experiences very strongly, and away from others.<br/><br/>My biggest recomendation is that you describe what you want "play on the floor" to look like in greater detail (though what you have up there is a good starter), and especially talk about the common interactions between characters that are the "baseline" entertainment of your intended game.

Having read the game, but not played it yet, I'm having trouble seeing which elements you think wouldn't work in the LARP context you describe, or indeed what a LARP could add.</blockquote>\nMartin,<br/><br/>The tabletop game definitely has some fun gamist elements (dice manipulation, resource management) that don't intrude too much on immersive play at the table, but don't sound like they'd be possible in a LARP setting. Heck, if rolling a couple of dice in a LARP is a big deal, I can't see anyone rolling a hlaf dozen or more to resolve a hazard. <br/><br/>The tabletop game also focuses only on the recently-returned expedition members. The mechanics often stand in for the audience of other Committee members who are listening to your tales in the SIS, but these folks are never actually given a voice. I could see a LARP experience where some players take on the roles of these other people and directly interact with and question the expedition members, maybe with acclaim rewards coming from the listeners. After all, how do we know that they're not just making it all up as they go along ; )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85011/#Comment_85011" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T12:05:11+00:00" title="August  2, 2007 12:05PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i think what you are desiring from Comitee is actually really well suited to a larp.

What a LARP is really good at is people standing around in costume and arguing about things that no one has to actually be looking at.

Each player trying to impress the others. When you want to challenge another player, to cut his story down, you pass him a coin and ask a pointed question. If he can roll with it and work your complication into the story, he keeps the coin. If he can't he gives it back. It's a simple mechanic that tests people's ability to improvise. <br/><br/>I haven't read your rules to know how the stories are judged among the audience, so I don't know how helpful this concept is. Still, tokens could be quite useful as a currency of resolution. <br/><br/>"If I hand you two tokens I win."<br/><br/>"If I hand you three I win and we part company, never to speak on this matter again."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85043/#Comment_85043" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T13:24:15+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  1:24PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Russell,<br/><br/>The game was actually one of my major inspirations and I've got optional rules for play in a very similar vein.
