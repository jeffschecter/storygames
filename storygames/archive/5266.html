(Still can't remember rules to strategy games very well.) So, I find myself wanting to use a calculator in order to GM my own game, especially in high tension situations where stopping to work out division by hand will sap the excitement.<br/><br/>By way of explanation: The GM bids against the players, splitting between attacking them and defending himself.. They can pay a token to force him to split his bid into two pieces, one of which can be no more than twice the other. Essentially maxing out at 1/3 on one side, 2/3's on the other as a max. Originally, I thought about adjusting the economics but this seemed like it was a penalty to the players, preventing them from adding in smaller values after reaching a cutoff, possibly wasting those lower value stats. After all, it's only the GM who needs to balance his bidding.<br/><br/>Is this a deal breaker? Are there gamers out there who already expect to divide by 3 when calculating numbers reaching as high as into the 80s and 90s? Do you ever use a calculator when GMing? Is it better for me to change the rules to simplify the split?<br/><br/>Be seeing you . . .                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118760/#Comment_118760" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T08:51:20+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  8:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've always had a rule of thumb that addition is fine, subtraction is less fine and division and multiplication are right out.

They then split up the values between Attack (how bad they want to win) and Defense (how bad they want to not get hurt by the risk.) This is done in secret. The numbers are then revealed and compared. A player's attack higher than the GM's defense means he gets what he wants; hitting the GM character, winning more game currency, etc. A player's attack below the GM's defense is denied. Vice versa for the GM's numbers, except the GM doesn't gain more game currency. His bid is always spent and gone. <br/><br/>What's to stop someone going all out on one side or the other? Nothing except their own desires. Part of the game is reading the situation and the GM, like a poker game. How much will he stand to lose, how much could he gain. Going all out one way or the other is going to cost someone dearly. <br/><br/>BUT, to prevent stonewalling early in the game, the players have Cover tokens. These keep the GM unaware of the player's actions in game, so he can't try too hard to either hurt them or block them. Hence the limit on the split.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118785/#Comment_118785" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T09:56:15+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  9:56AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geez!  What kind of gamers are you guys?  That's not bad, even if it is just division, which it isn't.<br/><br/>Russ, I think the problem will be solved if you rephrase your rules.  You said they're bidding poker chips, right?  What about "for every 2 chips bid on defense 1 must be bid on attack" or "The GM can not bid more than twice as many" or some such.  Multiplication is easier than division.<br/><br/>Also, if there is a limit to the GMs resources (even a practical limit) you could just put the possibilities onto a table and save the players from having to make any calculation at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118813/#Comment_118813" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T11:14:23+00:00" title="January  9, 2008 11:14AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The table idea had crossed my mind.

My real concern is using those cover tokens to limit the GM from blasting the players early.
