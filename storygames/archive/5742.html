We have rough schedules once the design bits near completion and drop dead dates for fiddling with the text.  We've only commissioned art once, and we did that pretty early in the process, about 9 months before going to press*.  We do layout and editing in-house.  Fonts are important to us.  From a design perspective I keep all my drafts, and we're moving to a formal versioning system for future projects.

That'll be changing some in the future, but for the new, it remains so.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically put our products move through a few stages those are, in order, listed below.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Concept<br/>\n2) Writing<br/>\n3) Play Test<br/>\n4) Design Elements<br/>\n5) Layout<br/>\n6) Production<br/>\n7) Web Implementation<br/>\n8) Marketing Roll Out<br/>\n<br/>\n1) At company meetings, new game concepts are thrown into the mix all the time. Of those concepts already there, we attempt to prioritize them on the basis of time to take them from concept to roll out, and also we consider what they will do strategically for us. And occasionally a project gets prioritized highly simply because its someone's pet project and they just want to do it. Anyway, at the concept stage, the game idea is born and the proposed production format is created. The proposed production format gets run through a mathmatical ringer to make sure it is both "possible" and "cost effective" to produce and then a target MSRP is established.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Entering the writing stage, we tend not to have schedules. I know, its very wierd to be running a company full time and not have production schedules. But we've found in the past that trying to force products into production schedules has several negative affects. The game design can suffer, layouts get rushed and or the products gets a poor marketing rollout. All of which should be avoided. So instead each game designer here has a plate full of projects that they work on, which they work on however they see fit, sometimes switching back and forth between projects when they get close to burn out on one, they jump to another. Most typically the design and writing are handled by just one person, though occasionally we bounce ideas off each other.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example of a multi project workflow, the design projects I'm involved with right now are: 1483 Online: Full World edition, Dark Realms Epic Adventure Game (RPG core three books), Grunt 3rd Edition: Random Battlefields sourcebook, Empires of History: WWII (board game), Crete (board game), Hundred Years War (board game), The Mongol Hordes (board game) and lastly, Rising Empires (massively huge, empire builder game).<br/>\n<br/>\nBruce is working on Heroes Forever: Detroit (RPG), Heroes Forever: Bad Asses (RPG), Heroes Forever: Lords of Order (RPG), Pantheons Online, The Cursades (board game), Sparticus (board game) and also working on the tweaks to bring the Vietnam War and African 30 Years War up from older editions to new editions, to match our newer production style.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we've got Jason doing a complete redesign of the Button Wars game, preparing the game for its evolutionary shift when it gets released as Empires &amp; Overlords, hopefully by the fall of this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nOften projects are simply completed as we get the passion to complete them. Occasionally one is put on the top of the pile for strategic importance, which is currently the case with Empires of History: WWII for me. Simply because the game is about 4 years late, we have a bunch of folks with pre orders eagerly waiting for it and strategically, getting it out will be the best thing for the Guild. Though Crete is a small little game that expect will still end up done first.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Once the game rules are written and basic sketch works done (for board games, you need a basic sketch of the board and pieces in order to move into the play test stage), the game can go into play testing. The first round of testing is a simple edit check. The manuscript and other sketched elements are passed around internally for everyone else to see and poke holes through, to catch any rules or presentation problems. Its amazing how many times the initial designer will miss a small thing here or there that can be caught be this simple review process. Once that review is done, a couple copies are printed off and sent off to our two external play test groups. They are given a chance to sit down and play the game and poke any additional holes and to provide feedback on game play and the utility value of game components. When all of this feedback is taken in, rewrites and tweaks to the designs are done as needed to fix problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Design Elements are usually done at the same time the play test copies are out. This means gather the neccesary artwork, commissioning it out where needed, doing it internally where we can. Maps are made. Book covers are designed. Game box wraps are designed. I almost always do the maps and Bruce almost always does the box wraps. Book layouts and book covers we tend to split up, depending on who is more available.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Once the play tests are done and the edits from that are done, the rules go into layout, as do any game charts, etc. If any substantial changed, we may need to go back and tweak small elements of the box wraps, covers, etc. But not often and these tweaks only take a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) As final pieces of a game exit the layout stage, they get handed off for production. Pieces get printed as they are completed and once all the elements of a game are completed, they go into packaging. Eric and Jason handle this stuff day to day, but when a big new board game needs packaging its first run or a large reprint, sometimes Bruce and I get ropped into helping. Packaging a big board game that has lots of components is rather a fair bit of work.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Also, once a game exists the layout stage, rules and art elements are handed over to me for web design. The game is given web pages and made available for sale online. I'm typically behind schedule on this and games can go through the printing stage within a week or less (or a couple of hours for small games), so we often end up with printed games a month or two before they go up for sale online. During this time, we strive to make them available for order by our retailers who place orders during that time gap, giving our retailers a jump start on selling them. We do wish we could speed up the process of making them for sale online, but, well, I wear many hats and my web design sometimes needs to take a back seat to other things I have to do. I don't expect that to change. I figure our web design process will both speed up and expand greatly once we grow a bit more and can afford to hire on a full time web designer....though we're still a small company, so I expect they'll likely have to wear the hats of web design and online marketing manager. lol. Something for the future anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Once the product has a web page, then press releases go out, all of our lists are updated, and opportunities to market the game in a wide variety of ways begin.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour other questions....<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery scrap of game design notes and scribbings are saved. If ever we have to defend our ownership of a particular intellectual property in court, all of that stuff may come in handy. I still have the original penciled paper sketches for map designs and such from 1994. Same for original game mechanic notes for our Dark Realms and WHAT RPGs. We have one drawer in a filing cabinet reserved specifically for folders of this stuff for each game that we design.<br/>\n<br/>\nEditing....is, well, not our strong suite. None of us are good editors and we don't have a staff editor. Previous attempts at using freelance editors had veeeery bad outcomes. lol. So right now editing mistakes are caught when the docs are passed around the staff internally and we all mark what sticks out to us. Our play testers do the same, though its not their job so they don't focus much on it. Just point out anything that is glaring. Since we POD/Short run all of our games, we are also blessed with the ability to continue to make small editing improvements as pesky little errors pop up from one printing to the next.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

Do you employ software to track milestones?</b><br/>\nI have a schedule that certain things need doing but use no software to track.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Do you have a task list? Is it a file on your computer, or is it written?</b><br/>\nI do have a check list of thing that need to be done in a specific order. It sits right next to my monitor to remind me what needs doing<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>If your document contains illustrations, are they commissioned before the game is designed, or afterwards, or while the text is being written?</b><br/>\nIllustrations are done once the text has gelled enough for playtest. I have to have something fairly concrete before I have artist drawing the ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Do you handle the layout yourself?</b><br/>\nI do the layout myself<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><br/>\nIs the choice of fonts a significant decision for you, or is it an afterthought?</b><br/>\nA big choice. Like artwork and layout this helps convey the feel you\u2019re going for in the game<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Do you keep your notes and scribblings for future reference?</b><br/>\nYes. I have a book that I put ideas into and I have a \u201cbible\u201d that I refer to from time to time to make sure I\u2019m still on track with the original concept. Its very easy to stray once you get going so I periodically have to check in with the good book to see if I\u2019m still on point<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>How do you handle proofreading and editing?</b><br/>\nI am constantly looking over the work and making tweaks. I have a proffer and an editor to do the final read through and corrections.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Is there a final playtesting stage, once the artifact is created?</b><br/>\nYes. Do as much as you can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128561/#Comment_128561" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T10:12:41+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 10:12AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br><br>I made a <a href="http://socratesrpg.blogspot.com/2006/04/what-is-troys-12-step-process.html" rel="nofollow">Blog Post</a> on this a while ago.
