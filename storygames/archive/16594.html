I'm all about trying to figure out what makes Story Games fun for people who don't normally role-play, and what turns them off. As a case study, I'll be talking about my friend Lucy, who has played two games with us now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first was completely freeform, we made a story situation based around a map of Redwall, the mouse kingdom (think mouseguard). We made Characters, who had no stats/traits/rules of any kind, and played a game where ideas where accepted and situations escalated or resolved based on the story's dramatic needs alone. Lucy got stuck in more than everybody else, playing her Character with gusto, getting herself into trouble, the works. Awesome!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second game Lucy played was Lady Blackbird. Interestingly, giving Lucy a bunch of traits and keys and secrets, and a way of gaining 'points', seemed to break the game for her. She felt hampered by the Character's statistics - telling her that her Character could do X made her feel like she couldn't do anything else. She was playing the traits instead of the Character - she stopped making "What would my Character do?" choices, instead moving to a "I could help because I can charm" position, and very-often even asking "can we find somebody to charm?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI've had the same leap with other Players.<br/>\nIn contrast to Lucy is her b/f Neal, who is overwhelmed by the brevity of choice in a completly freeform game. He needs a list of his Characters capabilities in order to give him 'permission' to make up certain kinds of things. I mean, in a freeform game, he could invent something which his Character would do, but he's afraid that it'll be 'wrong' unless there are rules to back it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can we marry these two forms of Player? How can we create a system that does not restrict players like Lucy, and yet offers permission to pretend to players like Neale? Does anybody have similar experiences?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'm new to the forum - this is my first post - so "Hi! Let's make sweet music together."<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ed (liverpool, UK)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379796/#Comment_379796" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T01:37:08+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  1:37AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2012 1:38AM by ivan.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            thought experiment:<br/><br/>what would happen if you gave players totally different character sheets, then you as GM ran the mechanics?<br/>each sheet would be designed to appeal to that particular character personality and bring out the best from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379798/#Comment_379798" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T02:13:33+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  2:13AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've noticed the kind of thing, too, where putting skills or traits or whatnot on a character sheet limits what the player has the character do. In some games, giving the traits values will lead people to always try to use their highest trait no matter what the situation, because that's what the game encourages, which leads to very one-dimensional play. I've had a lot of success stripping away all specific traits like that and playing (and designing) games where the characters don't have those kinds of attributes.<br/><br/>The other way around I haven't noticed as much. It might be because I haven't played with that sort of player, or because the behavior is harder to notice. Was Neal a roleplayer or a newbie? Because I can imagine this would be more of a problem for an experienced roleplayer who has always had these traits to fall back on and now suddely doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo" title="Edmoo"><img alt="Edmoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo">Edmoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379804/#Comment_379804" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T04:15:04+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  4:15AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2012 4:15AM by Edmoo.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>each sheet would be designed to appeal to that particular character personality and bring out the best from it.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>That's a cool idea.

Lady Blackbird doesn't have numbered traits though - to strip it down further you'd have to remove tags from traits and make them more 'amorphous'.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering weather giving traits that are based on behaviors might be the problem here - Since a Player decides a Characters behavior's, telling them "you behave like this" (to use the above example, "you can charm people") might give them less creative flexibility than telling them something like 'you are really good with people', since that 'allows' them to charm, empathise, manipulate...<br/>\nSkills being clear but unspecific leaves them to decide the exact nature of their action.</p>\n<p>I'm also thinking that the number of traits and keys Lucy was given might have been confusing to her. Her character had 5 traits, each with several tags, and three keys, and she was trying to play them all. Might be easier if you had about three 'trait/keys'.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379817/#Comment_379817" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T09:41:51+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  9:41AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The deeper selling point of Lady Blackbird, The Shadow of Yesterday, The World of Near, is the traits and keys.<br/><br/>What most players struggle with is that exchange of keys.

A simple system that builds up over time could help make concrete what they want to do might be helpful. <br/><br/>In a game I'm working on, Heart of the Rose, players create allies and parts of the world by just writing them down on an index card. Then these things can be interacted with via the mechanics. It's reminiscent of traits in Breaking the Ice, which the players start with a couple, then add to over time as they will. Just writing something down might make it feel more official.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380035/#Comment_380035" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T06:41:46+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  6:41AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way to view the problem is to ask "What IS the character to the player?"<br/><br/>In Nates case I guess the answer would be like<br/>A character is a person represented in the gaming system with stats and traits to represent how they interact with the world. Hence Nate prefer to have a system level of the character to interact with the character in the game. The system might even "be" the character for Nate, and how the character behaves is a representation of the number. (Not the other way around)<br/><br/>In Lucys case I guess the answer might be:<br/>The character is a  person living n another world that she going to roleplay. She going to pretend to be the person, and while pretending to be the person, she want to be able to reason the same way a normal person would do. Act in whatever way seems fitting to the character in any giving situation.  Because Lucy is a person, she want to use the same kind of thinking when her character makes choices, as when she makes choices. Because that how person normally makes choices.<br/>For Lucy the level of abstraction of traits and system to describe the character makes no sense at all. She can't really understand where the character sheet and traits com into her playing scheme of "Presenting to be another person". They not only a way to only a way to describe the character. They describe what you can do. She not sure how to fit that together with her earlier playing scene of being able to do whatever seems reasonable in the situation.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>But this is just guesses.
