The first one is May 10th (not coincidentally the same day Game Chef launches). It is co-organized by <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/53124/sam-liberty" rel="nofollow">myself</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MegGameologists/" rel="nofollow">Meg of Brilliant Gameologists</a>. Designers and playtesters are extremely welcome. We'll be focusing on new RPG systems developed by members. The plan is to run "scenes" in as many of the alpha game systems as possible to get the games in shape for an open beta (PDF) in the near future.<br/><br/>It costs nothing to attend, and nothing to become a member of the GMG. Hope to see some of you there!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
