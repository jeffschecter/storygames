Or, at least, it's always been like that (EDIT: i mean, for me). On this forum, there's a lot of people who *do* game, and they get a lot of satisfaction by it... but there's also a lot of people who complains about not gaming enough (if at all). And sometimes, i've seen, circumstances just seem to do their best to really, really, really, prevent you from gaming. More or less Fiasco-like, I'd say.<br/><br/>I want to hear of that time you had managed to schedule a night of good games, and a Deus Ex Machine came and took it away from you. I want to hear it because it's amusing, and because i'm quite convinced it happens to everybody, from time to time. <br/><br/>For me, in this *very* moment: After buying it at Lucca Comics and Games, in November, i finally managed to get some people together to play Shock:<br/><br/>Obviously, the book has disappeared, and is nowhere to be found.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/runiq" title="runiq"><img alt="runiq" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/034/1/6/the_octopus__tiny__by_runiq-d38qjk5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/runiq">runiq</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307640/#Comment_307640" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T09:06:08+00:00" title="January 10, 2011  9:06AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aww, that sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2019twas the day before New Year\u2019s Eve, we had a session of AD&amp;D all set up, characters with elaborate, interesting backstories, and a new key mechanic I was eager to try out.

This evening for example: canceled a couple of hours before the meeting time because of a last-minute work problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there is single canceled game session that I will always remember. It was the very last session of a long campaign. The session was centered to the solving of a long delayed quest for a player character. It was the last one for that group of character (I was still very much into illusionism at that time, I had prepared everything in advance. I am talking about more than ten years ago)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the player of that central character was late. Without him there was no game, so after a while I called him by phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe phone rang a lot, I was about to stop the call when someone answered. It was the player's brother. They were at the hospital, the family was called because the player had a frontal, collision with a car. And he was driving a motorbike.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it would have been very doubtful that that player would have survived the night. The doctors already told the brothers to be prepared to talk to their parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I can talk easily about it because that player DIDN'T die, he is still alive and well. He was in coma for a few days and after that it took months of training, but he fully recovered. But at the time...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player continued to play in our group (after a few months of recovery) but we never played that last session....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307756/#Comment_307756" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-11T07:01:46+00:00" title="January 11, 2011  7:01AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2011 7:08AM by Suna.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me cancelling game sessions was the norm until I eventually gave up and a series of circumstances lead me to actually stop wanting to play due to a series of unnerving situations I've been experiencing. Until the "crisis" eventually faded away and I even managed to find two people willing to commit to a game on regular basis (and have long games, not just one-shots or coiti interrupti I had been having all along). I don't know if it will change.<br><br>But sometimes it's just more relaxing to play boardgames to me. None of the squabbling you constantly see in rpgs, they play out smoothly (unless they're really badly designed), they're meant to be one session longs (ok, I've heard of multi-sessions long boardgames, but that's a perversion in its aethimological sense). And lo! There are lots of boardgames that are just great, especially in recent times.<br>So my suggestion is: if your experience is similar to mine, boardgames might be the answer if you enjoy them, like I do.<br><br>Also, on actual play. I've seen it turn into an obsession beyond what I believe it was meant to be. There's people who will refuse to talk unless via AP even in smaller, totally secondary topics. You know what? So long as your hypotesis, questions and reasoning is to the point and reasonably concrete, I don't give a damn about actual play.<br>Just beware not to end up in abstractness that can't be solved unless it is via actual play. That's when I see its worth and want to see it kick in.<br>I just can't stand it when things degenerate into mere dogma.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307777/#Comment_307777" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-11T09:45:45+00:00" title="January 11, 2011  9:45AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2011 6:14PM by Moreno R..">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>There's people who will refuse to talk unless via AP even in smaller, totally secondary topics.</blockquote>\nYes, I am one of them.<br><br>I simply wasted too much precious time of my life trying to understand what people "meant", bending over and trying anything to solve some mess of dubious reasoning, until at last I understood that if people don't use actual play example, it's because they DON'T WANT you to understand.

How the hell a hurricane made it up into the Champlain Valley, I'll never understand. Nonetheless, it happened.<br/><br/>Now, upstate New York - in Adirondack Park - is a pretty rural place for the most part. My grandparents owned a cabin up on Lake George, with direct access to the lake. Great place. Nice and quiet, secluded, surrounded by trees...it was beautiful and serene. A great place to relax.<br/><br/>Except when there's a hurricane, of course. Power was out pretty much everywhere. In some places - like my grandparent's cabin - it was out for a <i>week.</i> And, of course, it wasn't just the power outage that was the problem. This is a rural mountain town we're talking about. Trees were down everywhere, cutting off entire roads. And of course, there being so few roads to begin with, this made the isolated mountain town <i>even more</i> isolated.<br/><br/>It was in that cabin, after the hurricane had come through, that we played the first session of what would become a 5-year long AD&amp;D campaign. We played in a secluded cabin, in the midst of an emergency situation, with no power, surrounded by downed trees and blocked roads, by the light of a single Coleman lantern. And it was <i>awesome.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
