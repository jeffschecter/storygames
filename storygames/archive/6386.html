Obviously he didn't answer ALL the questions asked of him, but when he could, he did.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother company was almost impenetrable. I ran their entire organised play for half the world and I was never able to speak to anyone other than a single member of staff. Playtests were top, top secret. Noboby knew anything apart from the official line.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuess which company was held in the highest contempt by the players? Yup, it was the open company. The designer, sadly passed away now, was wholly LOATHED by the player base. The financial and marketing decisions of the company were questioned in the finest minutae and indeed a number of players quit the game stating their disagreement with the companies business practices as being the reason. The closed company, despite their product being perennially late, their promotions being dire and their communication being virtually zero, was simply ... there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think of this and harken back to the days when I just went down to the local games shop, looked over the shelves, saw what was new and bought it. I never realised when a game was late to market. I never thought about whether it was a trad-game or an indie-game. I certainly didn't think to ever contact the designer, speak to the company or try to influence the way the game developed. In some ways these were simpler, happier times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre we too close to the flame?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr are we just selective in the way that we use this more readily available 'inside information' to inform our purchases? Are we breeding a generation of ethically conscious games consumers or are we just 'giving it to the man' because we have found a weak spot in his armour?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I think it is probably the latter. After all, I have yet to see (direct me if I am wrong) anyone questioning a company about the policy they have on say, recycled and/or sustainable paper for printing, the use of vegetable inks, whether they bank with a sound financial institution, what their policies are on childcare, healthcare, work-life balance or maternity/paternity rights?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat implications does this have for independent publishers? Are their business practices going to come under similar scrutiny?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is this just a case of using the information that is presented as and when it is presented?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nNeil                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141226/#Comment_141226" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T04:45:53+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  4:45AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post, Neil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141227/#Comment_141227" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T04:47:22+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  4:47AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a good question.

I certainly wouldn't be anywhere near the position I am now without the openness and support of the people on this board and especially Collective Endeavour.  Its very true that no man is an island and we can all learn from each others experiences - good or bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the question then arises - why one rule for one and one rule for another? Do we gain/expect/create an exemption from certain business practices because we are independent? Does it not matter as much? And if thats true does it mean that we have a fundamentally different producer/consumer relationship than the readily available model?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan we identify the issues that will be the deal breakers for purchasers of independent games?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's an example. I am aware that some people have very strong views about the payment of artists and the need to respect their contribution and skills for the value it is worth. The artist for Duty &amp; Honour simply refused to take payment for his work. He was more than happy to have some exposure and he took such pleasure from illustrating in the genre that he couldn't bring himself to charge me. I eventually did do some quid pro quo stuff for him and landed a massive bottle of vodka on his lap but, essentially, my art is free barring a small opportunity cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould someone choose not to buy my game, even if they were interested, because on face value it could be said that I have exploited my artist friend?<br/>\n<br/>\nPossibly. However I don't think thats going to be taken anywhere near as seriously as the WotC licence thing. We really do seem to be more willing to bend the rules for independents more than the corporates.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find it all fascinating, almost from an academic point of view, however it would be useful if we could identify those deal breakers in the independent side of things?<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141230/#Comment_141230" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T06:01:11+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  6:01AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the internet and the collapse of the information float has its hands in that as well. Back in the days when communication was all by letter, and we found out what was new when it appeared in the store, we didn't have all that visibility into various companies. They could run fine, or run themselves into the ground, and we'd never know until the company came out with, or stopped coming out with, their latest products.<br><br>These days, we have forums; we have forums about that company on the company's website. We have enthusiastic people who hit refresh every day on their favorite company forums to see what products they're working on, what they're talking about, amassing knowledge about what's going on under the hood... and we also have the internet cranks with too much free time on their hands, who feel that they are owed private knowledge, and when given some of it they use it to promote whatever halfassed conclusions they'd already reached.<br><br>When you think about it, it's the same as the movie industry, or anime industry, or comic industry before the internet (although of those three, the comic industry had the most "pen traffic" before the internet, I'd wager).<br><br>Personally, I'm with Pramas: In this day and age, it makes sense to go open, or stay closed, but not some halfway stance between the two. I'd prefer it'd been closed until they figured it all out, then released it to the community, rather than the halfassed "sorta open/sorta closed; every employee has their own take/model on how it should/might work", etc. <br><br>And it seems that they're feeling harassed, or at least pressured, by the fanbase to talk about this stuff more: Fans will be fans, both the enthusiastic ones and the cranks. WOTC should be used to it by now. A policy of going Closed wouldn't do any more harm (to themselves, anyway) until they got all their shit sorted out. Or, a policy of going Open, through a few spokespeople/articles, then completely ignoring the buzz generated by those comments (letting the enthusiastic fans stew, and not giving any more food to the cranks) would have been a less stressful stance to take.<br><br>These are interesting days.<br><br>Personally, as a fan and consumer, I plug my ears as much as possible to prevent getting influenced by incorrect speculation. It also enhances the surprise of the final product. It's the reason I'm trying to stay away from IRON MAN trailers before they reveal like the whole goddamn movie in a series of 1-minute clips. :-)<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141231/#Comment_141231" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T06:05:28+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  6:05AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite><br>I think of this and harken back to the days when I just went down to the local games shop, looked over the shelves, saw what was new and bought it.

But so far, I haven't seen an example here in this thread. I at least wouldn't consider it "exploitation" when your artist friend refuses to be payed for his artwork beyond credit and booze. And, personally, if WotC would start to illustrate their products solely by people who willingly give them their artwork for exposure (and booze), I wouldn't mind either.

On the other hand, there are some "real corporations" that do these things worse then most independents, so dunno...<br><br>But using art your friend gives you for free isn't an example of that, IMO.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141238/#Comment_141238" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T06:26:02+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  6:26AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neil, fantastic post! <br><br>Lots to consider.

But thats what I am fishing for - are there deal breakers in the indie movement which would cause the same levels of annoyance to potential customers? Maybe our openness about things helps iron these thing out. After all, I have 'fessed up regarding Peter and his art and explained the situation. If that had just come out as 'Don't buy that Duty &amp; Honour game, the designer didn't pay the artist a penny for the artwork!' it might have been different. It would have been true as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nDistribution is a great example. We tolerate a far tighter distribution system for independent games than we do for corporately produced games. This isn't a deal breaker for the sector. Its accepted and (as I understand it) is one of the ways that indie games are allowed to prosper - by using a different distribution model.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrint quality is another one maybe? I know that Mongoose have been taken to task recently for the quality of their printing and this has resulted in some people not buying Mongoose products. Has there been an indie game which has been wholesale rejected for poor (or poor in comparison to Mongoose) quality? Are any poorly produced books tolerated or lauded?<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141242/#Comment_141242" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T07:00:04+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  7:00AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2008 7:01AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neil, there definitely are people who feel very strongly about compensation for artists (I'm one), and the glory and the curse of transparency is that you will hear from them.  The cool thing is that your artist can defend his own decisions in an equally public way, which he will probably have to.  I'd actually like to see that discussion between artists.

You can read official publications, such as articles, interviews, and press releases, and you can read unofficial information like blog posts and message board threads (though these are obviously far less reliable). Sales figures, revenues and profits, and development status (announced, late, cancelled) are all presented for public consumption, and work-in-progress demos and videos are easily accessed if you're interested.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, most gamers don't care. I'm convinced of that. Of the millions of people who bought Rock Band or Call of Duty 4, few can tell you who developed the game (though some can identify the publisher), or what the significance of the developer-publisher relationship is. This information is out there, but most gamers just aren't that interested.<br/><br/>I'm of the opinion that the readership of online news sites, such as RPG.net, is pretty marginal. Of the millions of people that will buy D&amp;D 4E publications this year, relatively few of them will have read about it on RPG.net or EN World or whatever, and few of them will actually know about the development process.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the indie scene doesn't have the presence or the marketing budget of a larger publisher. Indie games don't sell millions of units. We rely on the Internet to get the word out. When the first edition of Dread was released in 2002, I sold pretty much every copy due to a few posts and reviews at RPG.net and The Forge. No one else knew about the game unless they met me at a con. Though the playing field has changed, the indie scene is still fairly dependent on that customer-developer relationship.<br/><br/>I guess the point that I'm trying to make (with an alarming lack of factual data to back it up) is that a larger proportion of indie game consumers are involved in the discussions about indie game development. Does that make sense?<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141271/#Comment_141271" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T09:05:16+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  9:05AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2008 9:05AM by Rafael.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Hitler Shitcock!</blockquote>\nQFT!<br/><br/>I think the other side to JDCorley's post would be, "No matter how unpleasant you are, someone thinks you're pretty cool."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141276/#Comment_141276" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T09:26:54+00:00" title="April 25, 2008  9:26AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that is also true.

Seriously, look at the number of 'I quit' threads that pop up around each patch and/or expansion, based on the perceived 'screwing' each player is getting by Blizzard.

The real trick would be whether we knew if these people were also the primary decision-makers for their playgroups and peer groups? Do they act as gatekeepers for information and opinion? If they do, then these dealbreakers might be more important than just a slack handful of copies.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, if it came to light that a game had only had a single playtest before publication, how many people would buy it 'blind' or recommend it to a friend?

I say minority, because I guarantee you that the number of people posting on those WoW forums, and reading others' posts, is <i>considerably</i> less than ten million.

I believe that most of those consumers will never visit the web sites of the developers whose games they purchase, let alone register on the forums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141298/#Comment_141298" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T11:37:21+00:00" title="April 25, 2008 11:37AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite>For example, if it came to light that a game had only had a single playtest before publication, how many people would buy it 'blind' or recommend it to a friend?

Both games (Raw Deal and B5) lost their licences and are no longer in production. I reckon they both did equally well commercially. Maybe a little more on RD (the one that was open) by virtue of the licence. The debate has sort of moved on from that point but I'll revisit it because I don't think I made the point I actually intended to make. Namely, an awful lot of people exhausted an awful lot of emotional energy and angst towards RD because it was open with its operations, whereas the reaction to B5 was equally loyal but with a fraction of the bile. The daily drama was almost as much a part of the playing experience as playing the game. However for many people, it was too much and I honestly believe it weakened the experience for them. The game was less important than the soap opera that was the fan interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats what I meant in the original post about being too close to the flame.

Each company described above was approaching publicity in a different manner. The closed company used an air of mystery and impregnable importance while the open company used a "friendly, open" approach, both of which are simply what the more odious pundits might call "spin." <br>\n<br>\nThe real question is two fold: which approach was ethically sound and which approach helped the company meet its bottom line?<br>\n<br>\nThe open and honest-seeming game designer died, we are told, but how did the game do? Was it a financial success? Did that matter to the designer as much as other concerns?<br>\n<br/>\nThe closed game had loyal fans, was that because it simply gave people what they want? How well did it do? Were those involved comfortable with the business they did?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know. Certainly there is some strategic merit to keeping secrets, but it would seem the package is often just as important as the product, especially where a vice like gaming is concerned. Sometimes word-of-mouth is the packaging and sometimes its simply clever guerilla marketing. <br/>\n<br/>\nGuerilla marketing is actually the problem. Story games designers cannot afford to take a direct approach, they are not as mighty as their competition (I mean HASBRO? You got the chops to go up against HASBRO? Since most story games are self-published or small print runs, even Steve Jackson Games can give them a run for their money.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you play to your niche. You expand your niche, either by playing it canny and acting like a resistance movement or going to your fan base and involving them in the process. It comes down to the personality of the game and the designer. I know that sounds like a cop-out, but, really, the secret of guerilla marketing is always to find the thing that people aren't doing and do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is it really a question between disclosure and open content? No, that's someone else guiding your argument. What's the option you're not being offered? What is it that nobody's mentioning? What can you do that the more powerful companies either don't care about or can't see? That's what you've got to tell people.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I rather think its games like Prime Time Adventures and With Great Power... that have the most promising "message" and each other game system, whether it's Life with Master or the Secret Lives of Gingerbreadmen will have to reach out to its audience in its own weird way... and it better be weird, relative to the audience, or the big guys will already have gotten it covered. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest of luck. Each game's gotta find its own niche. I hope this makes sense.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_141344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141344/#Comment_141344" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-25T23:08:38+00:00" title="April 25, 2008 11:08PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Arpie&lt;/cite&gt;<br/>\nGuerilla marketing is actually the problem. Story games designers cannot afford to take a direct approach, they are not as mighty as their competition &lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say, I disagree. If you consider the smaller market, the identifiable gatekeepers, the propensity to embrace 'the new awesome', the broadbased acceptance of social networking and the heavy use of internet communications amongst many in the Story Games world, I think it would be pretty damned easy to do a form of guerilla marketing campaign. The problem would lie in the other side of the equation - the community is just that, a community and they rarely look pleasantly on members performing obfuscation on them. Sure, some people can get away with it but others will be called on it and their word forever questioned - the designer who cried wolf.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, if you look at say Luke Crane's tactics in the run up to the announcement of Blossoms, he used a number of information-leak and tease techniques to grab the interest of his devoted board-goers and by osmosis, that interest spread beyond the board to other interested gamers. I'm aware of something called Project Donut? I have no idea what it is or even who is involved but its name keeps cropping up somewhere and it has a Facebook fan page. I'm intrigued. Thats the mysterious, silent side of PR.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the open, vocal side of PR, I would look to the Evil Hat guys and their treatment of the Dresden Files RPG. The very open and accessible way that this is being presented has really hooked me in - and I'm not a massive fan of either the books or the show. The revelation that SotC was a beta document for the system? Well, that was, imo, brave and outrageously audacious. And it worked (for me). I'd also look to the way Eric Provost has handled the development of Red Box Hack. Never has the term 'Open Playtest' been so true. RBH has a life of its own - its more like a living game than a game in development.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, all of these examples validate the rest of your post. They have indeed, played to their niche. Luke plays to the reputation of BW, Evil Hat play to their reputation as fan-friendly communicators and Eric taps the broadminded acceptance of Story Gamers to love the new awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlvin also said:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Arpie&lt;/cite&gt;<br/>\nWhat can you do that the more powerful companies either don't care about or can't see? That's what you've got to tell people.<br/>\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThats excellent. Thats really the crux of the positive spin to come from this thread. Yes, we have a load of information and yes, sometimes we obsess on that information and yes, that has changed the way we interact with games and games designers. However for independent games designers that gives us a chance to do things that the bigger companies cannot. Its easier for us to manage the initial flow of information and to respond personally to queries or misconceptions. We can be far more transparent about our operations and our production methods and therefore answer any ethical questions that may arise. We can help each other to identify potential weaknesses and to solve those weaknesses. We can present evidence - like AP, playtest reports and development blogs - in such a way as to placate any qualms that people might have about the integrity of our games. Indie games can, and do, exploit the information rich arena of the internet (and its kissing cousin, word of mouth) in this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if thats blindingly obvious to everyone else but its answered an itching query (about the validity to this information deluge on our experiences) in a very interesting way. Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the thread - I appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil<br/>\n<br/>\nps.

I'd still like to meet those people face to face to hopefully prove myself wrong, though.

They are both the tip of the gaming iceberg and the shop front of public opinion for a game. I readily accept that the, say, 10,000 users of the WoW forums are a tiny fraction of the total player base but essentially the other 8,990,000 are 'Schroedingers Gamer' - until they find a way to speak you don't know whether they are pleased with the game or secretly despise it and everything inbetween.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I'm not saying that open development and the fan hubub that it can cause are a generic bad thing. I'm sure Eric isn't crying into his pint about the amount of hugely positive posts, blogs and AP that RBH has received in the last few months?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe its a case of ownership. Citing Eric again, one thing that I have always been certain of from the get-go is that RBH is his baby and whilst we can play it, report on it and generally suggest things, those decisions are his and his alone and we have no ownership of that process. In other things - WoW, Raw Deal and some of what I have seen of 4e, there seems to be a huge degree of player-imagined ownership of the game, related to the amount of information that is readily available and the propensity for people to fill in the gaps for themselves - usually on a downside slant.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving read through this conversation now a couple of times, I'm pretty much convinced that for independent games, open development doesn't really risk the same loss of innocence and the associated angst that some of the bigger products suffer. If anything, the feedback - for good or bad - that open development creates seems more likely to nip flaws in the bud, than drive people away from the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers again for everyones contributions<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_141500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/141500/#Comment_141500" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-28T11:36:19+00:00" title="April 28, 2008 11:36AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vodkashok</cite>Thats what I meant in the original post about being too close to the flame.

Knowing about wrestling ratings or designer bios is a similar symptom to 24 news channels playing up meaningless scandals. But the flip side is that information can be useful when you're trying to do something specific with it, like design a game. Knowledge is seductive. People are generally curious and want more information about the things we like, so it's no surprise that much of it becomes open.
