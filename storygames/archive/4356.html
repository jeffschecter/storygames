First, I'm teaching high school now and it's eating my time. Second, there isn't as much actual development happening right now, because the book is getting close to ready.<br/><br/>I have one person doing a first-pass edit at the moment, after which I have a professional editor to send it to. I have a few more pieces of art coming in. I'm choosing a printer. The book and PDF <i>will</i> be out by Genericon, in January. Luckily none of this requires as much of my time as playtesting and writing, and by mid-October I should have enough time to find a printer. Suggestions in that area are welcome.<br/><br/>If you're interested in a beta copy, give me an e-mail. You have to promise to get involved, though, preferably by posting actual-play reports to the development journal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98400/#Comment_98400" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T02:50:59+00:00" title="September 23, 2007  2:50AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Colin_Fredericks</cite>The book and PDF<i>will</i>be out by Genericon, in January.

This game is smething I've been looking forward to ever since I first heard about it, because it covers a type of SciFi that I'm really into right now and that has been somewhat neglected in gaming so far.<br/><br/>As for Printer Suggestions: Dunno. Are you planning in a traditional print run (+IPR, I'd imagine) or would something like Lulu work for you? The latter would, from my purely amateur point of view, probably be less of a hassle for you in terms of time and pre-investment while being less profitable in the long run. More typical print-runs seem to be more work and need more investment, but thend to be cheaper on a per-book basis, this making them more profitable.<br/><br/>But as I said, I'm just somebody who reads about this stuff online, I never published or anything. I'm sure other people will have more helpfull advice for you. ^_^<br/><br/>As for Actual Play: Sadly, with my gaming as irregular as it is now, I can't promise you that. What I can promise, though, is to read it and try to give as much helpfull commentary as possible. (While trying to find players for some Actual Play.) So I sent you a mail anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98668/#Comment_98668" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T11:16:18+00:00" title="September 24, 2007 11:16AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.<br/><br/>Lulu might be appropriate; I'm only planning on doing a few full-color copies for myself and close friends, and the rest will be black and white.

The only game of mine I KNOW to be printed at Lulu, the Reign Hardcover, is absolutely outstanding in Quality and probably more robust then some non-POD games I've owned over the years. (I think a few other games I own have been printed at Lulu, namely Shock and TSOY, but I'm not sure if that's correct. If it is, though, both have great printing too. ^_^)<br/><br/>Another awesome thing about Lulu is that you could theoretically have both a color and a greyscale version available there and people could choose whichever they want. (Just like people can, for example, choose two different covers for Reign and, once The Troubles* are sorted out, Hard and Softcover versions.) That's IMO one of the biggest advantage of POD at Lulu.<br/><br/>*Reign has some troubles with the softcover version because one of the printers at Lulu US doesn't understand the source pdfs correctly, resulting in missprints. Because of that, there is now only a Hardcover version available (Seems that printer understand the pdfs), though Greg and Daniel are working to get that corrected, last time I've heard. Haven't heard about similar problems with other games printed at Lulu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
