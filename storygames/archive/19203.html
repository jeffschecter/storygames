One such (and the reason I'm asking) is the Hollow's Inhuman Gaze that tells you to use Dark to Shut Someone Down.  Does this mean that with the only move left for Cold being Hold Steady that highlighting someone's Cold becomes a jerk move?  Or are they allowed to use Cold anyway and ignore their move?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428064/#Comment_428064" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T07:56:18+00:00" title="February  6, 2014  7:56AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2014 7:56AM by Johnstone.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stat substitution moves can turn highlighting the wrong stat into a jerk move, yeah.<br/><br/>The Angel has a move where the stat substitution is optional, all other AW stat-sub moves are mandatory (I asked Vincent about it once). Part of the trade-off in a move like Inhuman Gaze is yeah, you get to use a better stat, but if your Cold is highlighted, you don't have a choice between which moves to make to gain XP.<br/><br/>If someone highlights a stat you no longer use at all, it really sucks, and you should let them know. Probably you should tell them about any stat-sub moves you have at all before highlighting -- someone may want to see you use Shut Someone Down a lot (and not so much Hold Steady), in which case they actually want to highlight Dark and not Cold.<br/><br/>Stat-sub moves can sometimes mean getting more XP, if you no longer use one of your stats (although the singleton rule probably cuts that down quite a bit). A possible hack to the system is highlighting the basic moves associated with a stat instead of the stat itself, so you get XP when you use the move, not the stat. It also means you don't get XP for using special moves that have roll+stat in them, though, which a group may not be down with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428079/#Comment_428079" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T12:13:39+00:00" title="February  6, 2014 12:13PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Deliverator posted this in the other thread, I think it was meant to go here?

I talked to her out of it, though I shouldn't have had to, and it certainly would have fallen under the category of "invalidating player choices."</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428097/#Comment_428097" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-07T02:00:10+00:00" title="February  7, 2014  2:00AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not jerk move unless the have no way of rolling that stat.<br/><br/>Because when I hightlight your character's hot in MH, I'm not just saying "I want to see you turn people on and manipulate NPCs", I'm also saying "I want to see your character [try to] be hot".  In AW, if you're a brainer and I mark your hot or hard, I'm saying "I know that you can get other people to do what you want with your psychic brain fuckery, but this session, maybe try it the old fashioned way".<br/><br/>MH is great in that every stat but dark is connected to two moves and there aren't any stat-sub moves for gaze into the abyss, so there's always something you can roll.  But I do wish the stat-sub moves were more conditional, so that it took an alternate or additional fictional trigger to use them (a-la the brainer's psychic go aggro) or the various werewolf moves.  In my own hack, characters roll the cool-equivalent to "dance past danger".  But if they're carrying a shield, they instead roll the hard-equivalent to "endure the blow" for the same effect.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428099/#Comment_428099" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-07T05:23:00+00:00" title="February  7, 2014  5:23AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I agree.

The first stat-sub move I ever used was in Dungeon World, for my absent-minded scientist character: "when you use logical deduction, you can <i>discern realities</i> using INT instead of WIS." It meant that instead of just saying "I examine the brass sphere to see if there are any markings on it," I was pushing myself to come up with stuff like "I set up an array of half a dozen small dish-shaped instruments, in order to determine if the sphere is emitting some sort of energy field."<br/><br/>Even if the move is just as straightforward as "when you <i>turn someone on</i>, roll +cold," I'd rather work it into the fiction. "I've got got a totally deadpan expression on my face, 'cause I don't want to let on how much I'm enjoying this." It helps me feel like the character is doing something special.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428134/#Comment_428134" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-08T11:56:24+00:00" title="February  8, 2014 11:56AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I really liked the way taking Bare Your Fangs changed my Chosen in the last game we played.

And deals with the real issue I have with the Chosen's stat spread (i.e. no ability to Hold Steady and no direct move that way).  Conditional stat changers are something I'm all in favour of - and this is the best example I've seen for why.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/godzi">@godzi</a>, my DW mage was inspired by a mix of David Attenborough and the RDJ Sherlock Holmes.
