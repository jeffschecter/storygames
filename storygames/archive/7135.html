Partly because I'm a business traveler and can't always afford to pack even the smaller books to read, partly because I'm trying to reduce consumption of paper goods.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to make a post because I know there are designers out there who read this -- and kind of wanted to hear if I was crazy on this one. I know a lot of people are interested in the artifact of their printed books but I'm at a point as a consumer where I'm making buy/no-buy decisions on a particular game based on PDF availability. And I thought that might be useful information to share, especially if there are other people with my sentiment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know piracy is a concern; has anyone in the community explored encoding data of the authorized recipient of a PDF? There are some fairly incredible things you can do, such as encoding names and purchase information in the spacing between characters.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158732/#Comment_158732" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T22:21:22+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 10:21PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's interesting (for me, at least) how my buying habits changed following the changes in my gaming habits.  Going from the "collector's" model (buying a lot of gaming books knowing that I could play less than 10% of them. only to read) to a Indie  "playing" model (I can play everything I buy now) made me go, without even thinking about it, from a "I buy only printed books, pdfs are not as pretty" to a "I would like to buy only pdf, they are much more useful to play than a printed book"<br/><br/>With a pdf I can print a copy for every player, I can write on my copy every rule change or errata, comments from forums, etc, without worrying about "ruining" it, I can print easily any play-aid without having to go to a copy store, and, last but not least, I spend less money and the author gets more money (win-win).  And it's easier to include the changes and errata from following edition (the best would be a policy of free upgrades).<br/><br/>Seeing that piracy is a issue only when you get to much higher sales (if it doesn't hurt Spirit of the Century...), and for almost unknown games like most of indie games it can even be a boost to sales, and people who get $2 or less from a retail sale at $20 can get $10 from a pdf sale without having to pay the printing money in advance, It's difficult to understand why anyone would not want to sell more pdfs than printed books...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158733/#Comment_158733" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T22:27:14+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 10:27PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Blake, let's say there's a game, you've played it, you definitely want to own it.

But the deal is that I honestly end up using most games briefly at best, as the book turns out to be "just an interesting read".<br/><br/>As such, I've switched to a "buy PDF first" mentality if the PDF is priced much less than the print book. If the book pans out and I start to use it in play a lot (or read it a lot), I'll buy the print.<br/><br/>As for DRM, though: I've never bought a DRM book and I likely never will. I don't share my PDF files and think that players should purchase their own, but DRM is simply not ready for prime time. Spinning off Jason's analogy:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>like selling a print book with a built-in padlock.</blockquote>\nIt's like selling a print book with a padlock, oh, with a key chained to your desk downstairs, and only the company that made the key can move to another desk.

Awesome question.<br/><br/>I am willing to pay more for PDFs. However (and this is an "if I had all the time in the world" thing), my idea if I ever wrote a game was to try and differentiate the paper and PDF products (if the paper product existed) by including content with the PDF that isn't in the paper book. I'm not talking about counters or character sheets (those should be available to either buyer), but honest to goodness additional content. This is a sneaky way of advocating a green agenda, also. Simple examples might be additional scenarios, more optional rules, whatever. This isn't going to agree with people who want every instance of their product to be "complete," but if you worked at it hard enough I think you'd turn up a few other options.<br/><br/>When I talk about encoding data into the PDFs, I'm not saying you should DRM it and lock it to a particular person. What I am saying is that when you sell me a PDF, it should have encoded in it, "This PDF was sold to Blake Deakin on the 26th of July, 2008." If you did so in a manner that's difficult to defeat (such as in the spacing of characters which I suggested... incidentally, this is impossible to discern to a human eye, a computer has to do it) you could recover an illegally-distributed PDF on the web and figure out who the jerk is. With a tightly-knit community like the indie RPG one, I think it would be a good deterrent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158754/#Comment_158754" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-26T07:51:53+00:00" title="July 26, 2008  7:51AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't be willing to pay more for a .pdf.

If they were to cost more to buy than the actual book, I probably wouldn't buy it. Partially because I'm chronically unemployed, so I don't exactly have a lot of wallet (and cost already factors into which games I buy), but also because it would start to feel like the same taking advantage of that results in nurses, teachers, and social workers being consistently underpaid (although obviously that's not the only reason those positions are underpaid).

Personally, if my choices are between being able to get a PDF I want with my name encoded on it, or not being able to get it at all, I'd go for the former -- for the nameless, faceless content producers in the community, I don't have a deep interest in their trust; the ones I do know, I'd think nothing of it in the first place.<br/><br/>We get things like license plates to ensure that we don't go around getting into accidents and driving off without repercussions, I guess I don't see the harm in encoding data that discourages piracy.

While some publishers may be happy to make a sale one way or the other, it is just creating more "filler" so to speak, on someone's bookshelf.  This is not to say that play is the only use game books have, but if you're buying games to mine them for ideas, it definitely seems like PDF should work just as well or better.  That's part of the reason I decided to, as with TSOY and SOTC, to make all my games available for free electronically and then release print editions on the side.  Ultimately, I suspect this will result in less waste even if it also results in less "I guess I should probably check this game out" sales.  People who buy print copies of the game are then likely to be people who actually plan to use them in play enough that an electronic version just wouldn't cut it, or they are invested enough in the game that they want a physical artifact.  This may not work for all publishers, but it makes me much happier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158768/#Comment_158768" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-26T10:45:27+00:00" title="July 26, 2008 10:45AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no problem with the "personalization" scheme Paizo and DTRPG/RPGnow use.

With convergence devices becoming prevalent, I think I'd assume that most people won't want to print paper and will instead prefer to have digital copies on them in the short to medium term. In a way, I'm not sure how your argument differs from saying you shouldn't sell hybrid cars because they might encourage people to drive more (they certainly do in some cases, but not in the majority of cases).<br/><br/>EDIT: Text modified to be less obnoxious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158781/#Comment_158781" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-26T12:29:59+00:00" title="July 26, 2008 12:29PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blake T.

You don't go through your marriage then try to get a divorce and the other person says, "Surprise!  Pre-nup!" That's the key for me.  If the seller told me upfront, "Hey, this .pdf is going to be tagged with your name and purchase data" it might not be a big deal. <br/><br/>If it's a secret tagging, I think I'd compare it to borrowing something from a friend, like a book or a dvd, then discovering he'd attached a radio ID chip to it because he thought I would steal it from him.  This is a little hyperbolic because I don't have close personal friendships with many (any) game designers, and there are only quite a small number that I have any kind of personal relationship with.  But it's the closest "real world" kind of comparison I can think of right now.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blake T.

Why alienate your customer base?

And, really, from what I know (from a lot of forum post of game author's in these threads about sales and the effect of piracy), some comments are out-of-the-world in terms on simple balance cost-benefits.<br/><br/>But let's talk about one thing at the time:<br/><br/>1) How much I would pay more for a pdf: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>So Blake, let's say there's a game, you've played it, you definitely want to own it. How much extra would you pay for the digital book, given that you have functional and moral reasons to prefer that format to the tree-corpse format?</blockquote>\nI am not Blake, but I know that Blake, as I, and as every other person who buy pdfs, are already paying the game author from 300% to 500% (it depends on the price and the cost of printings) of the amount he/she would get from a retail sale, and often double the amount he would get from a IPR direct sale. When I buy a printed book, I pay the printer, the distributor, the retailer, and the publisher. When I buy a pdf I don't pay the first three but pay double or more the publisher. In practice, we contract the sale directly without middlemen and share the savings.  If a game publisher would say to me "I don't want only to get all the saving you offer me, but I want even more from you, you will have to pay something extra to be able to save me a lot of expenses", my first answer would be "sorry, if this is a problem for you forget about the whole thing, I will buy it retail, I take back my $15 and I will give you the usual $2.45 instead". And probably I would think about how much I really need his game, too...<br/><br/>2) About marking the pdf with my name.<br/><br/>If I buy a pdf from you, you can be assured that I will share with some people. Not as in "file-sharing" in some network, but more as "Hi! I will GM this game next Saturday, take this pdf and study it, you will need to know the rules". Printing everything in enough copies for the entire group of players is a cost and a bother, and not always I have the chance to give a printed pdf to a player before the game.  <br/>I am rather sure that no one of my players will file-share the pdf (most of them don't have even the client installed), but I can't obviously be 100% sure, and I would not risk it, so this would mean that the pdf would lose a great deal of value from me.  Why I should buy a pdf without the advantage that pdf has over print?<br/><br/>Not only this: sometimes, I will give the pdf to a few friends who I think will like the game very much and are influential in their gaming communities.  And, sometimes, people give me pdfs of games that they think I will like. Without this, I would have brought exactly... ZERO indie games. I "discovered" indie games with a pdf of DitV that was "given" to me by someone who had brought it.  Without that "pirated" pdf, I would not have brought, at this time, something like $700 worth of indie games in two years (and in that amount it's included my own copy of the printed edition of DitV).  I would never have brought a game of "Mormon gunslingers" without that pdf. <br/>What did Vincent get from that act of "piracy"? Well, that copy was used to play with a lot of people, even at gaming conventions, that brought printed copies or pdfs (at the time I remember Vincent saying that the increase of orders from Italy was noticeable). One of these games was with the people who then brought the publishing rights of the italian translation, and so now DitV has a italian translation  and more money, again, for Vincent (and for all the other people who will be published by them).<br/><br/>Will this effect of "exponential exposure explosion of the game" be higher than the sales lost because of the pirating? I don't know, but I can assume that the effect isn't much different from the the famous donkey's dilemma: if you are thirsty, water is worth more than food. If you are hungry it's the reverse. And for the greater part of indie game publisher, exposure and the simple chance to "get the game in the hand of more players" is rarer, more difficult to get, worth more for him, and a publisher in this situation that remove this asset because he fear that the unwashed masses who never even hear of his game (and never will) will decide to search for a pirated copy of his game instead of searching for a copy of D&amp;D4, is (in my humble opinion, remember) simply shooting himself in the balls. Probably the publishers of D&amp;D are in a vastly different situation, but it's their business, and anyway why would someone who sell 250 copies/year have to follow the D&amp;D model of publishing?<br/><br/>So, no, it's not a matter of "trusting me" enough to avoid the cost and the hassle of making my copy. It's a matter of giving me the resource I need to HELP YOU SELL MORE. If you don't want me do do it, you only have to make it impossible for me. I will not show your game around, I will not play it with other people, and to be more sure than nobody, ever, will search for your game on e-mule, I probably will not even mention it's name anywhere.<br/><br/>3) The effect of marking copies.<br/><br/>It's really simple. Without marks, the pirated copy is the same of the one you buy, so if you choose to buy you don't get punished. With marks, the (demarked) pirated copy is better, and people who buy a marked copy get shafted with an inferior product.  Buy a inferior product or get a superior product for free? Mmmm....  what a difficult choice...<br/><br/>P.S.: if some game designer here has problem with the point (2) above and don't want me to use the pdf to promote the game, he doesn't have to mark it. It's enough that he say it here, and I will not promote his game. It's something I do for them, if they are against it, what would be the point?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158819/#Comment_158819" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-26T20:18:33+00:00" title="July 26, 2008  8:18PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's no need for you to answer my question, Moreno.

I' m truly sorry.<br/><br/>Nah, I get where you're going with this. I'm kind of arguing from a position of, "Well, people are selling PDFs already, what can be done to make it more comfortable for everyone to sell PDFs?" And there isn't a way to protect the content producers that isn't DRM, and while I'm not deeply opposed to DRM <i>if the fact that the content is DRM'd is built into the price</i> I can certainly understand why some people might be a little spooked (especially with Yahoo Music shuttering in a few months).<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not super comfortable with the idea of distributing PDFs to your players unless the content producers has built this into their use case (the sentiment of the discussion thus far seems to be the opposite, but I wanted to offer a counter voice). I think a fair, "middle-of-the-road" approach would be to sell "table licenses" of a PDF.. X for the core book, 3 dollars for each copy you intend to distribute. If you bought this on a web bookshelf, you'd type in the email addresses of the people to whom the book should be licensed and let the system tag and distribute them itself (such as bgates@microsoft.com, jesus@godhead.com, and a billion other fictitious emails, I know). I still think having traceability to a payment is better than nothing at all -- beating determined pirates isn't worth the effort, is what I tried to say previous.<br/><br/>To the point of whether or not to secretly tag PDFs with with the owner's information? I don't see why it couldn't be done publicly. Sorry, I hope the notion of making sure its "secretly" done hasn't clouded the discussion, that wasn't my intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

Something I would find intriguing, though it would obviously be a lot more work for the author, is to have literally personalized PDF rules.. Examples and explanations rewritten to best deal with a given person's experience and assumptions. This would require that the author have a good idea of who the recipient is, but I think it'd be a neat idea to try for "limited editions", such as "Special Offer! Personalized copy of ReCoil, just for you! Limit 10 EVER, so hurry and order yours today!" kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Probable practice as a someday game author: Combination of personalization techniques, made public. PDFs would be sold with a "this PDF the property of Blake Deakin" or an "I'd like to thank Blake Deakin for his support of this book" bit in the book.

Why don't points-buy games provide calculators and such? Anyone ever thought of making randomized charts (ex: Oracles) into just a "push to randomize" single page display instead of eight pages of tables? Why doesn't the PDF format have a landscape presentation, at the least (this doesn't even require Acrobat, just another book template to apply prior to PDFing for the digital version)?<br/><br/>I suppose it's that damned $300 price tag for Acrobat.

I would take offense that MY preferred format--printed book, which is usable in far more situations and locations than a PDF--is hamstrung or lacks the "full" content just because some producer has a misplaced sense of what it means to be "green." (I'd bet that over, say, a ten year lifecycle of owning and playing a game, that FAR more energy use and, thus, a far greater carbon footprint results from running a PC or laptop than from printing one copy of a book.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I, and as every other person who buy pdfs, are already paying the game author from 300% to 500% (it depends on the price and the cost of printings) of the amount he/she would get from a retail sale</blockquote>This repeated "fact" seems odd to me, because if I distributed a PDF of the full version of my game I would charge X, where X is the profit I expected to add on to the print costs of a normal book, to arrive at a final price. Put another way, every copy--digital or not--would earn me X no matter what format.<br/><br/>Do authors really "jack up" their per-copy price because PDFs are, basically, "free" to print and so they can get a higher margin without reaching a point where the price would impact demand? If so... well, damn, that's sort of lame. Any notion of "wanting me to be green" is tossed out the window, with the realization that my "responding" to the encouragement is also making a premium profit for the supposedly-green-encouraging producer. What an icky feeling (from one frequent consumer of POD and small-run game products).<br/><br/>Finally, about the watermarking/microdot/personalized title page--I think it's a tempest in a teapot, really. Sure, some Don Quixotes will get in a huff about having their copy uniquely tagged and go into nerd rage... but I'd suspect fully half of the average consumers to either say, "Meh" or say, "Cool!" (with the latter being equally split between, "cool, it's got my name in it" and "cool that this guy's doing something to thwart casual file sharing"). My stance--as this is a poll with no real research being linked--is definitely in the "Meh, whatever" camp. Of course, I don't buy PDFs--I abhor being strapped to a computer all day at work, WTF would I choose to do so when at play?--and the occasional free PDF I get here and there needs no such protection.<br/><br/>Final anecdote: my release scheme bypasses 90% of this whole issue:<br/>* Free PDF with core rules, for reference and for distribution to players. But no examples, nothing ready to run, no design notes or GM advice (my system is generic and highly customizable; think HERO LARP).<br/>* Full rules available as softcover printed book (priced so that retailers can get a "standard" ~40% margin without totally screwing myself on profit).<br/>* Full rules (no different than above) as a hardcover "Deluxe Edition" product, direct buy from me (via my POD provider's sales site). A bit pricier than the softcover, so as not to steal retailer sales too much (the hard back should cause that price markup automatically, but there's some numbers I still have to crunch). Oddly, the hardcover will probably net me the most profit, as I must "share" some of the gross profit on the softcover with retailers and yet I want to keep the hardcover higher priced than the softcover, to keep the retailers from being cut-out.<br/><br/>I am still considering offering a locked/personalized/no-can-print PDF with the Deluxe Edition. I probably won't, however, because I ALSO intend to have a database tool for game setup and character management, free online (with banner ads). As such, that tool will offer ten times the functionality of a mere PDF, leaving little value to the end user of a PDF version (basically, it would only be useful for offline reading).<br/><br/>That said... if folks want to hand-scan and stitch together a low-res (presumably) version of my full GLASS book, I reckon I'll just have a standard Cease &amp; Desist form to mail around, and hope the anecdotes of "piracy = more eventual sales" hold true for my little venture. In the end, supplements, custom work (ex: helping setup a game, for a fee), and (eventually, hopefully) licensing will make or break the GLASS product line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_159897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/159897/#Comment_159897" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-30T13:31:04+00:00" title="July 30, 2008  1:31PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>This repeated "fact" seems odd to me, because if I distributed a PDF of the full version of my game I would charge X, where X is the profit I expected to add on to the print costs of a normal book, to arrive at a final price.

Distribution and retail would cut into the profit margin of print books, right?  But would it cut them so much as to make a .pdf sale worth 3 or 5 times as much as a print sale?  I have no idea!

I understand that printers are people, too, and need to eat (and the children of retailers and distributors need to get some present sometimes), but when I play a rpg and I am happy and want to give money to the author for creating this game, and I have to choose between choice (1) give him/her directly $9.99 for the pdf  or (2) (it's an example, I am making up these numbers) giving $9.00 to the retailer, $3.00 to IPR, $2.00 to the post office, $3.00 to the printer, and only $3 to the author, paying a total of $20.00, I have little doubt about what to choose.<br/><br/>I already said this, but it didn't take, to I repeat: I see it a little as if me and the game author are contracting directly without other people in the middle. I pay less, he/she gets more, we are both happy. If I would be so crass to pretend that he didn't get anything more from having made me pay less, it would be like... I don't know, like if he wanted the same price for the pdf and the printed copy. In both cases someone want some advantage without giving nothing to the other. Or like if he watermarked, in secret, the pdf (a basic betrayal of trust. Not his trust in me. My trust in him)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160048/#Comment_160048" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-31T08:42:42+00:00" title="July 31, 2008  8:42AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>OH MY GOD IT'S CAPITALISM!</blockquote>Yep, and I'd prefer not to support that heinous economic model. Sue me.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I already said this, but it didn't take, to I repeat: I see it a little as if me and the game author are contracting directly without other people in the middle.

Sure, folks can buy direct from my Lulu link, for full MSRP X, netting me the full profit Y. But if they support their FLGS, I "share" that profit with the store--who is also buying direct from Lulu, but at a retailer discount to give them their profit margin. I may require a bulk purchase to get that--prolly "buy three or more at price Z"--but in the end, I'll share profits to gain that exposure. SO if I offered a PDF--which I prolly won't, as I wrote above--it would be for Y (full profit, no more), direct download from me/Lulu.<br/><br/>Shipping is sort of off my pricing radar, as it can vary wildly. Folks buying games at Lulu know the MSRP doesn't include the shipping... all the MORE reason to get their FLGS to carry it (and enjoy bulk shipping rates, cutting minimally into their margin).<br/><br/>Anyhow... didn't mean to accuse anyone of being capitalist pigs. If you have this tight relationship with your customers and they like paying you double or triple profit (say) for the same content/creative effort, then you're luckier folks than I. And I don't see the FLGS's profit as a "skim" off my own, but rather as a partnership which should reap me greater exposure long-term.<br/><br/>And, yep, I'm as commie as they come. Fear the love, man! Fear the love!
