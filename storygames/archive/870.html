<p><strong><em>Invisible Shepherds</em></strong> is my scifi game about an elite team of above the law operatives dealing with issues in their personal lives while trying to save the world.</p>
<p>I promised some people a playtest document this week.  Something where they could see all the rules that were floating around in my head so they wouldn't feel the need to guess at it anymore.  Well, it's not as polished as I'd like, but this is as far as I'm probably going to get in the next couple of weeks.  With Origins next week I'm going to have to redirect my energy to getting my shit together for that.</p>
<p>You can find what I've got together so far over at my site <a href="http://www.ericsrpgs.com/" rel="nofollow">Eric's RPGs</a>.  It's rough and there are some specific things I was hoping to get done before bringing it to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Authoring the resources for all the character types needs work.  Specifically, how many skill points everyone gets.  </li>
<li>Toys.  The goal is to have maybe half a dozen iconc items for each of the lists.  Most of it is kinda half-assed, and there isn't anything at all for Cyber yet.  Cyber is gonna be extra important.  I didn't want to throw down just anything there.  </li>
<li>Teeth.  The lists are looking pretty good, but definately need a bit more polishing before I sit down for the first playtest.  </li>
</ul>
<p>My goal right now is to get enough done so that I can get in at least one or maybe two playtest sessions after Origins but before GenCon.</p>
<p>I think it's a real good design and I'm excited about getting a chance to share it.  If you take the chance to read it I'll be real happy to hear any questions, concerns, or comments you have.  Tear it down if you like, I'll enjoy hearing about any reaction you have to it.</p>
