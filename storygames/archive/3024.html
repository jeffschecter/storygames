We cobbled together a group of stragglers from Jeff's Carry game to form the Ganakagok superteam of Patty, Joshua, Jeffery and Dave.  Josh and Jeff had played in Mel's game earlier and as I read Mel's Actual Play I see some interesting similarities.<br/><br/>The theme of the game was tradition.  The players tied their fates together nicely.  Patty's and Joshua's PCs were lovers.  Dave's PC was to be Patty's arranged husband.  Joshua's PC was to be married off to Patty's older sister.  Jeffery played Joshua's father. The group worked off one another scene to scene and often used elements from previous scenes to add to their own.  the most notable was that we decided that there was a notch-toothed whale that "haunted" the eastern region of our map.  It constantly came up and eventually it turned out to BE the ancestors of the Nitu showing it's disapproval throughout the narrative.  <br/><br/>We tried using a larger standing pad for the relationship map and the island map.  We used post-its for the names and drew lines between them.  I liked the larger maps although it meant that the players couldn't pick them up and look at them.  I have to play more to see what impact this has.  I adore the mapping system built into Ganakagok.  When we were mapping out lores, loves and fears we saw the maps develop and really gave life to the story.  Kudos Bill for incorporating such an evocative part of the process.<br/><br/>The game moved along smoothly.  The players built in internal conflict so they were often acting against one another far more than with one another.  There was one instance where a player had a 1 the sta they were working with so there was nothing in the action portion of the dice grid.  You really have to pick you're battles wisely.  I dig this.  It actually shows that a certain level of gaminess and a learning curve is part of Ganakagok thus the more you play it the more likely you'll have favorable outcomes (assuming that is your goal - I think the Good/Bad Medicine system definately feeds into tradegy elements of the game - but that's another post).<br/><br/>Now I try to steer my game in a wuxia direction, eally playing up the fanastic elements of the setting.  However, I was surprised (pleasantly so) how strong the cards drive a very grounded, tribal motif.  We had a few HK Action moments but the game still focused on survival and walrus blubber and tribal edicts.  I really need to drive home the wuxia elements if I really want that to work.  I think the simple (albeit work intensive) answer is to create a new deck.  Since the themes and narrative revolve around the deck so thoroughly I was surprised to see how clsoe to home the players stayed.  I think they would have stepped out on the more fantastic if they had card prompts that were more evocative of those elements.  I would think that some (including myself) would almost disregard the deck as color and numbers and not really recognize it's impact on the game.  Well done.<br/><br/>There was a little drift in the rules.  <br/>First off the session was a little short (3ish hours) and many of my players expected to enter into another game around 9:30pm.  So we only played a night game and did the wrapup.  Having played the game once (and read through it twice) I knew the weight of the Nitu and Ganakagok story points but didn't emphasize them.  The bad medicine was pretty overwhelming so I focused my advice on either distributing good medicine to improve the PC's personal outcome (good medicine) or that of the tribe and island.<br/><br/>Secondly, and sadly, there was little in the way of cannibal ghouls.  This was a horrible oversight on my part.  In retrospect there was a minor element to that.  In the final narraration the younger nitu left with the exiled lovers to start their own tribe while the elders went back to the village, the nitu eventually dying off.  Josh mentioned that they no doubt would have to turn to cannibalism to survive!  It was just a shame that they couldn't have shown up sooner.<br/><br/>Let me know if there is anything else you'd like me to include.  Pictures of the maps and insertions of the character names will follow tomorrow.  I'd love to hear from my players to get their perspectives on many of these topics.  Particularly good and bad moments and how the rules and the rest of the group succeeded or failed (it's okay, I have a pretty thick skin)<br/><br/> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68899/#Comment_68899" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T09:03:31+00:00" title="May 14, 2007  9:03AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in this game as Tinkagoq, the Quick (to) Judge, who had the arranged betrothal to Patty's character. I had a blast. Here's some thoughts in no particular order.<br/><br/>Don, to his credit, did a very thorough job making sure we knew what we were doing during character generation. I started getting nervous that we were going to run out of time to play and might have rushed him here and there. This might have been the time to incorporate more Wuxia, either (as you suggest) by a variant deck, or just by really encouraging players that direction during character generation. If you'd been more explicit about that tone, I think we would have all gone for it. For example, I added my ice-spear and named it because of your discussion of the wuxia elements the night before during Agon. A little more direction there would have spurred more of that. <br/><br/>Since we had relatively little time once play started, it seemed like the Future-Vision, Change-Hope, and Change-Fear of the various characters didn't enter into the story much, but going through those as an exercise was helpful for me to figure out who Tinkagoq was and what he was all about. But if you're going to do this over many cons, I'd suggest speeding that part up.<br/><br/>I thought the large relationship maps worked well, and the fact that we had post-its to put on our nametags also helped. <br/><br/>Knowing in advance how deeply the scales were tipped towards bad medicine, I had resigned myself to an icy tragedy, and barely even worked towards anything resembling a happy ending. This was fine for me, but it seems like you would have wanted me (us) to be working harder towards good medecine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68938/#Comment_68938" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T10:27:55+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 10:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2007 10:28AM by eruditus.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not harder toward good medicine, necessarily.  I just didn't introduce the option to compete for narrative control.  I think it's an awesome mechanic but this time I decided to see how far the group would "go with the flow" and run the bad medicine gambit or if you would all struggle to save the tribe.  Again, for a first game (in a 3 hour session) that was all a little much to swallow.  As mentioned I would assume this adds to the flexability Ganakagok offers where someone might think everything it too entrenched.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68940/#Comment_68940" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T10:28:22+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 10:28AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don -- Short of creating a new deck (which I don't think is a bad idea), don't underestimate the power of your initial setting description to shape players' perceptions of what is possible in creating their characters' back stories. You could include reference to flying ice-warriors with blades of clear obsidian, polar bear-riding hunters battling white mammoths, and so forth. If you already did this, then I'm mistaken, but I've noticed that players do respond to variations in the phrasing of that initial pitch, so a big variation should produce a big response. -- Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68944/#Comment_68944" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-14T10:32:17+00:00" title="May 14, 2007 10:32AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah, as Dave mentioned I may have brought across those themes better to him earlier than at the game.  I did go into much of it but I suppose I fell short.  Additionally I think that Mel's game may have colored mine.  Half the players played a sessions worth of a more grounded game the day before and I think that may have cemented some of the interpretations as well.
