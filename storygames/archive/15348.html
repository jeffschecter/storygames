It's a reminder that these RPGs are social activities, with all the challenges such activities entail. <br/>I've been following the Flames of Gold podcasts, although I missed the last couple--this certainly has drawn me back.  My two cents up front--the Circles rules certainly do allow 'Circling' named NPCs. However, strictly reading the rules, such a named NPC must have been 'a contact named in a previous Circles test,' (BWG 382).  So, since the concerned NPC, Boarstooth, was introduced to the story earlier through GM scene setting, there is a grey area about using Circles as indicated in the podcast.  It's the GM's call on interpreting grey areas, and the game goes on.  <br/>I would have made the opposite interpretation. Keeping in mind that Luke quotes Vincent Baker's admonition, 'roll dice or say yes'; Burning Wheel has among its core principles the goals of reducing GM fiat and empowering characters.  And the Circles rules are an appropriate mechanism for finding a known NPC.  Circles are not, however, a mechanism for 'running into' an NPC who just happens to be near a warehouse hideout the PCs are investigating. PCs use Circles to find NPCs; not to add them to ongoing scenes.  So, in the game, I like to think I would not have said, 'Boarstooth is not in the city, tough.'  I like to think I would have said, 'Maybe he's here.  You last saw him weeks ago in a distant city, surrounded by his women and counting his gold.  He told you he wasn't going anywhere until his gold ran out and he says he's not scared of anything--so nothing will frighten him from his home. But, anything is possible. How do you find him?'  This means that the PC who wanted to find Boarstooth can either continue what he was doing (which I think was tailing another PC), or embark on seeing if Boarstooth is in town (giving up the shadowing).  And, I'd (potentially) take advantage of the Circles Obstacles to reflect the intrinsic unlikelihood that Boarstooth is present: Obstacle 1 (base) + 3 (specific occupation: Boarstooth) +3 (specific disposition; Boarstooth) + 3 (Here and Now) = 10.  If the PCs meet that obstacle, then the PCs find Boarshead--maybe I'd even agree that Boarshead was near the warehouse 'here and now' as originally desired.  But if the Circles roll fails, a whole slew of possibilities emerge.  Maybe Boarshead is in the warehouse but is a captive.  Maybe the hunt for Boarshead takes all night--he's eventually found, but what else has gone on while the PC was looking?  Maybe the PCs learn that Boarshead is in trouble back in his home.  At the very least, the failed Circles roll could become a vehicle for me to inform the PCs of what's going on with Boarshead, if I want to foreshadow a conflict or introduce some other element.  The fun part for me as a GM is the unexpected, so having Boarshead show up unexpectedly would definitely make things fun!<br/>This is all water under the bridge.  I'm pointing out different ways of handling this situation for use in figuring out how your group, or others, will handle similar situations in the future.    Continuing play without a consensus on this point of contention will either continue to fester as long as you play BW, or it will lead the players to ignore Circles due to lingering doubts of the mechanics. Maybe!<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348715/#Comment_348715" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-11T13:56:20+00:00" title="November 11, 2011  1:56PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This episode was one of my favorite RPG podcast episodes of the year.

As I see it, the PCs took the fastest ship available get to this pirate city, and the port was blockaded minutes after they arrived. When they left their home city they decided to take some people and things with them and leave other people and things behind. Who is or isn't with them is important to the fictional situation -- if they want to get back to the people or things in their home city they should have their characters do stuff to get there, not bypass the situation by rolling Circles. If Boarstooth was locked in a dungeon you'd have to do something like break in and get him, not just Circle him up, right? Being on the wrong side of a naval blockade shouldn't be any different. The Admiral's wife would be a great hostage to use as leverage in resolving the blockade, should the players be allowed to Circle her up, even though she ought to be back at her house in the home city?<br/><br/>My take on the problem is that there's an assumption that some players are making which is that Burning Wheel is a game where the players have a lot of narrative authority to do things like add facts to the world during play. I think that assumption is wrong. In general, I think the players are supposed to change the fictional situation by having their characters act in the fiction, not by direct player authorship over the world. Burning Wheel isn't completely black and white on this point, since you can <i>sort of</i> use Circles and Wises to do this, but my impression is that those mechanics are for when you want to crystallize something that hasn't been previously considered, not for altering the world in a way to give your character an advantage. There are some games that do a lot of that, but I don't think BW is one of them. From listening to previous episodes where Jeff frequently tries to use Wises to do similar things I get the impression that he's the one who's most invested in the idea of player authorship over the world during play (rather than during world burning) so it's not surprising that he was involved in the conflict. I can also see where Bill's frustration with Jeff has been growing for a while. I don't think Jeff is being malicious, but I think his excitement and need to fill silences leads him to jump in and say how he would handle things during pauses that occur when Bill is trying to be thoughtful and considered in his responses. Even if Jeff doesn't mean it this way, it often gives the impression that he's fighting to be the GM.<br/><br/>I think another contributing factor to the situation is that some of the characters don't have good goals cooked into their Beliefs. Talufel, for example, doesn't seem to actually want anything. I got the impression that the idea to Circle up Boarstooth came because the player was casting around for something to do rather than because he was deeply invested in the idea. I think you guys are still a little too hung up on thinking in a D&amp;D-style "what does the party want to do?" way rather than looking at what the characters want as individuals. I think you'd all have an easier time playing if you were less tolerant of the weaker, passive Beliefs and tried to workshop some more active and goal-oriented Beliefs for the characters. If they had their own agendas to push they wouldn't have to spend so much time and energy finding excuses to go along for the ride with other characters. (Also I was kind of surprised that Jeff thought his belief wasn't being challenged -- my take was that Bill was challenging the "by any means necessary" part of the belief about protecting Madrauder: from listening it certainly seems to me that the dwarf isn't willing to make a deal that Madrauder objects to, or smuggle Madrauder out without his ship, even though those are things that could potentially protect Madrauder).<br/><br/>Thanks again for putting out the episode, and for being cool enough to let other people offer their opinions and perspectives. Saying things about other people's play that might sound critical is usually a little bit taboo, so I'm glad you guys are secure and open enough to invite people to talk about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell" title="Russell"><img alt="Russell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell">Russell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348745/#Comment_348745" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-12T01:10:58+00:00" title="November 12, 2011  1:10AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 12, 2011 1:11AM by Russell.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm three minutes into this and I'm already outraged.

After all, no matter how good the a game is, I wouldn't keep coming back week after week if I was surrounded by a bunch of a-holes. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Good Gaming!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349256/#Comment_349256" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T07:48:06+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  7:48AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>Add me to the list of people who appreciate you keeping this in the episode.<br/><br/>I'm not an expert on the system, but I agreed with Bill's original call: Boarstooth can't be Circled up, that's not what the Circles mechanic is for. </blockquote>\nI was on definitely on the side of the player on this one, but I also didn't realize there was a naval blockade. That changes things a bit for me. Trapped behind a naval blockade would be a legitimate reason to say no to a Circles roll in my book.<br/><br/>But it sounded like their issues had been brewing for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
