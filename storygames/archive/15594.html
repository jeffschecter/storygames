I trust you're happy with the amount we've deposited into your account and your health insurance should be cleared in the next 4 weeks. Let's get started!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Goals:</b><br/>\n<br/>\n- Double revenue to $50 million yearly with a healthy growth trajectory!<br/>\n- Make D&amp;D; a brand. It's not about editions or rules. Anyone who has ever played D&amp;D; is part of one big family!<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: increasing DDI subscribers from 50,000 to 250,000 accomplishes this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Guidelines - Make Something that:</b><br/>\n<br/>\n- Pleases 1E players who love simulation, drawing maps and polearms, 2E players who love story &amp; setting, 3E players who love ultimate choice and Pathfinder, and 4E players who love tactics and miniatures.<br/>\n- 1E players can play with their kids.<br/>\n- Takes advantage of the fact that we now have the video game rights to D&amp;D.;<br/>\n- Potentially attracts readers of those lovely Legend of Drizzt novels.<br/>\n- Isn't an edition. Research shows editions now have negative connotations. Don't forget that D&amp;D;'s 40th anniversary is in 2 years!<br/>\n- Isn't restricted by the World of Warcraft MMO subscription paradigm. Research shows Free to Play, Facebook games, and mobile are hot, hot, hot! Although Magic the Gathering business is up! We LOVE our Magic dollars!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Budget:</b><br/>\n<br/>\n- 1 million dollars, not including your salary for 1 year.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Deadline:</b><br/>\n<br/>\n- 12 months.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Rewards:</b><br/>\n<br/>\n- 2nd year of employment! Although in our contract we promise not to lay you off during the holidays.<br/>\n- A 10% raise and an additional week of vacation!<br/>\n- We'll invest more money in D&amp;D;! Think "D&amp;D; Cartoon" on our HUB TV network! Look at our success with My Little Pony and now imagine that for D&amp;D;!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Any questions?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWe'll have a kickoff meeting tomorrow. Corporate is so very excited to see your monetization, forward thinking, ROI focused, share holder driven strategy!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tork" title="tork"><img alt="tork" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tork">tork</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353532/#Comment_353532" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T06:31:28+00:00" title="January  9, 2012  6:31AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find your forward-thinking and ambitious vision inspiring.

Maybe it's naive, but I have faith that consistent and fun play isn't too high of a standard to demand of a game, especially the biggest game in roleplaying.  To compare to another fighty game, I'd just like something slightly more consistent than Agon, which doesn't seem like too much to ask.<br><br>I don't think 4E failed because its design perspective was too focused; I think it failed because it wasn't consistently fun to play.  I picked up the core books, got excited about it, and tried to play more-or-less by the guidelines in the books, and by the third session we were already ready to switch back to something else. I think the history of indie games shows that when you ask people to do something that's actually more fun or a different kind of fun that's on par with what they're already doing, they don't need that much convincing. There just wasn't much there that arose to meet our enthusiasm and the work we put into it, and --from what I heard -- the dedicated players who played a bunch of 4E had to put in a ton more work just to make it fun at the table.<br><br>On the extendability issue: how many hacks, custom moves, and mini-supplements exist for AW now? It's not easy to nail that every time, but it's not rocket surgery. They just have to nail it once every 5+ years.  I definitely don't envy the pressure that Mike and the others feel, especially when there's a bunch of folks like me that complain that they're doing it wrong, but come on.  Maybe it's the company-mandated design process and design-by-committee and all the other crap that entails that's getting in the way -- I suspect that plays a major part in it -- as well as the crazy guidelines and goals (like John posted above: it has to work as a Facebook ap?), but making D&amp;D consistently fun shouldn't be as hard as it's been the past few years.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353551/#Comment_353551" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T08:47:00+00:00" title="January  9, 2012  8:47AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Realise lots of people simply don't have the time for all the work as a DM and spend all the budget on good adventure and campaign module writers (plus obviously nice looking maps). Each adventure and module should come in several versions for different editions. While it's possible to buy the digitally and massive piracy will happen the printed products should be very useful with maps you can use by the table (and lamination so you can draw and erase stuff from them) so people buy them anyway. The adventures should be bold and imaginitive and not released without extensive playtesting. The playtest notes should come in the box so DMs running it has a heads up on what works and what doesn't. Seriously, the adventures must be bold and not cowardly shit. Clear explanation of what to expect as a DM too: is this an adventure where you fight a bunch of connected encounters? Is this a fish tank? How to adjust for different playstyles or skill levels or character levels?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353553/#Comment_353553" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T09:18:39+00:00" title="January  9, 2012  9:18AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2012 10:34AM by jenskot.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>30 ways I would improve D&amp;D;:</b><br/>\n<i>(based on Wizards of the Coast's goals, not my own personal preferences)</i><br/>\n<br/>\n1. Bring back the OGL.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Sell PDFs and Print of Demand versions of every single thing ever released with the D&amp;D; name on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Convert all this content into OGL.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. But require that to use the OGL, you must be a D&amp;D; subscriber!<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Since Pathfinder is already OGL, flip the tables and reintegrate Pathfinder back into D&amp;D.; Make Pathfinder part of D&amp;D; rather than competition. Do the same for Mutants &amp; Masterminds.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Hire market research and usability testing experts to work with our designers. Asking existing fans about products meant for new fans is biased. Same with asking existing fans about what appeals to old fans. Implement strict procedures for recording unbiased playtesting data, reviewing input against our goals, rolling out changes, testing the results, revise, repeat. Get ego, personal agendas, non-rational/emotional decisions out of the process!<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Fans can make their own version of D&amp;D;! Pick and choose the options you want from any edition. Upload your own cover. Create your own credits page. Write your own intro. Choose from a wide array of binding and paper options. We will mail you your own personal unique copy of D&amp;D.;<br/>\n<br/>\n8. We will give you the option to sell your own version of D&amp;D; through our website and we will split the profits with you. Now all your players can buy a copy.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Stop developing software. License software. Reach out to the D&amp;D; fans working for Google. Use Google Plus and Google Docs as our virtual Table Top. Use Google's Schemer to find players based on availability and playstyle. Don't create out own social network tools.Use Facebook and Twitter. Use what people use. Don't create costly proprietary tools that people are unfamiliar with.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Open up the D&amp;D; Online Database to 3rd party content. Create tools that let fans rate this content so that the stars rise and the crap sinks. Include a DM warning option to label content that may be good but game breaking. Tag content based on edition and play style.<br/>\n<br/>\n11. Forget editions. Instead the next version of D&amp;D; will be a toolkit anniversary edition celebrating all of D&amp;D; over the last 40 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n12. Instead of editions, we will have a stripped down version of D&amp;D; that fits on 20 pages or less than you can make characters and play in 15 minutes. All the different edition advanced content will be available as modules.<br/>\n<br/>\n13. Instead of organizing modules by editions, organize it by playstyle. Want D&amp;D; to be more tactical? Use these modules. More story based, use these modules. More immersive? Something in-between? Mix and match and let us know what works best for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n14. No more editions. Now there are just optional updates.<br/>\n<br/>\n15. Create a section on Deviant Art just for D&amp;D; Fan Art. Users can vote on their favorites to be included in future products.<br/>\n<br/>\n16. Forget teaching games via rule books. Have them but don't rely on them. Most people learn by word of mouth. Embrace it. Teach people how to play via YouTube videos. Via audiobooks. Via classes at gaming stores. Teach people who to teach others!<br/>\n<br/>\n17. Create easy to learn family friendly D&amp;D; boardgames that can scale into full blown RPGs with the right modules.<br/>\n<br/>\n18. Convince Hasbro that profits from D&amp;D; video game licensing should be included as part of our overall sales.<br/>\n<br/>\n19. Make a lot of this content free to use for as long as you are a D&amp;D; subscriber. Experiment with Free to Play + micro-transactions. Experiment!<br/>\n<br/>\n20. Now that we have the D&amp;D; video game rights back, make it a requirement that all D&amp;D; video games give you the option to import / export your characters for play in the tabletop versions.<br/>\n<br/>\n21. Keep supporting local gaming stores with D&amp;D; Encounters. Create training seminars for the stores and DMs.<br/>\n<br/>\n22. Encourage local gaming stores and gaming communities to run more frequent 1 or 2 day mini conventions. Teach them how. Find space they can rent. As retail stores close down, conventions keep growing in popularity. People are social. Encourage this. Give people places to go, to meet, to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n23. Get the Hunger Games &amp; Harry Potter licenses. But don't just create a Harry Potter RPG. Create a game where Harry Potter is an adventurer in the D&amp;D; world. I know this is easier said than done.<br/>\n<br/>\n24. Create custom versions of D&amp;D; presented by Vin Diesel, Wil Wheaton, and Felicia Day. If Felicia Day is in charge, what would her D&amp;D; look like? What would D&amp;D; look like if it was written by an 11 year old in China?<br/>\n<br/>\n25. Bring back Choose your own Adventure books but in App form. Let people use these Apps to build their own fully formed characters to play in the D&amp;D; RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\n26. Create mobile games where you can play your D&amp;D; character solo in-between games. Earn the chance to gain extra treasure at the cost of starting the next game with more damage or other costs. When you are done playing, the game emails your DM the results of you side adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\n27. Create apps you can play D&amp;D; solo when you don't have a group to play with. As they go up in level, tell them about people in their area they can play with. "Congratulations, you just unlocked level 5 and acquired a vorpal +2 sword. We noticed in your profile that you prefer tactical play. There are currently 3 gaming groups within 20 miles of your location who are also level 5 and like tactics who have an open spot in their games. Would you like us to introduce you?"<br/>\n<br/>\n28. Make sure all these variations all still feedback into the bare minimum basic D&amp;D; rules at their core. Expand the family tree that is D&amp;D; while keep the roots strong and something we keep coming back to as leave grow, die, and grow again.<br/>\n<br/>\n29. Test all of these ideas ruthlessly.

It feels super appropriate. There was a lot of talk in the announcement about uniting existing D&amp;D players spread over however many iterations of the game there are out there.

What they need to do is unite D&amp;D <i>tables</i>. That is, if the way 5E works is "bunch-of-modules-that-you-pick-and-choose", what matters is that everyone at a given table has agreed to use the same modules, prior to play. Guess what?

My understanding is that Wizards is treated differently in general but possibly not on this specific point.

Historically they've tried this to some extent with Chainmail. For reasons I don't have access to, whenever they have tried to sell D&amp;D related games under the D&amp;D umbrella but with different rules, it didn't work. During 3E, Chainmail was a way to sell minis but very few people wanted to buy a different yet related game (even though they added parts to connect it more directly to the main game). So in 4E they abandoned a separate miniature game and built minis right into 4E. That said, just because a similar strategy didn't work in the past, doesn't mean it can't work in the future. Apple released a tablet that failed many years ago but now the IPad is intensely successful. A lot comes down to the small details and how the bigger picture is presented and framed.

Instead let everyone know you will put them back up 3 months after the new edition is launched to get them to focus on 5e first.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353646/#Comment_353646" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T16:31:44+00:00" title="January  9, 2012  4:31PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When can I join the design team, not the marketing team?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353650/#Comment_353650" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T17:01:28+00:00" title="January  9, 2012  5:01PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2012 9:31PM by TylerT.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You will give me the Reigns of DnD freely!

Then you could add an "AD&amp;D Pack" with exceptional strength, and THAC0, and d100 save-against-death, and GM fiat as the source of NWP bonuses, and a short list of NWPs themselves, and... Or a "3e Pack" with a long skill and feat list, combat and saves as really just another skill, and rudimentary minis rules, and ELs, and...

I've visited the Paizo forums and people seem familiar with the adventure paths to what I consider a surprising degree. They seem to help sell the Pathfinder world, Golarion, too, and get people excited about the setting, which is a nice coup. They seem to be onto something there. Now they're starting that Pathfinder MMO and again look to be using D&amp;D as both inspiration and cautionary example at once. <br><br>The goals for 5e, to me, are completely ridiculous and impossible. I can't really see D&amp;D succeeding like WotC want it to, though it should be an interesting train wreck to behold. If they went the Marvel route and used D&amp;D as an IP farm, they might be on to something, but that's going to be tough. Marvel's using its not-so successful comics business and the stories it generates as a garden for its much more lucrative movie and TV shows. It seems to have saved their ass for the moment. Not sure D&amp;D, the game, can do the same thing, but maybe it's their best bet. <br><br>Really, it seems obvious to me that they just need to realise which way the wind is blowing and scale back expectations. Maybe WotC should just sell D&amp;D off entirely to a smaller publisher that could give it a better home. D&amp;D is certainly a big fish, but I don't think the pond is as big as they think it is.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353679/#Comment_353679" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T21:08:20+00:00" title="January  9, 2012  9:08PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope I'm proven wrong!

Instead, turn the license into the best Facebook/web/social-media game ever. Create a whole lot of 2D art and map content with text-based stories. Create some very clever procedural dungeon generator code for infinite dungeons. Cater different quest lines to people who want hack and slash, exploration, story, or PVP. Offer super-simple path options with almost no choices for players but also let people step outside those boxes and customize their characters to the Nth degree. Facilitate solo play, solo play with NPCs, group play with other PCs, guilds and other self-organizing modes, and the like.<br><br>Make sure your story rocks. It has to be better than World of Warcraft. Hire Ed Greenwood and the like to write a story with teeth. Since it's just text and scripting, and not 3D animated graphics with voice-overs, you can do a lot more of this than WoW can. A million bucks goes a lot further.<br><br>Do not charge for content, even in the DDO model where you get a bunch of content for free but pay for special content. Charge for advertisement. Sure, charge for perks like NPCs casting spells on you. Use smart portions of the terrible, awful Zynga model without overly annoying your players. <br><br>Create a peer-voted system of DMs who can create content through a web interface, using formulaic risk:reward ratios. Let people vote content up or down. Players just won't play in dungeons that get crappy ratings. Make the multiverse something gonzo and all-inclusive like Planescape. Anything goes, but it has to go in the "right place."

The obvious candidate for that economy is xp or something similar, but unlike a lot of other games xp isn't traditionally something that is spent on critical stuff in D&amp;D. Some D&amp;D variations use "action points", where a small amount of a resource can be spent for useful but fleeting advantage. Maybe that could be made into a core unifying economy somehow, where each module provides ways of earning and spending action points doing things central to the schtick of that module and, importantly, the points are fungible between the modules. So, if you play with the "Advanced Combat Module" and the "High Politics" module, a point earned for a some great combat thing can be used to fuel some roughly equivalently great political thing.<br/><br/>Dunno.

I mean, it's <i>work</i>, but it's not <i>hard</i>.<br/><br/>Get the basics down: six abilities, three classes (four if navigation/orientation/movement has to be a basic thing), experience levels, fighting.<br/><br/>Everything else is modular options. For each part of the game, there are several canonical options that all the published products will make reference to, and then you can also write your own for when you assemble your own version of the game as per John's suggestions <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a>.<br/><br/>For abilities, you have a number of basic options, like:<br/><br/>Ab 1: Desperate scoundrels. Roll 3d6 in order.<br/><br/>Ab 2: Heroic heroes. Some version of 4d6 drop the lowest and arrange where you want.<br/><br/>Ab 3: Tournament (or whatever). Point-buy system. You need a point-buy system version for Living games and tournaments and whatnot.<br/><br/>For skills, you have options like:<br/><br/>Sk 1: No skills. Freeform it, whatever, consult your DM.<br/><br/>Sk 2: Proficiencies. Either you have a skill or you don't. Roll your ability or less on a d20 to employ a skill successfully.<br/><br/>Sk 3: Detailed skill system. Just like 3rd + 4th editions, with extended skill challenges and variable DCs and blah blah blah. You can still make desperate weaklings with lower point totals, and mighty demigods with higher point totals.<br/><br/>Etc. for everything else in the game. The miniatures battles stuff is canonical for tournaments and whatnot, but is also an optional book. Feats and 4E-style powers are optional modules. So you start with OD&amp;D or B/X, essentially, and add things until you get the edition you want. Some things will have to be tweaked throughout the rules to get everything nicely compatible (saving throws, xp/level numbers, etc) but fuck the complainers, as long as each thing is only as complicated as it absolutely has to be. Grognards can stick with their OD&amp;D and their B/X, but newer players who prefer that style will just play the basic D&amp;D rules with no modules. "We're hardcore, we play D&amp;D with <i>no optional modules</i>, man!"<br/><br/>When you go to play you will simply have to say which modules you are playing with. I know, that is complicated because y'alls are lazy-ass mutha fuckahs, but we will cater to you! That is what the official settings are for. Cramming Dragondudes and eladrin into every single setting is a dumb idea, and so is trying to make desperate greedy scoundrel dungeonfucks play the same as noble heroes defending the many points of light.<br/><br/>So when you buy the Ravenloft setting, it says:<br/>Ab 1, roll 3d6 in order.<br/>Sk 2, this setting has proficiencies.<br/>No feats, no psionics, no primal magic. Arcane, divine, and martial classes only.<br/>Humans dominate, dwarves, elves, and halflings allowed.<br/><br/>And when you buy Dark Sun, it says:<br/>Ab 2, way better stats.<br/>Sk 3, this setting uses the advanced skill system, and uses it for dangerous wilderness exploration especially.<br/>All gonzo powers are in.<br/>The list of races from the original Dark Sun stands, no others.<br/><br/>And if you want to play Dark Sun without feats and skills, you just say so. If you want to play Ravenloft with skill challenges, you say "we're playing Ravenloft with the advanced skills module."<br/><br/>Conceptually easy. Lots of work to implement. Not actually hard, in terms of whether it can be done or not.<br/><br/>And frankly, I don't see <i>any other way</i> to even remotely reconcile the various editions. They are not the same game and will never be the same game and people play different editions because they want to play different games. By making the skeleton compatible with the various slottable modules, you at least have a common language and understanding between everybody. It's already several games, and trying to make it one game isn't going to work, so the only feasible alternative is to make D&amp;D into a <i>range</i> of gaming. Not one game, not several games, but many interchangeable shades of gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353805/#Comment_353805" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T17:03:38+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  5:03PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

I liken it to indie music.  This college band comes out from Athens, GA making these kinda weird songs that appeal to this indie crowd.  People are drawn to it in and of itself, but also because they want to be part of the "different".  So, this band has you know only a few thousand followers or something.  Then the band signs on to a big label and they start making different music.  Not different bad, but just different.  More mainstream, understandable, danceable even.  Now you got this small set of people who feel disenfranchised cause their band "sold out", but this huge new segment of people who love to dance to their music.  R.E.M. of old is just not the same band as they were later on.  THat's cool, it's evolution.<br/><br/>THing is, D&amp;D needs to play some new music.  Screw first edition nostalgia...cause everybody that's going to play that already has it or one of the almost exact retroclones.  No need to put that stuff out again.  Sing a new song.  It's hard and scary to innovate, but you can't look back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353839/#Comment_353839" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T21:17:18+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  9:17PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2012 9:20PM by johnzo.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Here's how you double your revenue:<br/><br/>Do not create a TRPG.

The reason I visit this community above all other roleplaying communities is because the folks here tend to enjoy the games I tend to enjoy; why then do we have such different visions for the flagship roleplaying game? Perhaps one of D&amp;D's distinguishing features is that it means many different things to many different people.<br/><br/>Personally, I disagree with the push for modular design which is strong here and over at ENWorld (and probably elsewhere too). Someone on ENWorld said it well; to paraphrase him: 'I liked the idea of three customisable base classes [Warrior, Expert, Adept] until I saw it done'. I spent hours creating various generic, points-buy or feat-based takes on the SRD, only to settle on strong, zany classes.<br/><br/>For example, I really like that paladins get mounts and rangers cast spells and that clerics wear heavy armour. Unarmoured priests and non-magical hunters turn up all the time in fantasy fiction and history, but I don't think that's an argument for having them as core classes. Those illogical bumps ('Aragorn could cast spells? Unarmoured priests never go dungeoncrawling but unarmoured wizards do all the time? Everyone of Lawful alignment can speak Lawful?') I think help make D&amp;D D&amp;D and not a high fantasy emulator. <br/><br/>I'd like to see a rules-light D&amp;D, but not a generic one. I don't think letting people play the characters they want to play is good for them; I think they should be forced to play slightly weird, discordant characters and try to make sense of them in a slightly weird, discordant world that isn't quite the world that the DM wanted to play either.<br/><br/>(I realise this post is quite design heavy and the focus in the thread is mainly on marketing, but there have been other design thoughts posted.

Or designers create the game they want rather than what the market says it wants or what market research says (when any research is done, and when it is done with out bias baked in). <br/><br/>Although many of us really like D&amp;D 4E, a lot of 4E was developed by ignoring D&amp;D's fans. So they went elsewhere. That said, they may be going to the other extreme. Designing based on fan polls. What people say they want isn't always what they actually want and what we think we want in the abstract may feel really different when we actually have it. I don't think extremes are useful as they tend to be very reactionary rather than thought out. <br/><br/>But this is a lot of conjecture, take it all with a grain of salt. That said, it's fun to talk about!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353880/#Comment_353880" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T07:32:58+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  7:32AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since this isn't Google Plus and I can't +1 Johnstone's posts, I just want to say I really like most of what he's saying.

But that's not what they're promising here, at least not from my reading. When they say stuff like "create a rule set that enables players of all types and styles to play a D&amp;D game together" it sounds like the system will actually serve different goals for different people (or, if I can say this without someone telling me I'm using it wrong, creative agendas).<br/><br/>Your example above is still serving primarily the same interests to all those people: action adventure. Sure, it scales differently in Ravenloft and Dark Sun, but you'r still basically going on adventures to defeat evil and save the world. When WotC declares they're going to be this inclusive I'm worried about them really reaching and trying to make the game modularly character-driven, or modularly small-scale. Anecdotally at least there are people who play D&amp;D to explore a character and find out what they're really about, does D&amp;DNext have a module to swap in for them?<br/><br/>The whole modular complexity, customize your game thing is great, we've seen that in Burning Wheel. And sure, they can carry that a few steps further, like Johnstone did, into character creation and so on. But Burning Wheel is still a game that really focuses on one type of play, I'm worried that D&amp;DNext won't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353896/#Comment_353896" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T08:50:33+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  8:50AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On G+, a friend asked, "what problem does D&amp;D 5E solve?"<br/><br/>For Wizards of the Coast, the problem they want to solve is, "make more money" and "make D&amp;D into a brand so we can expand outside of games." But why should any of us care about that? <br/><br/>Strangely, I personally care because I want D&amp;D to be strong so that gaming physical stores stay strong. But I'm probably in the minority. <br/><br/>D&amp;D 3E was partially successful because people loved D&amp;D but wished they had better rules (2E had great settings, problematic rules). There was a problem and Wizards provided a solution. But this is no longer the case, people who want to play D&amp;D have what they want (for the most part).<br/><br/>D&amp;D 4E fans like 4E. Fans of 3E have Pathfinder. 1E fans have a wide assortment of retro clone games, pirated scans, old books, and ebay. 2E fans moved back to 1E, forward to 3E, to Story Games, Vampire, Shadowrun, Cthulhu, Marvel or a long list of other games with rules or styles that focused on story. <br/><br/>Looking at all that, it seems the most undeserved D&amp;D audience is one that wants to play D&amp;D where the rules are story heavy. I don't know how big that audience is. After I wrote this on G+, I read...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/9329-Speak-Your-Mind-in-the-Next-Version-of-Dungeons-Dragons" rel="nofollow">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/9329-Speak-Your-Mind-in-the-Next-Version-of-Dungeons-Dragons</a>\n<blockquote>Story is going to be a focus of D&amp;D going forward.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353898/#Comment_353898" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T09:21:05+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  9:21AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a thought: what if the core isn't really a full game as such? It's just a resolution system more or less. Then you have to choose at least one module to add on to that, reflecting what the game's about: perhaps you choose from story, challenge, or exploration. To me that sounds like three different games (core+story, core+challenge, core+exploration), but that's not how they'd market it. They'd say it's all D&amp;D, all the same core.<br/><br/>Concrete example:<br/><br/>The Core is take a d20, roll it, add what the rules and GM tell you to, compare it to a number set by the GM, and six stats.<br/><br/>You then have to choose an advancement module:<br/><br/>In the story advancement module you add Beliefs to your character and get XP for dealing with them. The GM is then given some rules for how to create threats opposed to that.<br/><br/>In the exploration advancement module you pose questions about the world and get XP for answering them. The GM is given rules for creating a consistent evolving world.<br/><br/>In the challenge advancement module you get XP for defeating challenges, the amount depends on the challenge relative to your level. The GM is given rules for creating challenges.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This sounds both workable and more like what the development team is promoting, the D&amp;D for everyone. It gets around that problem of making one game that serves multiple creative agendas by making multiple games for different creative agendas and marketing them as one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353905/#Comment_353905" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T09:54:10+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  9:54AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2012 9:56AM by Nathan_H.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>On G+, a friend asked, "what problem does D&amp;D 5E solve?"</blockquote>Who is this G+ friend, 'cause he/she is like smart and stuff?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353908/#Comment_353908" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T10:02:28+00:00" title="January 11, 2012 10:02AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>- Make D&amp;D a brand.

One day at a party over my house, he saw Apocalypse World on my book shelf, ignored all of us for 3 hours and read it.

Maybe it's because I've never played 2nd Edition, but D&amp;D (as written) has always been about challenge, right? It's hard to know what they mean by saying that "Story is going to be the focus of D&amp;D going forward". I remember Mearls (I think?) talking about focusing on the "core story" of D&amp;D a lot around the time of 4th Edition's launch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353919/#Comment_353919" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T10:22:21+00:00" title="January 11, 2012 10:22AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2012 10:23AM by shreyas.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>To build on what Sage suggested, once you choose a mode you can choose expansion modules, like, exploration: sandbox, exploration: epic, challenge: epic, challenge: grimderp, or whatever you like.</p>\n<p>Each one carries a package of player character stuff (gear, character abilities, whatever) (and I think here we should stick to the D&amp;D sacred cow that is "character is interface into the fiction") and a package of DM stuff (situation builders, dungeons, set-piece monster battles, mysteries, prepackaged NPCs) that you can use to play your game.</p>\n<p>You could even pull the DIY aspect away from this (and this, if I were working with Sage on this project, is what I would do) and build preassembled, tagged <em>campaigns</em> that tell you honestly what to expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Rookspire:</em> A Gothic horror world - <em>Challenge: You're the Underdog</em></li>\n<li><em>Hawkmoor:</em> An English Countryside romance - <em>Exploration: Sandbox</em></li>\n<li><em>The Many-Colored Plague:</em> The dragons are dying out. - <em>Story: Epic / Mystery</em></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353920/#Comment_353920" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T10:49:08+00:00" title="January 11, 2012 10:49AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2012 4:28PM by ccreitz.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>On G+, a friend asked, "what problem does D&amp;D 5E solve?"</blockquote> Beyond mere greed, I think that they wish they'd made a more easily-teachable game their flagship product.

It's the kind of good idea that, in hindsight, should have been an obvious to anyone who's followed the theory discussions of the past decade - it confers much of the benefit of all that argument without dragging everyone into the swamp.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353924/#Comment_353924" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T10:59:59+00:00" title="January 11, 2012 10:59AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Thanks, Colin!</p>\n<p>I was thinking - one of the strengths of this particular community is its strong DIY ethos, but that creates an assumption that <em>everybody</em> likes to DIY.</p>\n<p>The thing is, DIY isn't great for pedagogy or accessibility - so, maybe you provide the tools to do it if you want, but you do that <em>after</em> you've demonstrated the function of the tools with fully-assembled items.

But, seeing as I'm already doing something like this for the next version of World of Algol, I obviously think it's a good idea. Is it a good idea for D&amp;D though? And hey, why not ask this one too: Is the story-games community the place to go for advice on how to make D&amp;D better?<br/><br/>If D&amp;D is gonna get back to it's "core principles" it should probably know what those are, and who is interested in them, yeah?<br/><br/>The two core pillars of D&amp;D have always been wargaming and exploration.<br/><br/>And by wargaming I mean a significant focus on combat, the use of "tournament" style rules, a referee role, maps and miniatures, and adopting various customs from actual wargaming, whether that's 70's wargaming, or MMOs and modern wargames.<br/><br/>And by exploration I mean that the DM (referee role) prepares an unfamiliar environment for the players to explore.<br/>Ken Hite has said that all versions of D&amp;D function as connective tissue between fights, but as someone who regularly plays Basic/Expert, I disagree. B/X puts the emphasis on exploring and discovering an unfamiliar environment, obtaining treasure, and preferably <i>avoiding</i> combat. But that, in some ways, is also an evolution of the pre-D&amp;D wargaming culture (The Mule Abides has a good blog post about that).<br/>(Just as an interesting point here, Call of Cthulhu takes the old-school into the mystery genre by having the players explore a prepared unfamiliar set of relationships, instead of an environment).<br/><br/>Also: The game of character-building was an emergent property of the advancement system of levels in early D&amp;D, and has become a major part of the game since 2nd edition. But it's by no means universal to all of D&amp;D. Critical to making money, yes, but not a universal D&amp;D constant.<br/><br/>Meanwhile...<br/><br/>The two pillars of the story-games community, it seems to me, are collaboratively building a setting (or genre/narrative/situation/whatever), and playing scenes. You'll notice this is exactly what Fiasco and Microscope are built for. Same with Story Now games like Spione and Apocalypse World (although AW seems to look more like D&amp;D than the others). And you just can't make D&amp;D cater to building together and playing scenes, and stay D&amp;D.* Building a setting in play and cutting/setting scenes both work against exploring unfamiliar stuff that another participant has prepared. I mean, would YOU listen to people whose priorities aren't compatible with yours when you're designing a game?<br/><br/>* Or... maybe you can? Obviously lots of people here play other games, and I see people playing Magic and board games at Go Play Northwest and I played and ran at least one game (each) that catered to those two D&amp;D pillars at Fabricated Realities. So it seems ike there's a broad knowledge of different games amongst the story-games, along with a lot of game designers designing very different games.

Granted, it's weaker to do this than to use a game that has mechanics that explicitly enable those styles, but it is something.  I think this is a big part of the old cult of the DM, when a DM takes a ruleset and tailors it to serve the agenda of the others at the table.<br/><br/>As for whether you can design for multiple simultaneous creative agendas -- consider Mouse Guard, which explicitly alternates between GM-driven exploration and PC-driven story.<br/><br/>Actually, I think that the Burning games have already achieved a lot of the things that 5E is driving at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353951/#Comment_353951" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T13:00:53+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  1:00PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone, if we agree that challenge and exploration, phrased in those ways, really are the core of D&amp;D, that's awesome. I agree that those are what I see in D&amp;D. My thought, based on WotC's comments so far and their monetary mandate to rule the market, is that they want to embrace all the other things that roleplaying games have become, and D&amp;D has kind of dipped into. Kingdom management in Dragonlance, character driven "we didn't even use the dice!" play, all that.<br/><br/>So I see a few options:<br/><br/>WotC knows what D&amp;D is about and is willing to make a game about that with modular systems that add weight as needed. This results in a D&amp;D that's kind of like Burning Wheel: it's always about whatever WotC thinks D&amp;D is, but your group can decide how deep to go into certain systems and subsystems.<br/><br/>WotC knows that D&amp;D is many things to many people and essentially makes multiple games under the same name. To avoid fracturing the audience they call it all D&amp;D but you have to choose from among different modules to make your D&amp;D (i.e. narrow down what kind of D&amp;D this is). This is probably what I find most exciting, at the moment.<br/><br/>WotC knows that D&amp;D is many things to many people and makes one game with modular systems to add weight as needed. This is the worst result I can see. This is the version of D&amp;D where we basically get, say, Beliefs tacked on to a game that has nothing to do with character development of that sort, just because you decided to add the Beliefs module. It's a game that claims you can do everything with it but either facilitates none of that or only facilitates one mode of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bent" title="Bent"><img alt="Bent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.sporecloud.com/Images/TinySelf.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bent">Bent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353955/#Comment_353955" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T13:14:34+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  1:14PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>The two core pillars of D&amp;D have always been wargaming and exploration.</blockquote>\nI've been mulling over what the 'core' of D&amp;D is over the last couple of days. What makes D&amp;D different than other fantasy RPGs? Certainly it has had many competitors over the years, though more imitators than serious alternatives. I think it's hard to be totally objective here, because if you've read any comment sections of articles about the 5e announcement, you'll see a bunch of screeching, anonymous knobs defending each edition as the one true D&amp;D. Who's right? No one and everyone. I started pondering about the game's core qualities when I was first playing 4e and feeling that it had stripped out a lot of what I thought made D&amp;D distinct, and it is distinct, even if a lot of its qualities aren't exactly intentional. It's got a huge amount of character hanging off of it. It's an ugly mutant that has undergone a lot of changes but has survived. It sort of works. It's like a lovable pug, a breed so inbred that it sneezes on its own eyeballs but somehow remains lovable to many people.<br/><br/>The core components of D&amp;D, to me, are:<br/>1) A class system with complimentary, often mutually exclusive roles and different tactical requirements and gameplay opportunities. I think everything in D&amp;D flows out from the four basic character classes of fighter, thief, cleric, and wizard. <br/>2) A complex rule set for combat that may not be immediately accessible to new players, but that offers good tactical variety and makes heavy use of the classes' differences and abilities. I think making a rules-light combat system for D&amp;D would kill it. Just because something is complicated doesn't mean it's not worth learning.<br/>3) A unique magic system with a mix of spells, both combat and utility, that add flavour to the roleplay, reward improvisation, and add choices to the combat. A lot of the spells in D&amp;D have developed an identity of their own, which I think is overlooked. Spells like magic missile, fireball, stinking cloud are iconic, in a way. I seem to be pretty much alone in this, but I think the memorization rules are great, too, and create a unique type of gameplay.<br/>4) Also iconic, the D&amp;D bestiary. You've got the proprietary beasties like Mind Flayers and Beholders, but even the dragons and the giants have been given a readily identifiable character in D&amp;D and have influenced their portrayals elsewhere. There are a lot of flat out dumb monsters, too, but I think that's something to embrace.<br/>5) This one is a little iffy, but it's one of my favourite, weird aspects of D&amp;D: Alignment.<br/><br/>One might argue that levels and experience points, magic items, ability scores and character races are fundamentals, too. They probably are, but I think they've always been pretty half-assed, no matter how much the extant editions have relied on them. I think these could be heavily altered and the game's heart remain intact. If you remove or dilute the core components I list above, however, I think the character of the game is greatly diminished.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353965/#Comment_353965" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T13:53:34+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  1:53PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2012 1:57PM by ccreitz.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bent</cite>2) A complex rule set for combat that may not be immediately accessible to new players, but that offers good tactical variety and makes heavy use of the classes' differences and abilities.

(3e kind of did this, but not in a principled or well-organized way)<br/>What if combat started out somewhat complex, but taught improved tactics with increased level? (4e is pretty good at this!)<br/>What if combat was simple, but there were rules plug-ins that added complexity? (Think AD&amp;D, AD&amp;D + Skills and Powers, AD&amp;D + Combat and Tactics)<br/>What if combat started out simple, but the players could choose to escalate the complexity, which would unlock additional options for the DM as well?<br/>What if the combat rules were simple, but gave rise to complex epiphenomena, like the rules of Go or Chess?<br/><br/>I think that keeping combat tactically interesting need not get in the way of improving the game's accessibility. I love the idea of coming up with rules as simple, yet rich, as Go's, although I don't know how you'd do that and keep appropriate flavor. (In the back of my head, though, I keep coming back to Backgammon...) As things stand, the combat rules-plex strikes me as the highest barrier to entry in D&amp;D, once you've gotten to the point where you're even thinking about the rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353974/#Comment_353974" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T14:16:36+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  2:16PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite><br/>WotC knows that D&amp;D is many things to many people and makes one game with modular systems to add weight as needed.

I think challenge is something that goes along with the character-building game quite well, which is why you can see it in Burning Wheel, which is a game about characters and actively undermines exploration. But yeah, in a broader context it might work to also encompass that early tournament style of game and both the antagonistic puzzle-presenting DM stance and the impartial referee DM stance in old-school play (both of which can also run exploration/sandbox style games).<br/><br/>Will D&amp;D still be good if it branches out, though? I mean, Burning Wheel is about challenge+character, and actively undermines exploration. If D&amp;D or a version of D&amp;D prioritizes character (building) and de-emphasizes exploration, why wouldn't I just play Burning Wheel (and a lot of Burning Wheel players have already answered that question for themselves). Same goes for other modes. I can see the appeal (and business sense) of adding stuff to the challenge+exploration=adventure formula, but not so much that of adpating it to "all things roleplaying has become." I am not Business Guy, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353975/#Comment_353975" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T14:17:31+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  2:17PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, I'll give you those five points, but those are all core aspects of the game as experienced from the player's perspective only.

It would both validate a lot of what indie games have been doing (it is saying that rules matter, in a way) and undermine it completely (if D&amp;D does cater to the BW playstyle, even if it doesn't do it as well, there's less to differentiate BW).<br/><br/>As for challenge, I meant challenge as in testing your skill (at playing your character and making a survivable character). The adversarial sort. Of course challenge is useful in many other ways, and BW totally challenges beliefs, so I should have been clearer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354007/#Comment_354007" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T17:22:48+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  5:22PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like there's a public playtest of the "new iteration" at D&amp;D Experience at the end of the month, so at least we won't have long to wait.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354034/#Comment_354034" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-12T03:51:06+00:00" title="January 12, 2012  3:51AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2012 3:52AM by Teataine.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And the game will go into a full-on open beta in spring, so we'll all have the chance to dissect it in person. At the moment, based on what I've heard, I think there's an 80% chance I'm going to switch my current Pathfinder campaign into the 5E Beta. I'm not sure if it will make my players happy but it certainly sounds a lot closer to what I want as a DM.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now, back to the original purpose of the thread, I don't think WotC's current problem is one of <i>design</i> as much as one of <i>marketing</i> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeFV5GprfaQ" rel="nofollow">comedy analogy</a>). So I don't think designing a new game, no matter how good it would be is the real solution to their predicament.<br/><br/><b>However</b>, at this point the whole thing is too far gone to remedy it just by switching their marketing around. So publishing a new iteration of the game is a necessary thing they have to do, to reboot their business model. If they end up making a better game at the same time, everyone wins.<br/><br/>Finally, I think Johnstone knows what he's talking about really well. I agree with pretty much everything of what he's saying. And while the official press release they put out does indeed sound like they're going for a muddled design, as Sage fears, I think Mearls' earlier Legends and Lore articles (pre-Monte columns) indicate something more along the lines of what Johnstone was proposing on the previous page.<br/><br/>That is: I think (hope) they realize that it's an adventure game, with exploration and combat and they'll design around that. They'll just put in varying degrees of complexity (like the Hub-Spokes-Rim thing in BW) with various toggles (frex whether you use a grid for combat or not). This more open structure will satisfy DIY oldschoolers, and I expect the D&amp;DNext "Hub" will bear some resemblance to the "white box" in terms of its simplicity and openness. At the same time, the option of playing "without combat" (or rather with vastly simplified combat) will convince the epic/romance/dragonlance people to take a second look, the game might not be designed for their creative agenda, but it will probably with them as customers anyway. As for the narrativist side of things, I don't think D&amp;D will do that, nor I think it should.<br/><br/>But yeah, let's wait a little longer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15594/congratulations-welcome-to-the-d-d-design-team" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15594/congratulations-welcome-to-the-d-d-design-team" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15594/congratulations-welcome-to-the-d-d-design-team/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15594/congratulations-welcome-to-the-d-d-design-team/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15594/congratulations-welcome-to-the-d-d-design-team/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15594%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15594%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Congratulations!

Part of this interacting is listening. And what I hear a lot is people really like the games Wizards makes. Some people who hate on 4E don't actually dislike it. But saying "4E sucks" has for some become code for "I don't trust Wizards anymore."<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Note, none of this is the fault of any 1 person. And I feel many people are unfairly blamed. That said, there have been a lot of trust breaking mishaps in the last few years:<br/><br/><br/><br/>- D&amp;D 4E had extensive playtests. A lot of the playtest feedback revealed what we now know to be problems with 4E. What happened? Wizards just revealed that for unspecified reasons, 4E playtest feedback was largely ignored and tossed aside.<br/><br/>- Wizards ensured fans that D&amp;D 4E wasn't mainly MMO inspired. Turns out, according to Dancy, their explicit internal goal was to make 4E MMO like and best played with the DDI so that when Hasbro gets back the D&amp;D video game rights, they could convert DDI users into MMO users. <br/><br/>- Wizards sudden release of D&amp;D 3.5 made many 3E books incompatible and left many retailers with books they couldn't sell.<br/><br/>- Before 4E came out, Wizards claimed a new edition wasn't coming out, then announced it was.<br/><br/>- Wizards said 4E would have some sort of OGL support. Then it didn't. Then the GSL, which replaced the OGL, seemed to be written to discourage 3rd Party Support.<br/><br/>- The 4E books promised digital tools and features, advertised in the core books themselves, that were never released. After months and months of promises, delays, promises, then nothing.<br/><br/>- Wizards cancelled the much loved print version of Dragon magazine. This and the GSL seemed to abandon much loved companies like Paizo who fans did trust.<br/><br/>- Wizards suddenly cancelled sales of PDFs with little explanation. It was alluded that they may sell them in other forms but it never happened.<br/><br/>- Fans voiced concerns that D&amp;D was becoming a card game. Then Wizards released booster packs for D&amp;D.<br/><br/>- Fans feared D&amp;D was becoming a miniature game. Then Wizards designed 4E to require the use of minis.<br/><br/>- D&amp;D was bombarded by constant changes &amp; errata. With so much focus and hype around balanced rules, it made many wonder how balanced and playtested the game really was. Which is even more confusing given that they ignored the massive 4E playtest data they received.<br/><br/>- The 4E announcements mocked (in a funny way) aspects of 3E which was loved by many of their fans.<br/><br/>- Wizards claimed they were going to streamline rules like grapple but streamlining turned out to be mostly gutting the rules. <br/><br/>- The RPGA was forced to abandon their existing games and characters.<br/><br/>- Suing fans.<br/><br/>- Making rules advice online that used to be free only accessible with a paid subscription.<br/><br/>- Requiring you to pay additional money for advice on how to use problematic rules like Skill Challenges rather than making it free as part of the errata. <br/><br/>- Releasing a D&amp;D Red Box with the promise of nostalgia art. But when you open the box, it turns out the nostalgia was mostly marketing, little substance.<br/><br/>- Releasing a starter set to introduce D&amp;D to new gamers that ended up not being compatible with the rest of the rules as advertised in the starter set itself.<br/><br/>- Suddenly changing the DDI tools so you couldn't use them offline. They claimed minor changes were coming. Then there were delays after delays with no promised updates for months. Meanwhile customers were paying for this software every month. Then when the updates came, they were only available with the new software. And initially that software was buggy, so more delays.<br/><br/>- Staffing their booths at conventions with outside PR firms who barely know what D&amp;D is. <br/><br/>- Releasing Essentials which wasn't a new edition but had enough changes that some of your old books were outdated. It also meant many fans re-bought the core books twice in less than 4 years. And now we have a new edition and soon even more books. Granted, Essentials is a fantastic game that fixes almost all of 4E's problems but many didn't give it a try because of all the confusion. <br/><br/><br/><br/>These are just some of the complaints and trust breaking issues people tell me. People who like 4E but stopped buying anything Wizards. We had local events where people gave away all their 4E books and announced, "it's time to support a company that supports us." And switched to Pathfinder. <br/><br/>I know people who play Pathfinder that don't even like the rules. But they like and trust Paizo, the company behind that Pathfinder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's not all just about the rules. They get a lot of attention through word of mouth but many people feel burned, so they don't say nice things. Granted, people will always say bad things and you can't please everyone. But even people who normally say nice things aren't. <br/><br/><br/>I hope Wizards shows everyone that their playtesting matters and start building trust back up again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354038/#Comment_354038" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-12T07:04:39+00:00" title="January 12, 2012  7:04AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone wishing to trust a business is a fool, so chasing their desires is fruitless.

If someone offers you something at a price you deem worth it, where's the antagonism there?<br/><br/>Within the larger non-zero-sum interaction of "I would rather have this purchase than my money", sure, there is a zero-sum interaction of "<i>exactly</i> how much money each of us can get".  But to reduce the entire transaction to that is to punt all context out the window.<br/><br/>My take on buying complicated entertainment tools like RPGs is that, if the cover price isn't a big deal for you, you just buy it and see, and if the cover price is a big deal for you, then you read the thing and assess it as well as you can before considering purchase.  In the former, trust is unnecessary, and in the latter, trust is earned by the product itself.  And if you do care about cost but can't assess a game from reading it, well, that's what an internet full of reviews is for, right?<br/><br/>When I hear that D&amp;D has broken fans' trust, all that means to me is that more people will actually try to assess their products pre-purchase rather than just throwing money at anything with a D&amp;D logo on it.  To re-establish the expectation that anything with a D&amp;D label on it will be quality, there's only one possible solution -- make everything with a D&amp;D label on it be quality.  In the meantime, folks who want to throw $30 at some unknown thing that <i>might</i> be fun have a larger field to consider (Hi, Dresden!).<br/><br/>If "make it all quality" in this case is an unattainable goal due to different audience members' criteria for "quality", then that is what it is, and I'd guess that there's nothing D&amp;D can do about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354360/#Comment_354360" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T13:42:28+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  1:42PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>If someone offers you something at a price you deem worth it, where's the antagonism there?</blockquote>\nThen they are my antagonist, "Damn, why didn't I gouge him for more money, I mean ask for more money?"

I've managed to get together a group of old grognards, one of indie gamers, and one of complete beginners with a home made scenario using the Microlite20 rules. D&amp;D has never worked so smoothly for me. Lots of fun, with the caveat that I didn't try to go beyond the basic activity of old D&amp;D; enter the dungeon, explore, negotiate, subvert the scenery, kill, plunder, get out alive.<br/><br/>So I'd start with something <a href="http://arthur.jfmi.net/Microlite20.pdf" rel="nofollow">that's an improvement on this</a> - two pages, or maybe even less, of instructions which someone who knows the basics of the game can use to assemble a game. Then I'd add another pdf explaining how this is compatible, or can be made compatible, with all previous material. It's quite easy if you just tell people what to use and what to ignore, rather than give them hours of math homework. And make all the old stuff available for purchase as pdfs.<br/><br/>Then I'd make one cheap booklet with these basics, and put it in a box with lots of maps, blank character sheets and other goodies. Then start selling booklets crammed with setting, characters, scenarios, add-on tactical options, and lenses/skins/whatever for the basic rules. Worked for SJGames, though I'm not sure if it's still working - how is e23 and w23 doing these days? Give the booklets a comic book issue scale and publication schedule to keep people coming back for more. And for Krampus' sake, hire the best writers and artists you can trick into putting their name on this thing and let them do their job without any number crunching and GM instructions carving up the colour material. Put that in a separate section in the back or something.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, why am I not doing this right now?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354461/#Comment_354461" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T08:48:37+00:00" title="January 16, 2012  8:48AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

Again, imagine a game where one player has a simple character sheet that has just a few things noted on it, and the player next to him has all sorts of skills, feats, and special abilities. And yet they can still play the game together and everything remains relatively balanced. Your 1E-loving friend can play in your 3E-style game and not have to deal with all the options he or she doesn't want or need. Or vice versa. It's all up to you to decide. </blockquote>\nI think it's cool to see them being so ambitious, and I'm curious to see where it goes.  <br/><br/>Design thoughts:<br/><br/>1. The seeds of simple character sheet vs. complex character sheet are already in 4E.  There's an optional section in there somewhere (DMG2?) that sums up the expected bonuses characters should achieve at every level from their powers, attributes, magic items, etc.<br/><br/>2. Balancing all the gamist stuff in 5E (assuming that game balance is a D&amp;D sacred cow) is gonna be huge fun for the designers.  If each character can opt into different physics, then physics will be just another variable to optimize.  I can imagine the optimization boards now: the ultimate first-level elf battle wizard must opt into the Powers module, but a 16th-level elf battle wizard should go Vancian because <i>power word kill</i> and <i>polymorph other</i>.<br/><br/>2.5. Will game physics even be a customizable thing?  Or will the customizations just all be different ways of addressing one consistent set of underlying physics?  Will the game allow you to have a Vancian caster and a Powers caster in the same party?<br/><br/>3. I can imagine narrative modules being hyperoptional.  For instance, if I want to kit out my 5E PC with Beliefs and Instincts but another players at the table isn't into that, then that doesn't exclude us from playing with each other.  I'm just going to have more story and reward opportunities than they are.  Maybe the non-narrativist player will receive default rewards in lieu of the specific rewards that I get.<br/><br/>4. I wonder if this new edition is going to be strictly inward-looking, with their palette of ideas and implementations being constrained by all the stuff that's been in D&amp;D.  Or will they look outward for inspiration, for ways to better achieve certain modes of D&amp;D?  It'd be cool to see Keys in there.<br/><br/>5. While I'm wishing, it would also be cool to see mechanics that enable players to compel the DM to cater to their play-style, to subvert the idea of the GM as a lonely auteur who is entirely responsible for the experience.<br/><br/>6. On that thought, I suspect that in the majority of play groups, the GM will codify the options that are supported in their campaigns.  Just like there are campaigns today that run with specific DM-created worlds with constraints on race, religion, class, etc, there will be campaigns tomorrow that specify "no tabletop miniature rules allowed, no feats allowed, you must use point-allocated skills instead of trained skills."  This might be a useful formalization to help players and DMs understand if they're compatible!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354490/#Comment_354490" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T12:45:26+00:00" title="January 16, 2012 12:45PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2012 2:43PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason's got the right of it.<br/><br/>It exists primarily to subvert referent systems (ie normal everyday knowledge.)<br/><br/>So, there exist multiple referent systems (aka cultures of play) around D&amp;D. These are mostly based around playing the game. Referent systems tend to be cobbled from experiences, including the experience of texts, etc. The referent system is partially shared and seems more or less nature. That's the way the game works, that's what the game is, duh, I know because I was there doing that thing and other people where there too and they agreed with me. So, that's basic social constructivism. Not really all that controversial these days. <br/><br/>Now marketing wants subvert this system of referents (or normal everyday knowledge) such that you purchase the product. They do that lots of different ways. The effect is to slip in the product into these systems seamlessly. \\<br/><br/>Fr'ex: going from not knowing what a cell phone is to not being able to live without one.<br/><br/>Also see that famous Mad Men scene about the slide projector and fatherhood: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2bLNkCqpuY" rel="nofollow">The Carousel.</a><br/><br/>Now, slide projectors have nothing really to do with families or fatherhood or whatever. They display pictures on a screen from slides. But marketing aims to make them seem like a deeply affective and desirable part of family life. But they're not. I mean, not really. Besides, the notion that a slide projector makes you a better father is crazy. And yet.<br/><br/>So, the knowledge of family life, if you're Jason, is destroyed. But it's a double-step, it's destroyed then recreated with slight but critical modifications. Ones which include the product being in your life. <br/><br/>What Wizard's is trying to do is destroy the knowledge that there has always been different editions of D&amp;D that have different play styles and different priorities, etc, and say: "Really, don't we all want to play the same game, together, like friends, like we use to? Remember, back before all this fighting and editions? Wouldn't that be great? And <i>everyone</i> will have fun!" The later is patently impossible but the realm of marketing is always impossible desire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354494/#Comment_354494" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T12:58:56+00:00" title="January 16, 2012 12:58PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm actually excited now!<br/><br/>A long time ago, we used to run D&amp;D games with an incredibly wide range of playstyles where we allowed different people to access different parts of the rules. Classes in different versions of D&amp;D already do this. In D&amp;D 2E, if you don't want to think too much, just play a Fighter. If you want more rules complexity, play a Magic user. If you want to engage the skill system, play a Thief. If you just want to hang out and help your friends, play the Cleric. If you wanted to roleplay a lot, play a Paladin or Bard. Some characters use the map for tactical positioning and bonuses, some just roll dice and roleplay the results. <br/><br/>But there were problems:<br/><br/>For example, if one person can roleplay their way out of a fight, that ruins the chance for another player to have fun with tactics in combat.<br/><br/>Another huge problem, was GMing. Keeping track of everything and everyone can be a nightmare. You can compensate for this when the rules are self contained. I don't need to know the advanced magic rules if they are written in a way where the Wizard is the one who makes all the rolls and just tells me what happens. Kind of like in Apocalypse World. Make your Move, let the GM know what it says to do next. But if I have to prepare an adventure that speaks to all these different play styles... it's already challenging just making a balanced combat encounter... now imagine throwing 5 other things into the process. And what will published scenarios / adventures look like? Will they go from 30 pages to 90 for the same amount of content?<br/><br/>But it's an exciting challenge. What if they can pull it off? That would be a useful tool in the RPG tool box. <br/><br/>I also agree with Jason. It could just be marketing hype. But I hope not!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354886/#Comment_354886" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T14:47:55+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  2:47PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2012 2:50PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've never lacked the ability for one player to indulge in crunchy min-maxing while another stays system-lite to focus on roleplay or fictional positioning.

Good DMs already consider players\u2019 different tastes within a single group; single groups tend to codify themselves around a particular culture of play.  It\u2019s already jarring to leave one D&amp;D group\u2019s playstyle for another\u2019s\u2014everyone\u2019s been doing it differently forever and always\u2014so making this a conceit of the newest version could increase the cognitive dissonance dramatically.  Acknowledging it is good, however, and catering to it might mean that the long-running culture of play is maintained with positive results.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>I don't follow D&amp;D news, but it seems to me that<i>if</i>they're focusing on the relationship<i>between each player and the game</i>, they're fighting a losing battle against video games. Focusing on the relationships<i>between players</i>is necessary to make the most out of the tabletop medium.</blockquote>\nThis is an important point\u2014I\u2019ve been tempted to start a discussion about it.  Table-top roleplaying games can\u2019t compete head-to-head with videogames like Skyrim if they\u2019re expected to deliver content on a similar scale.  They can\u2019t compete with \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d or \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d (books or films, take your pick) in delivering a sweeping, unified narrative.  What they can do is facilitate communication, collaboration, competition, and character-driven content created by the players.  Playing up what makes roleplaying games more than simply entertainment seems best for their lasting health.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354903/#Comment_354903" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-18T16:50:04+00:00" title="January 18, 2012  4:50PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2012 4:50PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>they will bore the fuck out of each other</blockquote>\nYes yes YES.

The D&amp;D folks could pin down what each edition is good at and make a play preferences questionnaire that slots players into the best fit for them.  <br/><br/>D&amp;D5, rather than a blend of 1e thru 4e, would be filling whatever niche 1e thru 4e don't serve.  Adding another option to the menu.  "Discovery and immersion", "the GM's plot", "Cthulhu with swords", "court intrigue", or whatever a lot of D&amp;D players want but don't reliably get from any previous edition.  (The key word being <i>reliably</i>.  D&amp;D2 gets used for all of my examples!  But how fragile is success, and how much does the game really help?)<br/><br/>That's what I'd do.  I hope they don't, though, so there's more of a void left in the hobby for indies and the stuff I hope to publish.  :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15594/congratulations-welcome-to-the-d-d-design-team/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15594/congratulations-welcome-to-the-d-d-design-team">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15594/congratulations-welcome-to-the-d-d-design-team/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15594/congratulations-welcome-to-the-d-d-design-team/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15594%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15594%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
