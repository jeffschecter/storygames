I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Design-Development-Series-Charles/dp/1584503548" rel="nofollow">this book</a> a while back that does pretty much the same thing for computer games.<br/><br/>So if I was telling someone how to get started in design, I would start with what Jason says - "play lots of different games". But I would add to that the message: "and look for patterns in them and connections between them".<br/><br/>First, look at patterns and design elements in the core mechanical aspects and how those parts interact with each other.<br/><br/>Then look at how patterns and design elements start to drive emergent properties that may not be obvious from a pure mechanical interaction standpoint.<br/><br/>Once you start being able to see how a game does that, then it's mostly just a matter of practice. And I don't mean practice in terms of just acquiring initial proficiency. I mean practice the way one practices meditation or martial arts or yoga or painting or knitting - a state of continuous growth through the thoughtful repeated application of skill and technique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405482/#Comment_405482" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T10:43:57+00:00" title="February  5, 2013 10:43AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2013 4:27AM by Upstart.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I started out because trad games were too complicated for me.

This stuff is so subjective it's really difficult to say who's good and who's not. <br/><br/>It's weird. My appreciation for musicians grew when I started to play piano. But the more I design, the more I consider RPG designers, even famous ones, as just people who like the same hobby. I guess it's all about the lack of exection level: you can design a game, and bam, you basically have it. Of course you have to write it down, but I consider that a different skill, which you can have without knowing anything about game design. But even if I have a kickass melody playing in my head, I can't just play it like that and expect it to sound professional. That requires some skills in composition, because the lead melody isn't the song, or especially the arrangement, or the production. <br/><br/>Incidentally, there are many classic games which get criticized a lot for their actual game design, but maintain their classic status because of their evocative writing                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405483/#Comment_405483" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T10:52:39+00:00" title="February  5, 2013 10:52AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to think of game design as a more specific branch of something we might call "social interaction design," which includes all sorts of stuff from urban planning to human-computer interfaces. Basically, you have to spend a lot of time examining human behavior and then experiment with structuring it in different ways (through game design) to create interesting interactions. There's lots of ways to approach this! You can study it academically (what do people want? how do they behave?), you can do a lot of trial and error, you can draw on your own personal experiences, etc. I think the most important things are to:<br/><br/><b>1. Play a lot of different games.</b> Like, at least a dozen new games every year, if not more.<br/><b>2. Play some games a lot.</b> Many games reward long-term play and exploration, revealing new insights.<br/><b>3. Make a lot of different games.</b> Work seriously on at least a half-dozen every year, if not more.<br/><b>4. Play some of your games a lot.</b> Many of your games will be crap, but others will turn into worthwhile things. Play the crap out of them until you figure out how to get them to do what you want. But don't be afraid to decide something isn't working and abandon it permanently or temporarily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405484/#Comment_405484" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T10:54:47+00:00" title="February  5, 2013 10:54AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I forgot one:<br/><br/><b>5.

Talk with people about games. One thing I noticed is more common with board gamers than roleplaying gamers is that the first group sit afterwards and analyse the game. This rarely happens after a session of roleplaying games has ended, even if I've been blessed with this with my last two groups.<br/><br/>Two sites that I'm ploughing through right now are:<br/><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/design/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gamasutra.com/features/design/</a><br/><a href="http://www.psychologyofgames.com/archives/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.psychologyofgames.com/archives/</a><br/><br/>I feel that reading about board- and card game design (especially the psychology behind it) gives me more than reading about roleplaying design.

I happened to play Paranoia and Toon a lot, at the time. I was on a huge Three Stooges kick, too... and, thus <i>Three Stooges Roleplaying</i> was born: a d30, stats+comprehensive stat-derived skills (like Toon), PC v PC (designed from beginning to be two teams of three players in opposition plus a GM or two). It was never more than a print-out off my Commodore 64.<br/><br/>I discovered Shadowrun, but thought it had too many moving parts and exceptions to its various systems... so I wrote a "Unifier" rule set for it. SR2E basically followed my own thinking, years later. I never published, nor even use it outside of a private campaign, but I knew I was thinking in the same design space as "the pros."<br/><br/>I discovered Icehouse pieces, and Icehousegames.org. There was no crunchy RPG using the pieces, so I made Stacktors. It is still online, in beta, completely untested. [I made other, board games; but that's a totally different inspiration and development process.]<br/><br/>I discovered LARP. Time passed and I discovered boffer LARP. I played in two different systems which were "broken D&amp;D copies" and drove me crazy for four or five major design reasons. I went home and thought... and discovered The Forge and thought... and outlined and spreadsheeted and wrote. From that, GLASS was born. It is lightly tested, in Gold Master for system test.<br/>---<br/>Conclusion: I saw niches and filled them; or I saw problems and re-designed from the ground up to avoid them while preserving the intent or mode of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405502/#Comment_405502" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T14:21:32+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  2:21PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>... you need to know how games work.</blockquote>\nCould we unpack this statement a little bit?

It is not so much seeing the comparisons and being aware of the differences, but being aware of the 'Why'. This will help reinforce design decisions that you choose to make later on. Listen in on people at your gaming table and ask why they liked that particular feature, or what they thought was useful about it.<br/>For example, I did some work and threw up a Dark Heresy hack to run Shin Megami Tensei: Persona. I chose to turn the light/dark spells into damage dealers, rather than the instakills of the video game series, but also made all the elements effectively the same, with the differentiation being using the DH weapon properties. The resounding table opinion was that it made things easier, and better to remember. They checked the spell level and knew the numbers, which in a very crunchy system like DH is a godsend.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it comes with noting the differences between games and comparing them.<br/>Eg:<br/>Fiasco and D&amp;D sit at very far ends on pretty much all scales (Short form vs long form, Story game vs. Trad and a bushel of others). However, both of them use character differentiation mechanics. We all know that these are things utilised by many RPGs. They stop players at the table from feeling like they are blending into eachother, helps set up a productive narrative space for gaming, helps define how the player interacts with the world and others and encourages particular dynamics at the table during the game.<br/><br/>D&amp;D has possibly the most traditional of these mechanics, the race and class. It gives the player a 'job', something that they do in the world. It affects their skills and abilities, thereby encouraging them to interact with the world in particular ways. However, outside of particular niche cases (Such as the Paladin in some editions, who had to have a particular alignment considered, to the extent that D&amp;D has roleplaying mechanics, to be the closest thing to it) it mandates very little about background, outlook or relationships. Bob the Fighter is likely going to be good at hitting things with weapons, probably quite strong and/or dextrous and he has little need for smarts, though he might have them in some corner cases. However, he could be a street thug or a nightwatchman or a knight in shining armour. Just knowing he is Bob the Fighter tells you a lot about what he can DO, but not a lot about who he IS. This makes sense given the design goals of D&amp;D. <br/><br/>Fiasco has a character differentiation mechanic in the form of Relationships and Needs. It is unlikely that players at the table share these, and in essence, they function as the 'race and class' of Fiasco. Within the game design goals here, however, the Relationships and Needs tell you very little about what your character can DO, but a lot about who they ARE. Many relationships may hint at some kind of profession, which would inform that - 'Newly Minted Gangsters' from the Saturday Night 78 playset comes to mind - but are often fairly loose in general. These gangsters could have any kind of background, training or proficiency, much how a D&amp;D street thug could be a fighter, rogue, etc.<br/><br/>Edit (For clarity): These decisions inform players how then to interact with the game and other players at the table. Within play, the status or ability granted you by the things you receive here affect progression and change the focus of the entire game as a whole, as players exploit the hooks given to them.<br/><br/>While the two games at a large scale may seem very different beasts, and certainly play very differently, getting down to a microscopic level and really unpicking the stitches to see what bits go where, why, how that lets you accomplish what the game wants to do can be very useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405520/#Comment_405520" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T16:45:05+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  4:45PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason and Jonathan have nailed it.<br/><br/>Also, especially if you're designing RPGs, read <i>every single</i> post here: <a href="http://lumpley.com/toc.php?by=cats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lumpley.com/toc.php?by=cats</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405521/#Comment_405521" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T17:20:56+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  5:20PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In other words, I want to apply gamification to my studies and work that involves using more than stupid badges, and my inclination is learning how to analyze what games tick - and how games change the way people tick - is the best way to do that.</blockquote>\nCould you tell us more about how you want to apply game design?<br/><br/>From what I know - I searched the literature during my psychology MSc - there isn't much evidence that gamification works or that games produce beneficial effects.

In other words, I want to apply gamification to my studies and work that involves using more than stupid badges, and my inclination is learning how to analyze what games tick - and how games change the way people tick - is the best way to do that.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nA lot of my game design consulting work is in the gamification world. And I work with the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab on some interesting behavior change work. So I can speak a bit about that. <br/><br/>If you want to be a game designer, people have already given great advice about playing lots of different games (not just RPGs or card games or board games) and deconstructing them. Every great game can be improved in some way, and every crap game has something interesting in it. Try to squint your eyes a bit at the genre tropes and get at the underlying mechanics in the games. <br/><br/>But influencing human behavior is something else entirely. You need to start with an end goal in mind. What is your intention? What does success look like? The you need to look at the commonalities of the current interactions and where they are falling short. Look for the possible trigger points where you can have a real effect on behavior, even if its a small one. Set a call-to-action that is easy to do and difficult to say "no" to. Have a way to track the behaviors so you can see what is working and where you need to improve. <br/><br/>Doing this doesn't require game design or necessarily building a game around it. But understanding the principles of what makes some games tick is very useful. Engagement loops, trigger points, baby steps. <br/><br/>You might find this <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/StephanieSpong/20121023/180007/Interview_with_Game_Designer_Chris_Bennett_Connect_People_Design_Experiences_Use_Baby_Steps_Just_Dont_Put_Game_Lipstick_on_a_Pigquot.php" rel="nofollow">interview</a> interesting. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405540/#Comment_405540" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T21:25:42+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  9:25PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2013 9:27PM by Zelbinian.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Could you tell us more about how you want to apply game design?<br/><br/>From what I know - I searched the literature during my psychology MSc - there isn't much evidence that gamification works or that games produce beneficial effects.
