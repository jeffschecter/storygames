                    Time to see TORG get Awesome-O-Fied<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.pen-paper.net/images/rpgdb/weg20501.jpg"/> <br/><br/><b>The Possibilities Wars are here!</b> Well, they're kinda stuck in the early 90s, actually, but you get the picture. <br/><br/>Restating the Rules/Conventions of Awesome-O-Fied discussions:<br/><br/><b>Purpose:</b> You all know what happened with Battlestar Galactica. That corny sf period-piece got not only a facelift, but an entire re-imagination almost from scratch. Most of the character names were the same, and the Cylon Threat remained, but after that it was basically put through some really creative gymnastics, and what emerged was awesome, pure awesome. Well, much of that is the screenwriting and direction, but still, you get my point.<br/><br/><b>Conventions:</b> If you're tangentially familiar with the setting, that we get a brainstorm session together to think of some things that would awesome-o-fy the setting. Just list some ideas or statements out. <br/>* You do not have to build upon yourself or any other ideas (but you can if you want)<br/>* You are absolutely free to contradict or ignore other ideas on the thread (but again, you can expound further on them if you want). <br/>* Even in your own post, you are free to contradict yourself (or build upon yourself). <br/><br/>It's not group setting building, it's simply brainstorming.<br/><br/>In previous Awesome-O-Fied threads, we stuck mainly to the setting, and coming up with setting mods and tweaks.  TORG, for all it was, was a couple settings in one. Feel free to take on any individual sub-setting of TORG, Core Earth, or the Whole Shebang. Also, if you have rules ideas (like "Using entirely new rules"), that's cool too.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Pulled from the Lame Realization thread:<br/><br/>-----------<br/>Mark: I've lately been toying with trying to FATE-ify it, but it would be a lot of work.<br/><br/>Judd: Giving the different world different blank aspects that the players can hit could work well.<br/>-----------<br/><br/>Sure, it's more of a focus on rules instead of core setting, which the other threads have traditionally been about.  But at the core of TORG was this HUGE logarithmic system which was modified slightly each time a hero stepped in or out of another realm. Also, it featured crazy-ass complicated rules for restoring reality (or changing reality) back to the way it was. FATE could do this with a few aspects per realm. Core Earth could have the aspect "Wants to regain its core reality", or else "Accepting of other realities", depending on whether or not you wanted it to be really hard to turn back an invasion.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            It's tough for me to awesome-ify TORG because I think it's plenty awesome already.  <br/><br/>I mean, it's pretty coherent.  Its canonical adventure design (like a video game, first you fight lackeys, then middle managers, then big baddies) is reinforced by the card mechanics.  There are loads of pre-programmed Things To Do, from uprooting stelae to becoming legends.  The weird settings are all echoed in the rules.  The Possibilities are more than just the currency of the game, they're the currency of the <i>setting</i>.  The Miracles subsystem, which was driven by the the power of the community of the faithful, is like HeroQuest before its time.  The cards reward creativity in encounters.  And I thought the no-second-transformation-for-Ords-rule was full of drama and tragedy.<br/><br/>The fundamental problem with TORG and me is that it's tough to do it justice.  It's just like There's Too Much Stuff.  You can wall yourself off in a corner cosm somewhere and break people in slowly, but then it seems like you're denying the balls-out wacky goodness of the game.<br/><br/>So my awesomification for TORG is that it has to teach itself better. I think the rules for the various reality hacks you can do (reality bubbles, reconnection, contradictions, etc) need to be explained on a sheet similar to <a href="http://fab.wishray.com/pdf/fab-usrd-0101b.pdf" rel="nofollow">JasonP's Fabricated sheet.</a>  Same for every one of those tricksy power subsystems.  And I think that agendas ought to be explicitly outlined for every level of power -- so you start out defending people against the invaders, and then you start troubleshooting big plots, and then you really start taking the war to them with Glory and the like.                        </div>

                            What John said. There's a metric TON of awesome in there already - it's just spread out, poorly organized, and inconsistent. I think my biggest frustrations with the game were always (1) there were special case rules for everything, often fairly crunchy and (2) So Much Setting, and you really USED it. The prototypic adventures would involve characters from multiple cosms and usually a fair amount of globe-trotting, and it was actually worthwhile and relevant to keep a weather eye on the Big Picture Plot NPCs at most times.<br/><br/>I'd think that rationalizing/simplifying the mechanics and providing some way of breaking all the complexity down into chunks would be a good way to go. Maybe something along the lines of the Lore Sheet concept from <i>Weapons of the Gods</i> that would let a group pick and choose which elements of system, situation, and setting they wanted to make relevant to their characters would help?<br/><br/>This game needs Flags and Relationships like crazy.                        </div>

                            BSG was awesomofied for me mostly via the stronger emphasis on character relationships.<br/><br/>Off-topic: what was up with last episode? Lame.<br/><br/>Anyway, TORG as a setting doesn't introduce quick and easy "how I need to work with you but sometimes there's tension between us" components, at least not that I remember.<br/><br/>What might be cool is having some way that interaction between characters from different realities relates to how the realities themselves affect the characters. Like if my core guy hangs out with a magic setting guy, and we get all bondy, I lose a few core points and gain some magic points, and that might be good or bad, depending. Another way to explain it, maybe, is to say that relationship choices influence the setting itself. I think TORG has potential for that.<br/><br/>Is that a vague enough answer?                        </div>

                            Ooh, oooh, just thought of this one: <b>player-defined cosms. </b><br/><br/>So in lieu of the hardcoded cosms, every player gets to define their character's home cosm and has narrative rights over undecided bits of it.  That way, players know their native land better than anyone, everyone gets to flex their setting muscles, and you can satisfy players' wildest character creation dreams.  They could even make a pirate cosm and correct TORG's notorious pirate / ninja imbalance.<br/><br/>Also, maybe you'd keep a small set of vanilla cosms for the casual players who didn't want to engage that work fully.                        </div>

                            TORG is about these dudes from various dimensions -- the Gaunt Man, that Pharaoh dude from the Nile Empire, etc -- invading earth and trying to eat up its possiblity energy in order to ascend, apotheotically, as the Torg (God, essentially) of the multiverse, right?<br/><br/>So on one level a competitive game that's all about *being these guys* seems like a way to ramp up the awesome.<br/><br/>Setting something on that power level aside, though, I think johnzo's onto something.                        </div>

Matt!  Matt, what you're saying here is that Torg should be played as a Cold City game, right?  With the 'personal agenda' and 'national agenda' bits, only here it's personal loyalties vs. cosm loyalties.  Personal loyalties would tend to pull the characters together, but the demands of each one's native cosm should be what pulls them apart (at times), that sort of thing...                        </div>

                            That's kinda interesting.  In TORG, it seemed that the bad guys were all really organized by their empires, and that the good guys were these loose guerilla fighters that somehow stumbled into each other and joined to fight evil at any costs.<br/><br/>What if there were guilds or organizations of Good Guys as well? What if their agendas crossed, and came into conflict?<br/><br/>Maybe there are some groups who want to stop the bad guys and return Earth to its natural state at any cost.<br/><br/>Maybe there's another guild that will do any underhand dirty thing possible to make sure the Guant Man is dead and Orrorsh is not only subverted, but annihilated.<br/><br/>Maybe there's a third group that wants to overthrow the High Lords, but keep Core Earth as it us, as a gateway to many realms (so that other heroes can be found, gathered and use to fight other Cosms easier).<br/><br/>And the above three sometimes find themselves in conflict? Could be a little West Wing action, or down to "We must get the Item before the Anti-Orrorsh League does because they're just going to shove it in a bomb and detonate it, and WE could use it for The Better" etc.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Also, for me the Living Land was a little weak. Lizardman, dinosaurs and flying starfish, and jungle. I dug the "Land Below", which took the above and mixed them with Pulp. But if I were to Awesome-o-fy it, I'd probably put some Zerg-like action in the Living Land. Have the High Lord not just a Lizardman, but some sort of Overmind creature which controls or guides the creatures in its realm.

The Victorians of Orrorsh could serve nicely in this regard.  In the near view, they're allies, but in the long view, they're enemies.<br/><br/>(TORG 101: the Victorians were Orrorsh-ite British redcoats who followed the Gaunt Man to Earth, intending to battle him here because It's The Right Thing To Do -- but each of the Victorians brought along a little bit more of the Orrorsh reality, so they unwittingly reinforced the Gaunt Man's invasion.  It's a total colonial critique; they're here to help us, but they're really hosing us over.)<br/><br/>It could be a nice messy adventure for PCs to try to sabotage efforts to reinforce the Earth Victorians with new Orrosh Victorians.  Especially if a colony of Earth Victorians hangs in the balance...
<blockquote>Also, for me the Living Land was a little weak</blockquote>
I do love me some flying starfish, and I dug the tension of the Getting Lost rules.<br/><br/>(TORG 101: In the Living Land, the dinosaur cosm, it's terribly difficult to actually go to the place that you intend to go unless you can hack reality -- the landscape is completely crammed with undifferentiated mist and jungle.  Published adventures tended to gloss over this idea.)<br/><br/>There's a nice implication in there that once you run out of reality-hacking Possibilities, you're stuck in there ... forever.  It's a fine fate for a player character, especially since they can reappear later, wild-eyed and bearded.                        </div>

                            A way of rolling up your own cosms (like Shadows in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amber </span>or Chancels in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nobilis</span>) would be cool, especially if the system involved less fiddly balancing of advantages and disadvantages and more setting of Flags.  If you combine this idea with the "Cold City" idea earlier in the thread, you could have a lot of dramatic fun by creating <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consistent, cool, honorable </span>cosms for your characters to be from -- that nontheless have completely incompatible agendas. <br/><br/>I'm trying to think of any all-new cosms representing essential genres that were underappreciated in the original Torg.  I think, at a minimum, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land o' Wuxia</span> should be included.  Ideally, the rules would be flexible enough that one could easily import, say, Marr'd into the game to be a cosm.                        </div>

                            I found a PBP TORG game one time. I didnt end up participating too much besides making my "Cosm" as it was more intended a stratgegy level play as  High Lord sort of game. I still have the files for the Cosm of Dust sitting around here somewhere. I am liking a lot of what is going on, and you could easily sit down with a few friends,. make some Cosms, set the reality levels, gen some flavor and do Torg your style.                        </div>

                            Andy,<br/>You could matrix that out real easy<br/>Run the 3 Axis at the top<br/>Run the Levels down the side<br/>Put the effects (tech levels like) in the middle<br/>Similar to the way the original books laid it out<br/>but it would make it simple to look at, and then you could do the pick and chose the axiom levels for your cosm                        </div>

                            I've never even heard of TORG, other than on here, but i've always felt you could get some interesting mileage out of a crossworlds game where your character was slowly changed to match the alien world they were in.<br/><br/>Like, if each alternate World is defined by a SHOCK-type grid spackled with (the range of possible) character Features, then the multiverse is defined by a "stack" of those grids, the closer the more elements in common. And then you build your character sheet around your world's grid - say, circling those Features that belong to or inform your character. (In effect, you could make the world from the character more easily, in all likelyhood, by adding elements as they come up in play!)<br/><br/>So, you could be "influenced by the alien world" by taking an alien Feature to put on your character's sheet everytime you leave an alien world you've been visiting (and/or every session that ends with you still stuck away from home). Although, i would imagine you would want to make sure that the change isn't quite so fast, to keep the characters' world identities distinct. (Make it a choice? Spend a resource to resist the changes?)<br/><br/>Anyway, my crazy crossworlds notion!                        </div>
