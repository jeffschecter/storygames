In a general way, a "whodunit" approach can be done with a little bit of Dynamic Illusionism(TM).  Basically: Present multiple suspects, each with a motive (perhaps initially known, perhaps not), and multiple clues (some of which are red herrings).  You <i>don't</i> need to decide beforehand which ones are red herrings and which aren't.  As players move through the game examining suspects and clues, you can decide on the fly whether the current one is actually connected to the crime or merely circumstantial/coincidental.  If circumstantial, produce an explanation of the coincidence or an "airtight alibi".  If connected, produce a corroborating testimony or another clue proving that this suspect (unlike the others) also had the means and opportunity to commit the crime.  If you get pressed for time and need to wrap it up, you can produce an eyewitness or a "smoking gun" clue that proves all three (motive, means and opportunity) at once.  Just make sure that smoking gun comes as the result of a Player Move.<br/><br/>I'm aware that this approach isn't 100% free of railroading, it simply breaks the railroad up into much smaller pieces.<br/><br/>We can go further.  If you trust your players and your dice mojo, it's certainly possible to let their Skill Rolls or Attribute Rolls determine whether the current subject of investigation (clue or suspect) is actually connected or merely circumstantial.  If so, you might wanna make the first few clues a little difficult to gather, just to stave off the possibility of the crime being solved "too quickly".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433278/#Comment_433278" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-02T10:04:36+00:00" title="June  2, 2014 10:04AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2014 10:05AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you explain how exactly it tends to turn into railroading? (I'll also say that the way GUMSHOE explains its game does tend towards a railroady style, but you can use GUMSHOE other ways.)<br/><br/>I would focus on preparing a mystery session as a situation: don't give the characters one particular way to solve the mystery, and focus on figuring out the "ballistics" of the mystery. You know how in CSI or other crime shows they'll do bullet ballistics and other stuff? They're looking at the effects of a gunshot and then tracing it backwards to figure out what happened.<br/><br/>Mystery RPGs are the same way. As the GM, you create the crime, in the past. Then, you figure out what its consequences are. By paying attention to and analyzing the consequences, the players can trace them backwards to figure out what happened. (Also realize that there's usually massive amounts of possible consequences that the players can trace.)<br/><br/>Mix it up with ongoing events: the criminal hasn't stopped, after all. The players then have decisions to make, and can try to steer events in particular directions.<br/><br/>Incidentally, this approach jives really well with Powered by the Apocalypse games, most particularly Monster of the Week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433279/#Comment_433279" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-02T10:12:36+00:00" title="June  2, 2014 10:12AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is always a challenge, and there have been a number of really interesting conversations about this in the past on this forum. I can't find the links at the moment, but I'm sure someone will come along any minute now and post them.<br/><br/>Do you want solving the mystery to be the focal aspect of the game, like an old-fashioned novel of detective fiction? Or are you happy with a game that's more like a "modern" mystery story: there's some thing mysterious and maybe someone was murdered and no one know why, but really we care about the psychological action and the relationship drama?<br/><br/>In the latter case, lots of games have strong tools for building a relationship map and then creating drama from that standpoint. <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> comes to mind: the key here is to realize that what's really interesting is not the crawling-around-looking-for-clues, but rather figuring how to deal with the problem. Essentially the idea is to give away clues about the mystery as easily as possible - don't hold back, don't make that a challenge. The characters in the stories always find the clues, after all; the interesting part is in how they decide to deal with them once they've figured them out.<br/><br/>Make a dynamic situation instead of a static one, so that your various NPCs have motives and goals and will take action even if the players never solve the mystery - solving the mystery is just something that will give the PCs a major advantage in dealing with them, but the game will be fun and exciting even if they don't.<br/><br/>These two techniques, together or separately, are lots of fun and allow you to play out a mystery in a slightly different way without railroading.<br/><br/>If you're looking for specific games that deal with this in clever and unusual ways, I'd recommend you to take a look at <b>A Taste for Murder</b> as well as a recent thread here, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19441/does-my-two-page-game-make-any-sense#" rel="nofollow">does my two page game make any sense?</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433280/#Comment_433280" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-02T10:18:36+00:00" title="June  2, 2014 10:18AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a Dragon Magazine article this past December about running mysteries in D&amp;D, and the advice there applies to lots of games.

Are you worried that players somehow won't get the "correct" solution to the mystery? Or are you concerned that player abilities (of interpretation, understanding, and perception) will trump character abilities? Or something else?<br/><br/>Usually, when this concern is raised it's because someone has had it happen that failing to get the clues means that players get stuck and play bogs down. One solution to this is put the characters in a position where, regardless of whether they've solved the mystery and totally understand what's going on, they have to take action, and it is in taking action that the adventure really happens. The PCs may be foolish or mistaken, but the game still happens.<br/><br/>Another solution is to have mysteries (or puzzles, codes, and related enigmas) ancillary to the main action. We play detectives in a police procedural, and we investigate a locked-room murder that we just can't figure out. It doesn't matter, though: we have other cases to worry about, family matters to consider, nagging bosses on our back, and so our failure to solve the crime is just part of the overall background that sets the stage for whatever the game turns out to really be about, which could be about how our failures weigh on us.<br/><br/>But before you can devise a solution, you have to figure out what bothers you about the way you've run mysteries in the past. What's wrong with coming up with a mystery or criminal scenario, presenting information about it, and responding to player inquiries with more information until they've heard enough and come up with a course of action?

If you're too obvious, then there's no challenge, and it's no fun for the players to assemble a puzzle that was basically handed to them.  If you're too subtle or secretive, then the players quickly run out of logical inferences and wind up doing something else less fun (like "try random stuff", "guess what the GM is thinking", or "wait around for more clues").<br/><br/>I don't know of any RPG system out there that solves these problems.<br/><br/>I do have some GM advice which helps a lot for my game Delve, but as with many of the options already mentioned, Delve is not a "solve the mystery or lose" kind of game.  There's other stuff going on besides mystery-solving -- whenever the players get stumped by a puzzle piece, they probably also have danger bearing down on them, or other opportunities they want to pursue.<br/><br/><b>The relevant GM advice is basically this:</b><br/>- determine limits before hand, of what the players can't simply be given<br/>- within those limits, act as collaborator, trying to help them solve things<br/>- - remind them of good ideas they've had<br/>- - when they get stuck, summarize what they can take away, and encourage them to move on<br/>- - keep an eye out for crappy challenges, and if they come up and the players get stuck for more than a few seconds, go ahead and solve them yourself ("crappy" depends on your group's taste, but this often includes "look under every pebble" and "remember something which the characters would obviously remember")<br/>- if the players begin something you know is a dead end, don't play through it -- just get clear on what they're going to do, say, "Okay, you do that, and it doesn't work," and then summarize the results<br/>- make everything as interactive as possible -- encourage and enable the players to run experiments and test theories<br/>- make everything as connected as possible -- even if you hadn't planned a relationship between a given puzzle piece and a given NPC, once the players start looking for one, invent one if at all possible<br/><br/>For Delve, <b>making things testable</b> goes a long way, because forming and testing hypotheses is one of the core activities of actual puzzle-solving, as opposed to mystery fiction.  <b>The way I've made things testable is through metaphysics</b> -- the puzzles are magical, magic has a secret logic and language, the players have finite/costly tools which can be used to return information about puzzle-pieces and/or attempt magical effects in order to test hypotheses.  For example, "I think this is the rune for 'cold' and I think this position indicates 'this object', so I'm going to spend some Alodite to etch and activate this rune in this position on this club, and I'll see if the club freezes.

(Also realize that there's usually massive amounts of possible consequences that the players can trace.)<br/></blockquote>\nThese two things fit together, and formulate a great piece of GMing advice:<br/><br/>You might have thought of a couple of clues here and there which would allow someone to deduce the mystery. However, there are bound to be all kinds of clues you haven't thought of yet.<br/><br/>When the players spend time investigating something, go ahead and invent some clues if it's even remotely plausible. Of course, the more tangential their search is to the actual event, the less relevant the clues will be, but try to come up with something anyway.<br/><br/>For example: you have a mystery where someone snuck into a house a killed an old lady. You haven't established exactly how they got in, because you know the killer is well familiar with the layout of the house and wouldn't have found it difficult. <br/><br/>The players spend a lot of time looking around in the garden, poking at things. You don't have anything planned for the garden, so you make up some detail: they find the killer's footprints in the flowerbeds. Well, now we know how the killer got into the house!<br/><br/>You also know that the old lady was writing her last will and testament, and that the will is hidden in a chest in the basement. The players decide to look through the ashes of her fireplace for some reason. What? Why are they doing that? There's nothing there.<br/><br/>Instead, you think about it for a second: would there be any possible traces in a fireplace linked to what's going on? Sure! She's an old lady, and indecisive. Maybe she wrote several drafts of her will before settling on a final version, and burned the scratch copies. So the characters find some scraps of her earlier drafts in the ashes. <br/><br/>This works really well: don't limit yourself to the clues you've developed beforehand, just seed the explored environment with whatever plausible clues you or the players can think of. (It's quite likely, after all, that it was a player who came up with the idea of an earlier draft, and maybe that's why they were looking in the ashes in the first place.)<br/><br/>As an alternative, you could include a randomizer for yourself, something like this: <br/><br/>When the players investigate something which could potentially hold a clue, but you haven't thought of one yet, roll 1d6. <br/><br/>1: There's nothing here to be found.<br/>2: There is a misleading clue; a red herring.<br/>3-4: There is a vague, unclear clue of some sort - the characters can't get any specifics from it (e.g. they find a couple of footprints but can't figure out where they lead to)<br/>5-6: There is a clear clue which gives the players some pretty strong indications about what happened.<br/><br/>Of course, the difference between 3-4 and 5-6 could be based on a character's skill roll, instead, if it's that kind of game. Or on player cleverness, if it's a different kind of game. And so on.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433297/#Comment_433297" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-02T13:58:47+00:00" title="June  2, 2014  1:58PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I'm impressed by the amount of feedback in such a short time <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>What I have in mind is a Veronica Mars style teenage detective drama with also humor (and no, I didn't get hold of Bubblegumshoe yet...).<br/><br/>I wanted to get away from a step-by-step riddle-solving "competition". It should be more of an open ended exploration that gives the players an opportunity to head in directions the GM hadn't in mind yet.<br/>So, bringing in AW-style mechanics would be nice. <br/><br/>I was thinking about a detective style investigation of a *past* event. But of course, bringing in a criminal investigation with current events (i.e. murder threatens SCs) is nice.<br/><br/>Asif: I like the open-ended suspects. It's kind of watering down the railroading.<br/>CarpeGuitarrem: Wasn't aware Monster of the Week is based on AW-engine. This could be interesting.<br/>Paul_T: It's more detective than psycho/drama.<br/>Paul/Adam_Dray: I'll look at it, thanks.<br/>Bill_White: As a GM, I want things to go in different directions, not a pre-determined path. I enjoy it more as a GM to go in unexpected directions.<br/>Wilhelm/Rickard: Solving the mystery is important. Not just the thrill. Also, didn't have Ctulhu-horror in mind.<br/>Rickard: I had already checked out Murder of Mr Crow before, thanks.<br/>Dave_Berg: Eventually, imo the players should come up with the solution one way or the other. The way should be the fun. I really like your GM advice. Need to check Delve.
