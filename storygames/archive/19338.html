The participants themselves have built a schedule consisting of more than 15 panels, workshops  and round tables, as well as several game sessions to playtest developing games.<br/><br/>For this second edition we once again are preparing a schedule composed of not only discussion spaces, like panels and roundtables, but also activities to get our hands dirty, such as workshops, focus groups to discuss practical and specific design issues, and especially, a lot of playtests. Towards greater variety and depth in playtests, workshops and discussions at this year's Laborat\xf3rio de jogos will happen in three days, with over 30 hours of collective creation and development of narrative games !<br/><br/>If you understand a bit of Portuguese you can follow the preparations for the event through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/labjogos" rel="nofollow">event page on facebook</a>, and eventually, the video records we try to do from the event <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
