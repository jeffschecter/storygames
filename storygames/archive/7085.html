The game is starting to feel very, very solid. I want to play some long term games with it to see if I'm correct in that assumption, and have someone else GM it for me a few times. But short term play... it is proving that it rocks.<br/><br/>The playtest document is <a href="http://joepub.fileave.com/Perfectv2.4.pdf" rel="nofollow">right here</a>. I've also got a <a href="http://joepub.fileave.com/Perfectsheetv2.4.pdf" rel="nofollow">character sheet</a> and <a href="http://joepub.fileave.com/Perfectflowchart.pdf" rel="nofollow">scene flowchart</a>.<br/><br/>I'd love feedback, critique, questions and especially offers to playtest. I'm confident that Perfect is "almost there", and I want some help in getting it that last inch.<br/>As this is a playtest document, the text itself does not need editing. It's riddled with unclear statements and mistakes I'm sure, but I'm going to re-write from ground up and get someone to edit the actual final text. Rest assured.<br/><br/>Cheers, all!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157628/#Comment_157628" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-20T17:14:56+00:00" title="July 20, 2008  5:14PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I've got Perfect v.1 and I looked over an older version of the playtest documents for v.2 and I keep wanting to break it out.

In a world where passion is essentially against the law... what do you fight to care about, and how long do you fight? Any man can say something witty and kiss a girl. Not every man can say something witty and kiss a girl while inspectors clad in black chase through the shadows looking for him, intent on stealing him away to an unmarked room in a unmarked building, where ravenous rats skitter about and the sounds of other brainwashing sessions echo through the walls. This society is perfect. Except for you.<br/><br/>What matters, in a world where nothing is allowed to?<br/><br/><b>Brian</b>, Perfect works splendidly with 2 players. I don't personally recommend ever playing the game with more than 4 players, as the game is strictly focused on individual character spotlight time. With one player, you eliminate the opportunity for collaborative crimes, and thus make the game harder for the single player... but I think that the game is still highly playable. I'd recommend in a two person game have both people GMing for each other in alternation, otherwise it would be a VERY VERY intense and draining experience for all involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157635/#Comment_157635" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-20T18:07:44+00:00" title="July 20, 2008  6:07PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Perfect!

Some of my write-ups are spoiler-y and maybe best read after watching the movie if you're concerned about it:<br><br><b>Vera Drake</b>: Listed first because it captures so holistically what Perfect is about. It's got a quietly passionate woman who feels that society stifles her purpose in life. She's a criminal, but a human first. She forms contacts, and the harsh society tears them down in an attempt to get to her. She is Discovered, and then she is Conditioned. This is a somber, drawn-out and somewhat heart-rending movie... but Vera Drake follows a Perfect storyline to a t.<br><br/><b>V For Vendetta</b>: This movie shows how to link crime cycles (V's terrorist strikes and teachings would all be separate crime cycles), how to do collaborative crimes, and what the restrict-access-to-a-Contact Consequences look like (when Natalie Portman gets imprisoned in the prisoner's dilemma situation). A great movie if you want to see what a story arc might look like.<br/><br/><b>A Clockwork Orange</b>: Conditionings. This movie shows you how to run a bizarre, crazy conditioning. The psychiatrist's demonstration to a live audience of Alex's transformation afterwards is a great example of a Reflection if the player loses on a Conditioning test.<br/><br/><b>Pride and Prejudice</b>: This movie isn't about crime, and I can't pick any crime cycles out of its story. What it is great for is reflecting the half of perfect that Clockwork Orange and V both miss: the romanticism, the strained social contacts, the quiet personal struggles, the downplayed crimes.<br/><br/><b>Dexter</b>: Are we allowed to count TV shows? If so, Dexter. Dexter is a brilliant show about a serial killer who hunts down the corrupt and evil (including other serial killers). It's about a man who breaks the law, but who channels his crimes towards upholding justice. Dexter is great in so many ways: It shows you how to link crime cycles, how to bring Contacts into diverse scenarios, how to tie motivations into crimes... Ah! So good.<br/><br/><b>Equilibrium</b>: Equilibrium is like 1984's cool older brother: it has a car, it can buy cigarettes, it's a flashy dresser, it knows kung fu... it's not so articulate and probably isn't college bound, but all the ladies want to sleep with it anyways. Equilibrium has people learning to feel emotions again, risking their lives to save puppies, quoting Keats in abandoned courtyards and people getting taken down by ominous-looking, black-clad enforcers.

Okay, so an Intolerance is something that people <b>don't</b> narrate into normal scenes. "I cannot tolerate seeing the elderly abused", for example. At the start of a Crime Cycle, the player can call for an Intolerance scene, or the GM can. The differences are:<br/>*The GM frames the scene (oh my!)<br/>*The Tension Level is 20 for this scene.<br/>*Discovery is instead called Tolerance, and the test is to determine whether or not you can hold back from committing a publicly obvious crime. All Aspects that affected Discovery get to work just the same in Tolerance.<br/>*If Tolerance test is passed, move on to Payout and Reflection!<br/>*If Tolerance test is failed, narrate a crime! Narrate GETTING CAUGHT as part of the crime. Then, move on to Conditioning.<br/><br/>You don't get a free Aspect for doing an Intolerance anymore.<br/><br/>The most major change is removing Calm/Interrogation. In practice, the two separate testing tracks (Calm/Interrogation, Discovery/Conditioning) didn't work as fluidly as I would have liked. There were a lot of anticlimactic scenes where you had a brilliant and heart-rending Conditioning and then backtracked to see if the next day you lost your cool in the office, and then you get interrogated by people. The concept and that idea of how un-connected justice systems were... fantastic. The actual in practice effects? Didn't work. Often, we'd skip a test and I just wouldn't say anything.<br/><br/>Consequences are meant to replace the effects that Calm/Interrogation had, and give the GM a similar "do I hurt them with mechanics or narrations?" decision to make.<br/><br/>Freedoms.... Now, breaking one doesn't give a Freedom-specific mechanical effect. Instead, breaking any Freedom you have at any point in your Crime Cycle gives the GM 2 Opposition Points. Doing it again will give him another 2 points. Other than that, they're generally the same. I need to find more good ones. Any suggestions?<br/><br/>Contacts and Secret Societies now exist, because it was silly that they didn't before. They replaced Trusts, because Trusts turned out to be a touch unwieldy for their purpose in play.<br/><br/>You now have exactly 4 Aspects. This is because the "spend a point to create an Aspect" thing was confusing for some.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158353/#Comment_158353" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T08:13:57+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  8:13AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IIRC (I'm at work, don't have the v.1 book with me) in old Intolerance scences the player didn't get to roll a d6.

It's like England, but without the research. For the longest time, Cadence was ruled by a series of slovenly, drunken rulers. They would show up to parliament and call down all of the members. They would pass laws that were as nonsensical as they were impossible to enforce. When a particularly bad ruler died, the only person left to take the throne was his young daughter Abigail. Abigail was meek and doubtful and clearly the victim of significant abuse. When she showed up to parliament, she sullenly said nothing. And everyone loved it! Finally, they could do their jobs! Eventually, Abigail stopped talking all together. She walked around silently, trapped in her insecurities. And everything ran more smoothly for it. People began to imitate this behavior, and preach of the power of silence. She bound her hands in a single glove when she left the house, and refused to touch anything. People were crazy for her. And then she started dying.<br/><br/>Two men visited her in her chambers, and emerged with triumphant smiles. "She spoke to us! She broke her vow of silence to give us her first and only command: Make everyone like me, and never allow this to change." The phrase was vague, and she refused to clarify it (in fact, she refused to acknowledge ever having said it). But these men, and others, enforced it. Now, Cadence runs in memory of Abigail. It's laws have been dramatically and completely re-envisioned to enforce her guiding virtues. There will be no displays of love. There will be no words spoken where silence would serve better. There will be no colour where it is not necessary. Indeed, coloured clothing has been banned in favour of grey - the only colour you wear is your government-issued, colour-coded-by-social-status waistcoat. You carry your papers everywhere, in this Victorian dystopia.<br/><br/>And it works. It works perfectly. This society is perfect - except for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
