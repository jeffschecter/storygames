We used the shared editing mode to write up our comments, but it soon evolved into a sort of near-real-time forum, where we were each commenting (keyed to an individual color) back and forth.  By the time we were done we'd made 3500 individual edits to the document.  It was a very efficient and productive tool and allowed us to return our results quite quickly.<br/><br/>In contrast, during the early stages of Fiasco development I invited a number of people to review the evolving draft, posted as an editable Google Doc.  I flagged stuff I was concerned about and encouraged people to add comments to the text.  This was a failure - no one really made substantial use of the Web-based document at all.  I got good feedback, but it was primarily via email, via forum, or in person.  <br/><br/>So - same tool, different goals, radically different results.  I thought that was interesting, and wondered what your experience with collaborative tools was.  What tools have you used, how did they work out, and what emerged as best practice for you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201742/#Comment_201742" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T05:34:45+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  5:34AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently using Google Documents to let people edit and comment on A Taste For Murder.

When someone said "Comment on", I either thought that meant "Email me comments" or "Leave comments in the text". The second always seemed a bit rude, because it meant disturbing someone else's text.<br/><br/>The first time I understood the Comments feature was using that Little Game Chef document. Then when I saw your comments, I realised it must be a special feature. (Even then, at first I tried to replicate it with highlighting).<br/><br/>So, when I ask people to comment on A Taste For Murder, I specifically tell them about the comments feature.<br/><br/>One slightly annoying thing about sharing A Taste For Murder is that people do change the text. So, for example, I was laying it out yesterday, and found a heading called "Structure of Play". And I thought: that's strange, I'd never call anything "Structure of Play". Eventually, I realised someone else must have added that in.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201753/#Comment_201753" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T06:36:05+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  6:36AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We used Google docs for editing the Knutepunkt book.

This has impacted everything from our Categorization scheme to article naming to InfoBox design to talk page habits (indentation to maintain threads, and signing).<br/><br/>* Only edit an article to fix a format problem or MAYBE to correct an obvious typo. Otherwise, we do all the "proofing" and "Q&amp;A" on the article's Talk page.<br/><br/>* Multiple navigational structures. We have Categories (and encourage heavy use of them), we have three different Game List pages (in design, then by title and sorted by number of stashes or sets needed to play, once off the in-design/testing page), and we use the Front Page (Main Page) to instruct new members on the navigation and its proper use.<br/><br/>The one thing we breakdown on more than I'd like to see is off-site hosting of game rules. On the one hand, I can see it being annoying to keep something in sync on two sites (personal and public), but I ALSO think it leads to people getting format-heavy rather than game-focused (Icehouse pyramid games don't "need" layout tricks to convey the rule, being board games mostly). And if that person drops their site, we've lost a game forever (barring the Wayback Machine).<br/><br/>Anyhow... I guess most of the above could be summarized as "have a vision and inform others of it," much as folks in here have said vis a vis the use of commenting and so-forth on Google Docs. Navigation help, style guides, separating sandbox and discussion from main content. Oh, and going up to a full CMS with established roles and authority (ex: Joomla) can make this structure and style control stuff more enforceable.<br/><br/>Hope this helps;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201776/#Comment_201776" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T08:52:54+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  8:52AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2009 8:53AM by Destriarch.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The primary difference that I can see between your successful project and your failed project (well, not failed project, but the one which didn't get the best usage out of Google Docs) is one of participation. In the case of Lil' Game Chef you had presumably agreed on the concept beforehand and were all basically collaborating on a mutual project that you were all equally enthused about. In the latter less successful case it sounds more like you had a personal project that you were personally enthused about and invited people to give you feedback on it. It's often difficult to involve other people in your own projects like that, especially when they have to sign up to a new forum to do so. Had it been posted here instead, I think the response might have been better. I would expect that the contrasts in experience were mostly due to this barrier to entry, unfamiliarity, or a feeling of not being so deeply involved in the project.<br/><br/>Short version: Google Docs is great for managing mutual projects, not so great for encouraging feedback.<br/><br/>At least that would be my analysis, but what do I know?<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201780/#Comment_201780" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T09:09:06+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  9:09AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Graham, that's exactly what I wanted to happen with Fiasco, but it didn't.</blockquote>\nI was reluctant to do what I'm now guessing you wanted.<br/>It's hard reading people's level of attachment, it can be difficult territory.<br/>I wasn't sure what you wanted, so like Graham, I just emailed you, and wrote notes on a printout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201782/#Comment_201782" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T09:12:33+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  9:12AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys, that's helpful and I tend to agree with you, Ash.

So far we've seen wikis and Google Docs mentioned, but there must be other interesting solutions out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201783/#Comment_201783" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-13T09:13:54+00:00" title="April 13, 2009  9:13AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan, Graham, I'm always glad to have any feedback, so don't feel slighted!

I mean, what other functionality do you need? Version control (to roll back, if necessary), comment or similar controls, publication and/or change control enforcement--if those don't handle 90% of what you do to "collaborate," then I'm sure there's a plugin that will do the rest.<br/><br/>Are you hoping someone will show you an app you didn't consider? I mean, there's few that have (for instance) whiteboarding tools, like NetMeeting and others (but I bet there's a plugin that does similar). Hmmm... I guess that's a good angle to ask you, Jason: how needful is realtime collaboration versus "when we can get to it" sharing and commenting?

For sake of completeness, I would also like to mention <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/" rel="nofollow">Gobby</a>, a multi-platform real-time collaborative document editor. It works on Win/Mac/Linux/etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nI have myself successfully used GoogleDocs, but what has recently caught my attention is <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://www.getdropbox.com" rel="nofollow">Dropbox</a>. Dropbox is initially meant as an online storage space, which transparently synchronizes data between all your different computers (at home, work, etc). It also features a simplified version control, as it saves the deltas of the files (what has changed between saves). But the interesting part is that you can also share some of your folders, and thus have a collaborative space. What this means is that you can use any application you want to create/modify any type of file, and the file synchronization and versioning will be automatically be done for you. So for instance you can use Word, OpenOffice, Lyx or whatever to edit your text files, Photoshop or Gimp to edit your graphics, etc. Dropbox is application agnostic, since it only works with the files themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for concurrent edition of the same file by several users, Dropbox will automatically add the user and date modification, and merging will have to be done manually by the users. So no chance of data loss, but this is not the solution for real time concurrent edition (however, I think one could combine Abiword or Gobby with Dropbox).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother strength of Dropbox is that it operates in Win/Mac/Linux environments, and is dead simple to install. So although rsync, subversion and git would probably be more powerful tools for collaboration, the ease of use of Dropbox makes it an excellent tool to work with non technological minded people. Also, you get 2GB for free, so it's not a big investment to get started.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must say that I have not yet run a collaborative project with Dropbox, but I'm about to start a medium rpg project with someone living in another country, so I'll soon get some factual experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202416/#Comment_202416" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-17T06:33:40+00:00" title="April 17, 2009  6:33AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since Dropbox does not handle at all (apart for the collision protection) the concurrent edits and the merges I don't see it as useful as a collaboration tool, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexS" title="AlexS"><img alt="AlexS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4284/as32px.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexS">AlexS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202482/#Comment_202482" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-17T12:45:55+00:00" title="April 17, 2009 12:45PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2009 12:47PM by AlexS.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Since Dropbox does not handle at all (apart for the collision protection) the concurrent edits and the merges I don't see it as useful as a collaboration tool, though.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI agree that if you want to work concurrently on the same file, the use of Dropbox alone won't be sufficient. However you can parcel out the project in different files and work in different files. Also, nothing prevents you from combining Dropbox with Abiword or Gobby, for instance.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the nifty things with Dropbox is that the versioning is also done for binary files, such as pictures, and not only with text data, would be the case with GoogleDocs for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
