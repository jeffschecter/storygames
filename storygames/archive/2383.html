                    I'm working on how to represent the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2355&amp;page=1#Item_25" rel="nofollow">moment of crisis</a> in which a person stops being who they thought they were, and becomes something different.  The more I look at my source material (teenagey type identity stories) the more I see that this is correlated with the support of <i>other characters</i>.  This is a distinct difference from (say) classic super-hero stories, in which the driving force for internal change is internal ... the character grappling in isolation with their own beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
So ... what I have already:  When players roll their dice, those dice go from their active pool into a dead pool which they cannot (directly) access.  In order to access those dice, they need to give them to someone else, by making an opinion about that player's character.  So if I say "Jose, you get too emotionally attached to these girls," then I can slide a die from my dead pool to Jose's player.  When he spends that (by living up to my description of him) then the die comes back to me.<br/>
<br/>
So the cycle is "Active Pool --(Roll)--&gt; Dead pool --(Opinion)--&gt; Another player --(Roll)--&gt; Active Pool."  That's the fundamental.<br/>
<br/>
But, actually, there's an additional little fillip:  dice don't get rolled directly from the active pool.  Three playtests ago, they were moved onto cards representing the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2145&amp;page=1#Item_60" rel="nofollow">details of the character's conflict</a>, and then rolled off of there when the conflict came up.  That gave a function to scenes that weren't <i>enacting</i> the conflict, but were narrating the import of the conflict and lending build-up.  I liked that a lot, but it meant that the story was all about the conflicts and not very much about the character.<br/>
<br/>
Two playtests ago, they could put dice on the details of the conflict <b>and</b> they could put dice on aspects of their character.  The thing is, very quickly, the aspects of the character totally took over.  It was always easier to narrate egotistically about yourself than to get your conflicts running.<br/>
<br/>
So, one playtest ago, I removed the self-aggrandizement mechanic, and to balance out I just sort of added in (for shits and giggles) the idea that you could <b>also</b> place a die as a "matching fund" on any opinion-die that someone had given you.  So if someone says "You're too emotionally attached to these girls" you can later do a "Did I choose her because she'd make a good assassin?  Or was it out of pity?" monologue and add your die to their die, making an opinion worth two dice when you spend them.  That worked out really nicely for making people look for reasons to live up to the things other people had said about them.<br/>
<br/>
So now ... in my <b>next</b> playtest, I'm thinking that the difference between those two is the difference between a person <b>before</b> their moment of crisis, and a person <b>after</b> it.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanically, what if risk of the moment of crisis is that you <b>lose</b> all of the attributes of your character that you started out the game with ... but the benefit (apart from getting all your Angst-dice back into the economy) is that you <b>gain</b> the ability to place matching dice on the opinions other people have given you?<br/>
<br/>
How do you think this would feel to people?  What sort of tactics does it imply?<br/>
<br/>
I think, for instance, that it implies that it is <i>risky</i> for two people to hit their crisis near or at the same point.  There is a limited pool of dead dice from the other players, and fighting over that scarce resource is likely to be nasty business for at least <i>one</i> player, and probably both.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what the other implications would be, though.  The idea is too new to me.                </div>

                            Yeah, there'd be a whole meta-game about timing your character's nervous breakdown, and it could get ugly (or interesting) if there's a big pool of dice at stake and two players racing to drive their guy over the edge first.  <br><br>The other implication I'm seeing right now is that it puts a lot of mechanical weight into those "opinion dice".  By giving them to another player, I'm not just giving them some extra dice they can use if they live up to my opinion of them, I'm also offering to rewrite their post-crisis character sheet. That's a lot of power to vest in the other players and GM, but it might take the character in new and exciting directions.                        </br></br></div>

                            Danny:  Oh, I hadn't even thought about the question of how pre-crisis offers of opinion carry over into an amplified post-crisis form.<br/>
<br/>
Now that's <i>interesting</i>, because there's all sorts of give and takes there about whether you want to <b>have</b> a crisis.<br/>
<br/>
Like, suppose you've only been handed opinions like "You're a trouble-maker" and "You'll never amount to anything" and the like ... and you don't want to be that person, but your Angst just keeps piling up.  You'd actually go out <i>fishing for</i> positive opinions from people who you think might give them to you.<br/>
<br/>
But they don't want to give you the opinions <b>yet</b>.  Why?  Because you're going to be hoarding those dice until you've got a nice safe stash to carry you through the crisis and into a comfortable new identity.  And when you hoard dice, those are dice they <i>do not get back</i> any time soon.<br/>
<br/>
By preference, they'd far rather that you just take the leap of faith, dive into your crisis, <b>and then</b> they'd be thrilled to hand you a ton of opinion dice from their dead pool, because you'll be matching them and spending them immediately, which is vastly to their advantage.<br/>
<br/>
But from your point of view, how can you tell this apart from the scenario where they're going to let you have your crisis, and then let you flap in the breeze, without any supporting opinion?  You can't!<br/>
<br/>
Heh.  That looks like it might have some fun potential.  I genuinely hadn't even thought of that side of things.  I was thinking purely in terms of what the crisis does to opinions offered post-crisis.                        </div>
