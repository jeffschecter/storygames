This reductionism reflects a culture that inflates aggression and competition while cultivating ignorance of other behavioral options. No narrative of any complexity can be built on or reduced to a single element. Conflict is one kind of behavior. There are others, equally important in any human life, such as relating, finding, losing, bearing, discovering, parting, changing."<br/><br/>I know some games address this within their systems, but not many. How could we better reflect such non-conflict changes in our games, not just as hooks, but as central theme?* Which games do this well already?<br/><br/><br/>*If you don't agree with the premise, take it to another thread.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204335/#Comment_204335" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T04:00:22+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  4:00AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some things which we call "Conflict" just mean there's some thing where the outcome is not given. The conflict sometimes is purely mechanical, to see whether one succeeds or not, rather than a conflict of interests between characters, or characters and the world. You could say it's a conflict between the character's wishes and luck, but that's life.<br/><br/>I think some uses of "Fate Points" are just this, specifically in games where you spend a fate point to describe and create some fact in the world. Also, I think that "Sharing" or "Relating", in real life, are only meaningful because the default is not sharing, or at least, we know of its possibility. So in a game, even if there are no conflicts, the conflict should exist in the background - but I can agree with Le Guin; as a spice to give the main course its meaning, rather than as the main course itself.<br/><br/>I think we also need to identify why we are so bent on conflict in our games if we want to see how to move past it. I think that different from stories written by an author, you can have several players who want something, something mutually exclusive, and that'd lead to a conflict. But would it be ok if it were only a meta-level conflict, one between the players, where the characters don't compete (whether Charles falls in love with Sarah or takes NASA on their trip to Pluto offer, but without there being a conflict between characters either way)? I don't see why not.<br/>Or because some people still look at the rpG part, where they want mechanics, and it's probably easier to have mechanics about conflicts, though quite possibly because we're used to that.<br/><br/>In other words - I think we're already there for some value, but Simon, please clarify, when you say "No conflict", is it only conflict inside the world, or also between players? And is a character desiring a better job and not getting it, would that be a 'conflict'? What do you mean when you say 'conflict'? That's something to know if we try to explore non-conflict approaches.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_204336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204336/#Comment_204336" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T04:07:02+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  4:07AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2009 4:18AM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have, amongst others, been an advocate for the idea that <i>conflict </i>is essential in building theme in role-playing games.

I am not saying we should remove conflict, merely that there are other forms of human interaction which might be interesting to address with system. For example, in Fear Itself, you often have flashback scenes perhaps to establish the foundation of a relationship between PCs, but these are purely roleplayed. It might be interesting to establish what kind of relationship to establish in system in this case, before the fact.<br/><br/>I'm not explictly saying that we should avoid conflict between players to establish what happens in these sorts of non-conflict situations; fighting over narration rights through randomness or resources can be enjoyable. But I don't for the purposes of this thread it will lead to any innovation. I don't exclude it, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204339/#Comment_204339" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T04:34:15+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  4:34AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm raising this as an option, where in my examples there's usually no conflict amongst the players, but there is the possibility of conflict between characters, but I think it may be the right kind?

If the only RP that occurs is specific kind of scenes, in specific situations, then you can also have the choices within them not have anything to do with conflict.<br/><br/>You can look at Bliss Stage, though often there is conflict between the pilots, or pilots and anchors, or anchors, it's usually a conflict born out of relating, sharing, a change of a relationship, losing, parting, or changing. Seems right up the alley to me. The "conflict" there is usually not the focus, at least as how I see it, but merely a road to the real issue, the relationships.<br/><br/>I'm going to mention a project I've worked on here (it's also mentioned in that thread), <a href="http://craniumrats.pbwiki.com/f/Juiced+Rider+Alpha+1.2.2.zip" rel="nofollow">Juiced Rider</a>.

So whilst conflict is bringing that difference out into the open and deciding who wins, the others are:<br/>- relating, finding out what, despite differences, we have in common<br/>- finding is going from a state without to a state with, it's an internal difference<br/>- losing is the opposite of finding (and also the opposite of winning)<br/>- bearing is putting up with the difference<br/>- discovering is uncovering a difference, or lack of it<br/>- parting is walking away from a difference, or lack of it<br/>- changing  can be about the underlying person or the relationships between them<br/><br/>Not that I'm pretending that this is a definitive list. YMM and will V.<br/><br/>But any of these can be resolved by conflict, in it's meaning as a resolution of differences. I want to go, you want me to stay (A), we part (B). That's a conflict. How do we move from A to B is the resolution. Conflict in games mostly looks at it from that angle, and then decides how we feel about it. It might be more interesting to say "we're going to part" and then play out what this means to us. In fact, that's the attitude that Koenig Hospital takes. You randomly decide what is going to be involved in the conflict and then the guy whose scene it is decides what is going to be decided, and then you play it out to see how everyone is affected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204351/#Comment_204351" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T05:09:04+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  5:09AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Jason, what does it mean, for you (and Fiasco), that it's outcome-oriented as opposed to conflict-oriented?

The game is divided into scenes and in each scene, you either choose to establish it or resolve it, and everybody else at the table does the part you don't choose.  "Resolve" means deciding wither the outcome is positive or negative for the character in the spotlight.  So it's very loose and requires cooperation and agreement.  Before, when it was conflict focused, you had to clearly articulate what you wanted no matter what, so that resolution could be about that exclusively.

Specifically I'm thinking about refreshes in Bliss Stage, Agon (though those are often filled with conflict), The Shadow of Yesterday, and the players' turn in Mouse Guard, but there are others.  Also, hitting and buying off Keys in TSOY (along with a bunch of other similar character development mechanics) is another way to mechanically support things happening that aren't necessarily about conflict.  Also, I think one could argue that fallout in Dogs in the Vineyard is somewhat related.  Fallout is like "So, the conflict happened, but this is what it actually means," so it gives you character developments that are independent of or perpendicular to the stakes and actions of the conflict.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I've been excited about structured freeform design (even in its Nordic larp-inspired forms, like Jeep, which isn't necessarily where my personal design interests lie) is that it frequently structures things such that any given scene basically works like "refresh" scene, in that conflict isn't necessarily the goal that you drive towards, so things are often more exploratory, with different players coming in with different intents for the scene and something unexpected happening as a result.  My early experiments, such as the <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> fanfic game, worked almost completely based on this kind of play, with a few other mechanics pointing players at specific themes and such.<br/><br/>P.S. I think part of the reason structured freeform tends to lean in this direction is that most freeform designs lack formal conflict resolution guidelines, so other kinds of resolution can come to predominate.  But you can still have a lot of non-conflict resolution in games that are not freeform, but more mechanically structured, you just might have to explicitly make spaces for them to occur in, because a lot of roleplayers (especially Forge-influenced ones honestly, less so "we're playing Shadowrun but only kinda using the rules" folks who have been used to ignoring the resolution system) tend to have play focus on places where the most mechanics are.  That said, Vincent's recent "follow the fiction" designs (Poison'd, etc.) are aimed at trying to get folks (even conflict-centric indie gamers) to ignore the formal mechanics more, which can lead to more non-conflict resolution, I think, because you can stab somebody and throw them overboard without there being a conflict, so play becomes more expressive.  Just my 2 cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204362/#Comment_204362" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T05:27:34+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  5:27AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Before, when it was conflict focused, you had to clearly articulate what you wanted no matter what, so that resolution could be about that exclusively.

And what's the interest in gaming terms?<br/><br/>I shall ramble, feel free to jump in anywhere.<br/><br/>Presumably if you don't want to think about it in terms of a conflict, it's not about leaving vs. not leaving. So it's about:<br/>- what leaving means to the people involved, or <br/>- what it means to the relationships - which is less personal and harder to roleplay but might show up on a character sheet as a changed relationship or a memory either as something positive or negative, or<br/>- the communities which one leaves and one joins, or<br/>- something else<br/><br/>Do you just decide that the leaving happens and then resolve what that means?<br/><br/>Do you resolve what would happen if you left and if you stayed and then chose between them, either on personal preference or some scoring system (random or otherwise)?<br/><br/>Do you have a Polaris style game in which you can leave, but only if ... ?<br/><br/>I find it easier to work on an example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204383/#Comment_204383" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T07:01:02+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  7:01AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Simon">Simon</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Conflict is one kind of behavior.

Like Tomas says.<br/>\n<br/>\nlike some pointed out there is a trend right now that focuses on accepting that the fiction is as much a part of the system (if not more) as the rules and mechanics are. And it is all about allowing it to form the outcome of further choices outside and inside the fiction. This is from the simple (are there paramedics available to storm in and rescue the character (R.Edwards about sorcerer) to the more involved:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my game Harde menn each character has three relationships that matter to him. They have no mechanical effect on gameplay (oh the horror). They do however have a great impact on the fiction generated in play, both as means to ramp up conflict, increase involvement and generally to put a more human face on characters that may easily be portrayed as soulless sociopaths. These relationships will change in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo by looking at conflict as more a crux that leads to consequences rather than an actual conflict the act of abandoning, leaving, loosing, discovering and what not are just as valid. By stepping out of the character (actor stance) and into the fiction (author stance) it is fully possible to use intention based resolution to look at waht happens.<br/>\n<u>Imagine using otherkind dice for this.</u><br/>\nInstead of calling it danger will call it consequence. 1-3 consequence does not come true, 4-6 consequence comes to pass.<br/>\nMy character is leaving his wife. We play the scene, it is heart rending. We roll the dice. I want them to part as friends, but the consequences are that their mutual friends becomes estranged, and there is still a small hope that things may work out. We roll.<br/>\nAnd let the dice and the fiction decide where we go from here.<br/>\n<br/>\nA guy called H\xe5ken called this the third narrative voice back at rollespill.net, and that term has stuck with me. it is all about intorducing an "impartial" element that contributes to the evolving fiction in a way we may not have predicted or mutually thought of.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a sorcerer game you might look at the carry over and interpet that according to the fiction. Did my guy leave his wife as friends, in fact he has three dice saying that he did so. But what do these dice mean, well that is up to the GM (the player of my wife).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we haven't even begun to look at what leaving before the conflict comes to a head says about my character, and the way the fiction goes from here.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all of these to work they have to rise organically from the fiction, and we must trust it to show us the way on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the poetry in roleplaying games. but I rambling. so i'll be leaving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204400/#Comment_204400" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-30T07:50:58+00:00" title="April 30, 2009  7:50AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2009 7:57AM by timfire.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>What is often missed, in these discussions, it's that "conflict" as a <i>RPG mechanic</i> and "conflict" as a literary term aren't the same thing.</blockquote>\nThis is totally true, I just wanted to emphasize the point.<br><br>In these types of discussions, I like to point out that in <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, the real "conflict"---in the literary sense---is the tension that individual characters/players feel between their individual Fates and the well-being of group, and how that tension strains the characters' relationships. <i>And that dramatic "conflict" is handled totally <b>non-mechanically</b></i>.

The PC in question is a mouse named Joseph and he wants his relationship with his cousin Ferdinand, an NPC, to be strengthened through surviving a trek through a snowstorm together.  That's his goal (stakes) for a Journey conflict.  The goal the GM assigns to the snowstorm is for the misery of the trek to make their relationship even worse and give Joseph the "Angry" Condition.  This places the GM in opposition to the player, even if the GM would rather their relationship get better or the player really wants their relationship to get worse.  Players take sides for particular goals in the fiction and advocate for them.  This doesn't require them to want to win or hose the other player, though, just provide some antagonism.<br/><br/>We're playing <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, so the snowstorm isn't actually a thing, mechanically.  The conflict is now between Joseph (a Dog) and his cousin Ferdinand (a no-good ex-Dog-turned-bandit).  The GM plays Ferdinand now, as a NPC, and the conflict starts as Just Talkin'.  This situation is even more directly confrontational, because the GM doesn't have the mediating element of playing an impersonal snowstorm raining misery on the characters, but instead things become very personal as the GM and player negotiate their way through the conflict as the two characters in question, again advocating strongly for each side, as required by the See and Raise mechanics.<br/><br/>We're playing a game like <i>Bliss Stage</i> or <i>Otherkind</i>, where there are multiple categories for players to put dice in and different traits they can draw on to get more dice (however, each trait drawn on adds a new category to put dice in, so it's not always better to draw on as many traits as possible).  In this kind of system, Joseph's player is essentially rolling <i>against himself</i>, a bit like playing solitaire.  The player picks which traits to use, rolls the dice, and then chooses how to place them in various categories.  The other players might have the power to alter the categories a bit (like when the GM treatens categories in <i>Bliss Stage</i>, making players put more dice there), but they don't really actively participate in providing mechanical antagonism (though they may provide some narrative antagonism).  If Joseph's player succeeds or fails, it's because of luck and that player's choices.<br/><br/>The fourth way is to not engage conflict mechanics at all.  One player plays Joseph, another plays Ferdinand, and maybe a couple others describe the events of the snowstorm.  And interesting things emerge from the interplay of those different players contributions, just as in the "freeplay" portions of heavily mechanical rpgs or all play in a freeform play style.  The only problem with approaching the situation this way is that, in most RPGs, the things that happen during freeplay have no mechanical effect on the stuff on the character sheet or any mechanical things that happen later in the game.  So there's this incentive -- if you want what happens to actually matter mechanically -- you have to engage the conflict mechanics and, in most cases, that means engaging in antagonism or a confrontation with other players at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204710/#Comment_204710" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T08:49:15+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  8:49AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So if we're going to take LeGuin's types of resolution seriously, I think we need to consider a couple of things:<br/><br/>- have interesting stuff happen in freeplay too, instead of just where the mechanics are<br/>- have the non-conflict stuff have mechanical significance (if there are mechanics)<br/>- have resolution mechanics that don't frame things as inter-player (or player-GM) conflicts<br/><br/>In some ways, I think this is kinda what Vincent has recently tried to suggest, having fictional elements ("having the higher ground") give you mechanical differences in play ("I get a +2 to attack and defend!").  The problem is that, in those cases, players are always incentivized to declare that they've seized the higher ground or have other fictional advantages, even when that doesn't make any sense for the fiction.  So there's this problem of letting the fiction impact the mechanics without having purely mechanical concerns negatively impact the fiction.  And I don't think we've solved that problem yet (and it should probably be a separate thread, anyway).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_204734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204734/#Comment_204734" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T09:51:50+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  9:51AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could it be that by regarding the way we play as our <i>method</i>, not as a product of <i>mechanics</i>, we may broaden our perception of how to make role-playing games, and thus enable us to design games that will ease the introduction and use of Le Guins types of resolution ... ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209171/#Comment_209171" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T18:11:57+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  6:11PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2009 8:47AM by misuba.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Awakening this thread long enough to express my shock that Emily Care Boss' <i><a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/sis.html" rel="nofollow">Sign In Stranger</a></i> didn't get a mention.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209185/#Comment_209185" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T19:32:20+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  7:32PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, misuba.

It's a automatic thing in most games I have observed "live" or not.  Players begin to add story elements that create conflicts, pleasing their sense of "story".  Forbidding them to do so is frustrating, unnatural and can cause frustration and rage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213827/#Comment_213827" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-22T06:59:17+00:00" title="June 22, 2009  6:59AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A foregone conclusion doesn't mean that there's no conflict.
