I was out of the room while a lot of the map was created, but sure enough, there was an archipelago drawn when I returned, consisting of islands shaped like classic schoolyard knobs.  Some wag had named this land "The Paedo Isles" and thus a grand adventure was born.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter creation left us with a motley assortment of adventurers:<br/>\n<br/>\nA magical healing Ponycorn called Yayy (With pannier mounted + 1 Healing ice-cream dispensers)<br/>\nPrincess Boris, the ninja were-gnome<br/>\nWaitrose, arch-demon of groceries (with a Trolley of +1 Dash)<br/>\nDurgen Splurgen, Nordic wolf-boy<br/>\nX-40: shoving robot - Playing the Bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point disaster truck, and Claire was summoned away from the table to collect a swine-flu addled relative from the other end of the country, but the rest of us decided to soldier on heartlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\nA location on the map was chosen, the oddly named "Duck Roll City" which had a picture of a duck with wheels next to it.  It was quickly decided that the big boss of Duck Roll City was Lord Turducken, who's specialities were Hack &amp; Slash and Sense.  Three level 3 character entering their first dungeon made him level 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonster creation was fruitful, and netted us a selection of critters with names I cannot possibly post on the internet because of their general gutter-mindedness, plus a level 7 magic "Blast" monster called a Trevor, a level 3 "Shoot" Miffed Duck and a level 1 "Hack" monster called "ARGH! FUCKING ANTS!!!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe players entered Duck Roll City and were immediately set upon by merchants selling cheap Hoi-sin and orange sauce.  After enquiring upon the freshness of the goods, Waitrose was told that they were frozen and imported from Ice-Land, home of his sworn enemies, the Mumms.  This kicked things off nicely, and a fight ensued which wrecked the market and left many baddies with unmentionable names dead or dying.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay continued, with many enemies succumbing to Waitrose's Blast and Boris' Sneak Attacks.  Even the harmless group of NPCs who just wanted a favour were mercilessly butchered for their stuff.  Eventually even Lord Turducken was laid low by the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlans were made to visit the next Labyrinth, but alas: the hour was late and it was time to go home.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, this game was a blast, but the learning-curve seemed a little steep.  To be fair, that's mainly because, (being exceptionally busy and lazy) I'd played this briefly about a year ago, and hadn't actually read the book until I started running the game.  If I'd taken the time to read the book properly ahead of time we'd have found things a lot easier.  Oh well, that's what I get for being lazy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224459/#Comment_224459" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T09:09:32+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  9:09AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa, this sounds off the wall crazy delicious. <br>Especially the +1 Healing ice cream, Mmmmmm.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224595/#Comment_224595" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T18:24:56+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  6:24PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2009 6:25PM by Eric.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://dontclickthis.whatingods.name/duckroll.jpg"/><br><br>It's the original Rickroll.
