The game was otherwise brilliant, but in the end we had a tricky situation. One of the players, the boatswain, managed to piss everyone else off. He drew pistols with one other and won. Other players started flooding in; but, within the fiction, they started flowing in one by one. The boatswain duelled with each one in turn, because the fiction dictated so; it couldn't be translated into a fight between a group and one man.<br/><br/>As GM, I may have complicated the situation by allowing instant resurrections by bargaining with a supernatural power (it was my third game and I didn't fully understand what it would do to the story), but the meat is this: the game started bogging down, because one duel followed another and every one of them involved a boatful of dice. The fictionally tense situation became a lengthy exercise in counting and throwing dice. <br/><br/>One on one, the conflict system is great. It's tense and meaty. But the situation above left an unpleasant taste in my mouth, and a craving for something speedier. I still want to play the game (a small campaign, even), and the session was one of the most powerful gaming sessions I've ever had, but I'm hesitant to call it Vincent's best design.<br/><br/>Did I miss something? Has anyone experienced the same?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386078/#Comment_386078" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T14:42:14+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  2:42PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was going on while all these duels were happening sequentially?<br/><br/>What fiction made them all duel and not just mob him?<br/><br/>How did they resolve it in the end?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386087/#Comment_386087" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T16:28:19+00:00" title="July 31, 2012  4:28PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you've got a group fighting a guy, try running it like a ship combat. Nominate a "captain" of the group. If the captain wants someone else to fight for them, they give them a die. Then, each member of the group chooses whether to fight (in which case they roll an <i>extra</i> die) or to bail (in which case they mark two Xs).<br/><br/>It works! And I've run this past Vincent and he said it was cool.<br/><br/>Poison'd is a flawed game, but it's wonderful. It is my favourite of Vincent's games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/halski" title="halski"><img alt="halski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/halski">halski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386116/#Comment_386116" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T23:35:03+00:00" title="July 31, 2012 11:35PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the other PCs were in different places. They started running there one at a time, and they couldn't - or wouldn't, I don't remember clearly - coordinate their attack. I didn't feel it was plausible to turn it into a ship combat-y fight, which I otherwise would've done. The boatswain had shot the first guy in a small cabin and the air was filled with gunpowder smoke. There was one other guy near them, and he ran in the small door. There wasn't much room for anything else. <br/><br/>I may have complicated the situation by allowing the boatswain to bargain for his life with the Devil, instantly. When I play it again, I definitely need to wait for the scene to end before anyone can bargain for his life.<br/><br/>It was otherwise a marvelous game. The flashbacks played out like they do in Reservoir Dogs, PCs endured insane duress, and the religious aspects of the game shined.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
