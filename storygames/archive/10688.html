Yes, I believe you paid $14 for a print copy of the aschan edition in 2007. (I handed out a few for about $10 in 2008, as I recall.)<br/><br/>While the game will seem be VERY familar to anyone familiar with the ashcan edition, several ruler changes make the game much better balanced and playable. The ashcan edition of the rules produced results that were increasingly lopsided -- either the Director tended to win, or the players did.<br/><br/>This version is also better edited, and thus actually significantly shorter than the ashcan. I think it's around 60% of the text that was in the ashcan. I find the text much more straightforward and helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237320/#Comment_237320" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-13T20:51:18+00:00" title="October 13, 2009  8:51PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the single sentences that end most sections.

They are symmetrical.<br/><br/>I've played some games where they get kind of tired. Like, "OOh, they don't  bleed! Creepy." Then, every scene involves some scissors or something. YAWN.

In fact, I also prefer it also, and prefer it for this game. Front loading outcomes isn't anywhere near as fun. <br/><br/>I like to think of it as a much more natural "flow" than the abrubt binary choice it may appear to be in the rules. We're talking, we're playing, stuff happens, and then all the sudden WAIT! Players give pause and say "ah, wait, let's roll for that." And, so they roll and THEN decide stuff by role-playing those outcomes out briefly. Clearly, whoever gave pause gets something they want for a character if they win, or something that probably still scrunches them up if they lose. But, all the while, we're playing, contributing stuff with each other, throwing ideas out there that happen pretty naturally "in the fiction."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred" title="watergoesred"><img alt="watergoesred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6681148/Account%20icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred">watergoesred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237577/#Comment_237577" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T17:08:12+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  5:08PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another rules question, this time about the example on page 28. <br/><br/>Why does Margaret's player set aside 3 dice (5,6,6)? <br/><br/>In the example, only one anxiety (Doesn't want to die alone: 1) is mentioned being triggered.

This might be in the text but I couldn't find it at the table.  There was a classic pod-people-esque scene where like 4 npcs who had become agents all turned on the nurse character, but I'm not 100% sure it was legal...<br/><br/>-What is the procedure on declaring the use of secrets/anxieties?  The game has a fair amount of strategy, and there was a bit of "well, are you using a secret?  Because that affects whether I'm using an anxiety."  Who declares first?  Or do we both declare in secret and then reveal?<br/><br/>-Is there an "end of turn" sequence right before the Zero hour?  It felt kind of weird to roll resistance vs. menace, have a cut scene, immediately roll resistance vs. menace again and then have epilogues.<br/><br/>-Who narrates the epilogues?<br/><br/>-How secret is the information about the conspiracy (what their goal is, their methods, the stuff the director writes down at the beginning of play?  I kept that from the players, but then when it came time to narrate cut-scenes, which are supposed to be collaborative, the players kept narrating in stuff that threw my plans massively for a loop, and I had to bargain them down (this actually produced a cool hybrid, as it turned out...).  How much control does the director have over the content of the conspiracy?  How does that affect the group free-form narration in the cut scenes?<br/><br/>-As director, I was terrified of being forced to take a big hit to control and thus sucking the tension out of the game.  Was this ever a problem in playtests, and is there a good way to deal with that if it arises?<br/><br/>-How exactly is scene framing supposed work?  It seemed like there were a couple of ways to interpret the instructions.  The first possibility was that ALL you use to frame the scene is the three details, plus whatever hints you have from the way the last scene ended.  Then as soon as the scene starts whoever talks first de facto fills in the rest through context.  This seemed to lead to people packing as much as possible into their details.  The way we ended up doing things was that the scene would have a basic concept (kind of like the scene agenda from PTA), and then the details would give time, place, context, etc, for that to happen.  For example, we had a scene where the nurse wanted to confront the doctor who gave her mother the mysterious "treatment."  Her detail: I've finally got him in the room with me at his hospital.  My detail:  The hospital is a mental institution.  The other players: And he's a patient.  Should the details just set a place and time, rather than a premise for the scene?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237974/#Comment_237974" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-17T12:29:49+00:00" title="October 17, 2009 12:29PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading through now.  Hoping to play at the next GoPlay Peoria...which is next Saturday BTW Matt...<br/><br/>Another scene framing question building on the above:  The order for details say clearly:  Player's detail, Director's detail, then other player's collective detail.  But then farther down on the page there's a cryptic reference to "Sometimes, the Director will start a scene instead."  Does this mean that sometimes the detail order is switched with the Director going first?  How is that decided / When does that happen?  Or does it just mean that sometimes the Director's detail will be the one that sends the scene into motion?  Or what?  If both the player and the Director have a direction they want to go to kick off the scene...how do you determine who's action "goes off" first?<br/><br/>Also, clearly, a scene will consist of more details than just the initial three and that those three are just the idea spring board.  But I'm not finding any additional guidance.  The example on page 16 clearly provides the player with a degree of directoral stance power, but I don't find any restrictions or Director veto on its use, is there any?  Also, are the other players permitted to continue to add details, or is the initial detail <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> their only official contribution outside of playing any of their characters that appear.  Or do they individually have the same directoral stance power in another player's scene with regards to playing their character in that scene?<br/><br/>Triggering Anxieties:  The rules indicate that player's MAY trigger anxieties and do not indicate that the Director has the option of triggering them for them.  Is that by design.  It seems reasonable to be that if Mr. Clark is high on the bridge but the player doesn't choose to trigger his fear of hieghts Anxiety that the Director should be able to do so...simpy on the grounds that's its kind of odd for a player to control when their characters are or aren't going to be anxious.  By the rules I don't see where this is permitted.<br/><br/>Page 22 "Too Much Stress" is a little unclear.  Earlier the order was established that Stress is first applied to Bonds and then to Qualities.  On page 22 it states that if any stress is received while a Quality is 0 the character is Replaced.  How does the presence of Bonds when that happens effect this?  It would seem in line with the game's design that you could use Bonds as a "shield" to absorb stress to avoid being replaced by keeping your character in contact with his bonds until one by one they're replaced.  But if that were the case then page 22 should say that if Qualities are reduced by stress while any Quality is 0.  As written just the act of losing a roll (which always causes stress) will replace a character who has a 0 quality regardless of how many bonds are present.  Not sure which way that is meant to be.  EDIT:  I found the answer on page 30...it is only if Qualities get reduced.  If you do any revisions to the text you'll likely want to adjust page 22 accordingly.<br/><br/>Step 6 on narrating the outcome indicates that the player whos turn it is always narrates the outcome...the example is if they won a conflict, but the implication is that they are narrating even their own failures.  Is that correct?  It's also unclear if the collaboration with the other players also includes the Director as one of the other players, since a little later you specifically call the Director out by name.

First of, THANKS for playing 44. Sounds like you had a great time. And, it also sounds like your game wen't pretty well, and well within the bounds of how I play the game, too. Here are some answers -- hope these help: \n<blockquote>-Is there a limit to the number of agents that the Director can activate in a scene? This might be in the text but I couldn't find it at the table. There was a classic pod-people-esque scene where like 4 npcs who had become agents all turned on the nurse character, but I'm not 100% sure it was legal...</blockquote>\nThere is no limit as written. What you did is pretty heavy! But, legal.<br/>\n<blockquote>-What is the procedure on declaring the use of secrets/anxieties? The game has a fair amount of strategy, and there was a bit of "well, are you using a secret? Because that affects whether I'm using an anxiety." Who declares first? Or do we both declare in secret and then reveal?</blockquote>\nThere are no rules on who declares first. I have no problem with players changing their minds about triggering Anxieties (or not) at the "last second" before rolls. That's acceptable. I've not played it any times where the reveal is secret. I always let fellow players know how many dice I had, and how many penalties, too.\n<blockquote>-Is there an "end of turn" sequence right before the Zero hour? It felt kind of weird to roll resistance vs. menace, have a cut scene, immediately roll resistance vs. menace again and then have epilogues.</blockquote>\nNo, there is no end of turn sequence before the zero hour. Jump right to the zero hour after the last player in Countdown 1 finishes his or her scene. Basically, the zero hour replaces the end of turn roll.\n<blockquote>-Who narrates the epilogues?</blockquote>\n44 does not specify "narration" at any point in the game. This was intentional -- mainly to encourage people to act out and tell the story more "naturally." There is a reference to the Director resolving any disputes, which could mean he has final \x7fauthority on narration in theory. In practice, the group collaborates, and hopefully role-plays out, any parts of the scene. <br/><br/>When I have played, usually the person playing a character describes most of the epilogue (and, people tend to be pretty brutal towards their characters, which is interesting). And, at the same time, almost always someone else tosses in a twist to the epilogue and the player (usually) happily accepts it.\n<blockquote>-How secret is the information about the conspiracy (what their goal is, their methods, the stuff the director writes down at the beginning of play? I kept that from the players, but then when it came time to narrate cut-scenes, which are supposed to be collaborative, the players kept narrating in stuff that threw my plans massively for a loop, and I had to bargain them down (this actually produced a cool hybrid, as it turned out...). How much control does the director have over the content of the conspiracy? How does that affect the group free-form narration in the cut scenes?</blockquote>\nI'm pretty open about it when I play. That is, 44 isn't really a "discovery" game, it's a suspense game. If we all know, as the audience, what nasty thing might be behind the door, it's suspenseful (yes, surprises can be too, but it doesn't work as well in 44). <br/><br/>The Director has lots of authority about the Secrets, and also of the general stuff 44 does, the behind the scenes stuff, etc. But, I'm usually very open to players who say things like "You know what would be awesome is ... " I try to incorporate their ideas. But, there' s nothing wrong with saying no, 44 doesn't work like that, too. You have the authority as Director to do that.<br/>\n<blockquote>-As director, I was terrified of being forced to take a big hit to control and thus sucking the tension out of the game. Was this ever a problem in playtests, and is there a good way to deal with that if it arises?</blockquote>\nUsually, the problem was that the Director just dominated. Mechanically speaking, yes, it's possible that the Director just gets overwhelmed and doesn't really have a shot at winning any scenes. In practice, this hasn't been very common. THere are a few mechanisms in place to keep this from happening much.<br/><br/>I advise ramping up that Prgram to at least 2, using lots of secrets in play, and pumping up Control with Reserve dice (and when you lose scenes) to help with this concern.<br/>\n<blockquote>-How exactly is scene framing supposed work? It seemed like there were a couple of ways to interpret the instructions. The first possibility was that ALL you use to frame the scene is the three details, plus whatever hints you have from the way the last scene ended. Then as soon as the scene starts whoever talks first de facto fills in the rest through context. This seemed to lead to people packing as much as possible into their details. </blockquote>\nThis is essentially how I play it, yes. However, I don't usually have people trying to go overboard on details. Usually, they're just kick starts for a scene, or a way to make sure Anxieties or Bonds are present right away, like conflict "insurance." \n<blockquote>The way we ended up doing things was that the scene would have a basic concept (kind of like the scene agenda from PTA), and then the details would give time, place, context, etc, for that to happen. For example, we had a scene where the nurse wanted to confront the doctor who gave her mother the mysterious "treatment." Her detail: I've finally got him in the room with me at his hospital. My detail: The hospital is a mental institution. The other players: And he's a patient. Should the details just set a place and time, rather than a premise for the scene?</blockquote>\nDetails aren't limited strictly to place and time. They can introduce characters or even mood, perhaps. Sounds like you were pretty close to how I play it. <br/><br/>Packing more than a basic fact or possibly two into a detail means you're doing too much. If one person says "I'm drinving my car at night," that's fine. If a person says "I'm driving my car at night, the radio's on, and Betty's in the back seat." That's WAY too much for their one detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237991/#Comment_237991" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-17T16:03:02+00:00" title="October 17, 2009  4:03PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 17, 2009 4:03PM by Matt Snyder.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ralph. Sadly, I will again miss Go Play Peoria, as I'm on the road to Michigan. You know, to watch those 7 and 0 Hawkeyes with my brother, who lives there now. \n<blockquote>Another scene framing question building on the above: The order for details say clearly: Player's detail, Director's detail, then other player's collective detail. But then farther down on the page there's a cryptic reference to "Sometimes, the Director will start a scene instead." Does this mean that sometimes the detail order is switched with the Director going first? How is that decided / When does that happen? Or does it just mean that sometimes the Director's detail will be the one that sends the scene into motion? Or what? If both the player and the Director have a direction they want to go to kick off the scene...how do you determine who's action "goes off" first?</blockquote>\n<br/>Ah. This just means that <i>after</i> the 3 details are done, either the player or the director start talking / role-playing. There's no official "The Director must talk first" kind of thing is all.<br/>\n<blockquote>Also, clearly, a scene will consist of more details than just the initial three and that those three are just the idea spring board. But I'm not finding any additional guidance. The example on page 16 clearly provides the player with a degree of directoral stance power, but I don't find any restrictions or Director veto on its use, is there any? </blockquote>\nYes, players have plenty of directorial stance power. No, the Director doesn't have explicit veto power. He "settles disputes" which, yeah, is basically veto power.<br/>\n<blockquote>Also, are the other players permitted to continue to add details, or is the initial detail <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> their only official contribution outside of playing any of their characters that appear. Or do they individually have the same directoral stance power in another player's scene with regards to playing their character in that scene?</blockquote>\nOther players are welcome to contribute stuff as the scene goes along. But, if their characters aren't actually present, it's up the player and director (or the player an the Operative) to decide whether to include that stuff.<br/><br/>If a player is assisting, his say-so is basically like that of the player. The assisting player is participating actively through his character, rather than just cheering/jeering from the sidelines.<br/><br/>Basically, at no point in the entire game, should anyone "shut up" necessarily. Chime in, by all means. But, it's up to active players to decide whether that stuff "happens."<br/>\n<blockquote>Triggering Anxieties: The rules indicate that player's MAY trigger anxieties and do not indicate that the Director has the option of triggering them for them. Is that by design. It seems reasonable to be that if Mr. Clark is high on the bridge but the player doesn't choose to trigger his fear of hieghts Anxiety that the Director should be able to do so...simpy on the grounds that's its kind of odd for a player to control when their characters are or aren't going to be anxious. By the rules I don't see where this is permitted.</blockquote>\nThis is not permitted, on purpose.<br/><br/>The reason is two-fold. First, the game is designed with the intent that players are making choices about 1) the person they control (i.e. their character) and 2) about how that character helps or doesn't help other human beings. Therefore, choices that the Director forces upon players contradicts that intent.<br/><br/>Second, another component of the game is determining when and how the people handle their fears. Forcing them, at whim, to suffer their terror when the playe r wanted them to "overcome" is, again, contrary to my intent.<br/><br/>I totally see how groups would want to drift this like you describe as a way to alter the strategies of the game. That's cool.<br/>\n<blockquote>Page 22 "Too Much Stress" is a little unclear. Earlier the order was established that Stress is first applied to Bonds and then to Qualities. On page 22 it states that if any stress is received while a Quality is 0 the character is Replaced. How does the presence of Bonds when that happens effect this? It would seem in line with the game's design that you could use Bonds as a "shield" to absorb stress to avoid being replaced by keeping your character in contact with his bonds until one by one they're replaced. But if that were the case then page 22 should say that if Qualities are reduced by stress while any Quality is 0. As written just the act of losing a roll (which always causes stress) will replace a character who has a 0 quality regardless of how many bonds are present. Not sure which way that is meant to be. EDIT: I found the answer on page 30...it is only if Qualities get reduced. If you do any revisions to the text you'll likely want to adjust page 22 accordingly.</blockquote>\nGood point. Yes, the Bonds <i>always</i> prevent the stress. You're right -- Bonds are "shields." Always.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238193/#Comment_238193" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T13:03:50+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  1:03PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Matt, gratz on finally getting this game out there!
