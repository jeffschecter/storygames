It also helped us very much with scene framing, which is something else we're rusty at.  <br/><br/>Those two games have really changed the tone and content of my gaming table, for the better i'd say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172849/#Comment_172849" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T11:11:57+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 11:11AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'know, just a little side point ... but when <b>I</b> have to ask myself "Is this person assuming I'm an idiot?" and I can't find definite evidence one way or the other, I usually find it less stressful to assume that no, they're not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172852/#Comment_172852" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T11:21:49+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 11:21AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, okay.

Darned, this a very interesting subject, and not something, that is entirely alien to me ...<br/><br/>How about the shared experience as the basis for a "secret" society. The concept that everybody plays the same scenario, and that you can identify those who played the game and share the secret of the game.<br/><br/>In one fastaval-scenario the players were obliged to sign a contract on non-disclosure about what they had played - it was some sort of psychological horror - otherwise they could not participate. This scenario: <a href="http://alexandria.dk/data?scenarie=52" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://alexandria.dk/data?scenarie=52</a><br/>If you add this to the "ritual" of the game, you might enhance the feeling of a shared secret. You might even make it some sort of ordeal to complete the game.<br/><br/>I know this most likely isn't what you looking for, but it was what came to my mind.

We play with the following rule:<br/>Every player can once during each conflict/scene play out a cut-scene, in which they address the audience of the reality show (the player speaks out openly), and where they speak rudely about the other players (just like in the reality shows), and once this is done, the player is either rewarded XP (if non-conflict scene) or bonus dice (conflict-scene). We've had quite some fun with this, as the player characters take turns gossiping about their fellow characters - and being rewarded for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173090/#Comment_173090" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T21:13:42+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  9:13PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To make the game bleed into the real-world social dynamics, you have to have real-world consequences. Like, for example, instead of losing hit points, you lose fingers. Just imagine how the real-world social dynamics change when the fucking cleric heals Sarah instead of you, and that means the loss of your pinky at the end of the encounter.<br/><br/>Another way to blur the line between RL and game is something that people have been doing and talking about for quite a while on the Forge: techniques that involve getting at issues people at the table care about or have some RL stake in -- i.e., Narrativism plus certain amplifying techniques. Imagine a game where, during character creation, the player to the left of you got to graft on a personality trait or issue that was based on their perception of you-the-player. Now you're explicitly playing a version of your real self at the table. This has the potential to change real-world social dynamics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/toilet%20psychic" title="toilet psychic"><img alt="toilet psychic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/toilet%20psychic">toilet psychic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173145/#Comment_173145" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T04:34:11+00:00" title="October  4, 2008  4:34AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this is what you seek but have you heard about <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.mirlandano.com/arg-quickstart.html" rel="nofollow">alternate reality games</a> ?

Breaking people down into pieces? Then Scapegoat is your kind of fun.<br/><br/>Secretly choose one player to be the scapegoat. The scapegoat could be a man or a woman. If the scapegoat is a woman and the other players are all men, Scapegoat can be even more enjoyable. We will assume he is a man. If the scapegoat knows that he is going to be the scapegoat, he will not play, so all the other players must pretend that you are playing another game. It can be another roleplaying game, a board game or even, for advanced players, a group therapy session.<br/><br/>Each of the other players chooses a quality to be triggered by the scapegoat. This can be for example, passive-aggressive, easily offended, snitch, sneering or belittling.<br/><br/>During game play, any player can make the secret signal \u2013 a right thumb on the table will suffice, and, in passing mention one of the other players. That player should, within five minutes, use their quality against the scapegoat. Once they have, each other player secretly votes with a left thumb on the effectiveness and realism of the acting player. Votes are tallied, and play continues clockwise around the table. The player who causes the scapegoat to stop playing the game loses all their points, and the game ends. Points are tallied and the victor is declared.<br/><br/>If you have played correctly, the scapegoat will hate you and your friends, and may post about you on the internet. You will have to judge whether telling the scapegoat they have been playing is more or less fun than keeping it a secret.<br/><br/>Variants<br/><br/>Experienced players can start the game at any time simply by making the secret signal; other players can improvise their qualities as they are required.<br/><br/>Single Player Scapegoat. Choose a game where you are the GM. Use all the listed qualities and techniques to spoil the game for all the other players. It's important that they stay playing for as long as possible. If you spoil their enjoyment of roleplaying games altogether, you win.<br/><br/>In Reverse Scapegoat, everyone sets out to make the other player feel good. The appearance of sincerity is a must. The game ends when the scapegoat makes a general statement about how kind everybody is being. You must not reveal that you were playing reverse scapegoat. Playing a game of Scapegoat with the same scapegoat immediately afterwards is particularly enjoyable.<br/><br/>In Scapegoat Freak-Out, players make creepy comments or perform actions that make no sense. The aim is to freak the scapegoat out. When they are freaked out, the game ends. If this is taking too long, any player may stand up and declare Freak Out loudly. Everyone marches around the scapegoat, pointing and laughing, then leave the room.<br/><br/>In ScapeWord each player picks a word. Whenever the scapegoat says your word, you get a point. There are no turns. You can encourage the scapegoat to say your word, or not say others' words, but not directly.<br/><br/>In Scapegoat Extreme, you can only win if the scapegoat hits you. This is a dangerous game. Do not play in bars - it is too easy. You get extra points if you are hit by a nun, police officer or marshal artist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173430/#Comment_173430" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T04:53:43+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  4:53AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, that's pretty evil, yes.

So it is a sort of controlled or limited cheating, which is quite fun (played with good frineds), since it create the just right atmosphere of paranoia and distrust.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis" title="Morten Greis"><img alt="Morten Greis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis">Morten Greis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173447/#Comment_173447" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T06:19:49+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  6:19AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><br/><br/>I'm wondering: Perhaps it's much easier to design games that provoke dysfunction, than games that make your group function<i>better</i>?

Having participants write down answers for pre-set questions and then play around with those, creating the most disturbing scenario possible for the group. If everyone trusts each other it could work wonders, if in doubt it would be time bomb (that would be COOL). But I would realy go with some Jeepform, larp or story-game in setting type of thing with this to enchance the feeling and effect.<br/><br/>Work with themes like sexual violence, suicide, depression, personal fears or something like that would possibly work best, since we all have strong feelings about those. I'm not talking only about mindfucking or breaking the social structures (which is cool thou) but also building new social contracts, new "strings" to connect people and maybe rethink existing ones.<br/><br/>I hope I'm not thought insane becouse of this post, but what the heck.
