The Saturday day game went well, and the Friday game had some problems. These observations are mostly about the Friday game.<br/><br/>I definitely encourage everyone who played with me to get a copy of the game from Ben and read it so you can compare how we played to the actual rules. <br/><br/>* Microscope does not follow the normal pattern of play so it's important to make that clear to new players and to highlight the differences when they come up because otherwise people drift back to normal play patterns. I didn't do this clearly enough so many concepts were confusing.<br/><br/>* I got feedback that people wanted to continue playing their characters after the question of the scene had been answered to learn more about them. In Microscope, there is no concept of "my character," and scenes are played until the question is answered and no longer. That said, if players are interested in knowing more about a character, they can keep framing more scenes around that character or make them the focus. I don't think I illustrated or explained this part of the game very well.<br/><br/>* The players wanted to name characters, but I actively discouraged it which seemed to throw people for a loop. While there's no rule against naming characters, I think the idea is to name characters selectively because it reinforces the idea that these characters are but a small part of what could be a large and vast history. Players said they wanted to name characters as a first step towards making them interesting which makes sense if I didn't explain how to explore characters per my previous bullet.<br/><br/>* Several of us, definitely myself, were pretty tired and I brought a beer to the game after the beer at dinner. Microscope is an equal participation, heavy thinky, heavy listening, heavy concentration game and being tired and fuzzy-brained is not a good way to play. This is not a new lesson: Ben, Tony, Paul and I already learned that drinking, weariness and Microscope don't mix very well. Also, the room was loud and thumpy. It was the loudest room in the theatre, but we didn't know it at the time. Being able to easily hear other players is essential for Microscope so this was a problem.<br/><br/>* Both games had 5 players which really pushes the boundaries. It certainly can work well, but playing scenes with 5 usually means at least one, maybe two people are playing secondary roles (because every character can't talk at once or be central), and then it takes just that much longer for the Current Player or Lens to get back around to you. It's easier to disengage from the game, and on Friday this was made even worse by a difficult playing environment.<br/><br/>Many thanks to everyone who played Friday and Saturday. Again, I encourage everyone to read the rules, and I am interested in hearing from the players what they think about my observations or the games.<br/><br/>(I was in the middle of writing this post and saw that <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9530&amp;page=1#Item_42" rel="nofollow">Daniel Wood posted some feedback on this game</a>.

Some of these points are going straight into playtest update <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, which I'm sending out to playtesters shortly. It's mostly just clarifications on areas that may be confusing -- no rule changes yet.<br/><br/>And yeah, tired Microscope is always a bad plan. My new rule is if you shouldn't be operating heavy machinery, you probably shouldn't be playing Microscope.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217934/#Comment_217934" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-12T23:29:51+00:00" title="July 12, 2009 11:29PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forgot to add: I didn't want to bore everyone by reading the rules so I went with the explain via play method. As a result because Tone Debt and Legacies often don't occur naturally at the beginning of game, I didn't really get a chance to explain or illustrate them to show the players the different things they can do during scenes and also therefore how the Light/Dark mechanics work. Knowing the constraints of time for a con-slot, I think I could have moved it along faster by throwing down a legacy and generating tone quickly on my turns and if I facilitate again with new players, I might try to do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217936/#Comment_217936" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-12T23:52:22+00:00" title="July 12, 2009 11:52PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I keep meaning to say that I feel like the tone of this and other discussions around the game is maybe a bit misleading -- I actually quite enjoyed the session and I never felt like things were dragging or boring or whatever. I do think some more examples (or in-play occurences) of Tone Debt &amp; Legacies (Ralph did eventually play a Legacy, I believe) might have been cool, but I didn't feel like the game fell apart because they were missing. It was more like there were some widgets we just weren't using, and in some cases that seemed to be because we didn't understand them but in others it seems like maybe we just didn't want to use them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218186/#Comment_218186" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T00:26:31+00:00" title="July 14, 2009 12:26AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2009 12:57AM by ping.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Daniel, I'm glad you enjoyed it!
