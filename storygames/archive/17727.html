You don't have the constrained choices as per Fiasco, which is an important difference. (Hm, pity Fiasco isn't under Creative Commons, I see a hack coming...) PCs will absolutely conflict -- it's a bit more driven there than Fiasco, since everyone will have at least one desire directed at another PC and that PC will have a stated reason not to grant it. The obstacles to success are more built into the mechanics.<br/><br/>The other featured system is a currency system that nicely balances out the decision to grant those desires or not. So a bit more structure than Fiasco. The best way to think of this from a Fiasco perspective is that Hillfolk puts the positive/negative outcome weight on the individual characters; if I get what I want out of you, it's a positive for me but not necessarily for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/huckabees" title="huckabees"><img alt="huckabees" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/huckabees">huckabees</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401412/#Comment_401412" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-21T06:57:05+00:00" title="December 21, 2012  6:57AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The one thing I hate about hearing about games like Hillfolk is that I can't immediately buy the pdf and start reading it right now (it hasn't been released yet, has it?

You play dysfunctional humans in a contemporary France. The game system is an improved Dogs in the Vineyard. What I discovered was how fun it was to play slow scenes without anything happening on the surface, and how a game system can direct how you act out your character.<br/><br/>Another surprise is the Swedish <b>While the World Ends</b>. It got a really cool mechanic that lets you create relations, otherwise you wont get what you need. Both sessions I had were great.<br/><br/>Both these games above seemed really boring, until I tried them.<br/><br/>Another surprise, and this is about enjoyment in a game, was the thrill of just throwing yourself out into nothing and exploring a story. The game that achieved that feeling was the Norwegian <b>Archipelago</b>.<br/><br/>And of course, the Swedish (and non-existent) <b>Svart av kval, vit av lust</b> (Black of Despair, White of Lust). A vampire game that is what Vampire should be. The mechanic is both simple and really genius.<br/><br/>Surprisingly all the games above are GM less.<br/><br/>I tried and playtested heaps of games this year thanks to a new RPG group that I found: my own This Is Pulp and Thrice, Bad Family, The Coyotes of Chicago, The Shadow of the Trees, The Daughters of Verona, Polaris, In a Wicked Age, Sea Dracula, A Thousand Years Under The Sun, GxB, Fiasco, Dragon Stone, A Taste for Murder, My Life With Master and Montsegur 1244.

It's a game about vampires, their desires and their inner beast. It's a setting free and GM free game so you have to discuss an environment that has some sort of vampires in it. We've been playing in worlds like the Caribbean with voodoo priests as vampire hunters, and in a futuristic North Korea with bio-created vampires and a revived Kim Il Sung.<br/><br/>You take the roles of elder and younger vampires that are connected through a relationship map, and where a situation has come to change the status quo in the city. It's time put your agenda into work. All vampires has an anchor - a human - that they really care about. It's their last connection to humanity. To loose the anchor is to loose humanity. As you probably understand, the game is about putting a vampire's anchor in the way of anyone's agenda.<br/><br/>The conflict resolution is simple. Elder vampires always win over younger vampires, unless the younger ones let loose the Beast. The Beast is the violent side of the vampire and hate it's human side. It wants to be fierce. To create chaos and despair. It also wants to ridicule it's host. To unleash the beast, is to solve a conflict in the most violent way possible. This means that if the younger vampires wants to reach their agenda, they path must sooner or later be filled with blood.<br/><br/>The Beast always tries to get control over the vampire, which is done by the other participants commanding a player to do something violent, cruel or to do something that humiliate the host. The vampire may resist the urge, but must in that case take a token. At any time the vampire unleash the Beast to win a conflict, anyone may take away a token. That means the Beast is refusing and the vampire has lost the conflict.<br/><br/>I can give an example of what happened during a game at a convention. A young vampire's anchor was a human that he loved. During one scene, a participant gave him a Beast command by saying "Take her as yours". He sat for a couple of minutes, trying to make the love interest to answer his feelings.

Could you tell more about this one? Is it available in English?</blockquote>\nI don't think it's available in English and I don't know where to get it. I learned the game through <a href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">@Simon_Pettersson</a> who speaks French, and who brought it to a gaming convention.<br/><br/>You start the game by coming up with a tilting event, like "a father that everybody thought were dead returns" or "there is now known that a member in a gentlemen's society is gay". Then you create characters, mostly by discussion. Every player comes up with two traits each to their characters: "police" or "married with Susan". After that, you create something that's the opposite of another character's trait. Like "Been to prison" or "It's not Peter's child".<br/><br/>As you can tell, here is where all the troubles are created, but it also binds everybody to each other in a tight relationship map.<br/><br/>The conflict is usually played out through a conversation. It works similar to Dogs in the Vineyard, but uses cards instead and is less tricky. Each "round", you may draw cards by calling out one of the four aspects - avoiding, manipulating, caring (and one more that I can't remember) - and one of the six moods: anger, mellow, sadness, happiness etc. The aspects and moods tells you how to play out the conversation. And because the aspects and the moods can change from round to round, the conversation will take turns. For example, one person can be happy while manipulating the other person, and after a while it may turn to angry and caring. "Don't you see that I'm just trying to help you?!"<br/><br/>You can also call out one of your traits each round - "police", "It's not Peter's child". And as you probably can tell, they tend to stir up things. "Why do you care?! It's not your child anyway!" Each conflict will give you a mental backlash (in game terms: it raises your stats). The backlash depends on how many cards you drew and if you lost any rounds during the conflict. So it's a choice: should you draw a lot of cards and possibly win the conflict or should you consider yourself beaten?<br/><br/>The conflict resolution could be smoother, because you sometimes forget what have been said after you've drawn your cards, but I'm a little angry about myself for not thinking of using moods like this. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> It's actually the combination of aspects and moods that makes the conversation alive. Just having "anger" and "sadness" would make the participant to play it out the same way all the time, but being angry while avoiding or caring are two totally different things.<br/><br/>[edit] Oh, and one more thing. You should play everything slow. Slow scenes. Should put most of the energy in bringing forth a mood. Scenes without a content. Just showing how you feel IC. Play it slow up to the conflict, where all hell breaks loose. The father is drunk and forces himself into the house to finally see his daughter. His ex-wife screams at him and tries to push him out of the house, and her new husband looks at everything in despair. The teenage daughter wakes up and looks down the stairs to see what's going on. Her mum looks up at her and says: "Look what you're father have become!" (She won that conflict when we played.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401610/#Comment_401610" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-23T14:20:23+00:00" title="December 23, 2012  2:20PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2012 2:20PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/109348/Deadlands-Noir?filters=0_2140_0_0_0" rel="nofollow">Deadlands Noir</a> - YUPPPPPPP THAT HAPPENED</blockquote>\nhahahaha what\n<blockquote><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/108315/Kuro?filters=0_2140_0_0_0" rel="nofollow">Kuro</a> - came out of nowhere with a J-horror game that actually seems like a J-horror game<br/></blockquote>\nI'm really curious about this one.

I haven't got 100 % insight, but I've heard there's a major rules revision between these two versions (basically a whole new system for the new one).<br/><br/>Rickard and Simon have played the older version, and IIRC Simon prefers it over the new one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403291/#Comment_403291" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-10T04:02:29+00:00" title="January 10, 2013  4:02AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Correct. I keep playing the old playtest version called Psychodrame. I've read the new version called Les cordes sensibles, but I haven't played it. After reading it I found it changed in many ways and since I like the old version so much, that's what I've been playing. Since I haven't tried the new one, however, I can't claim it's not as good. I just think the old one is so good I don't want to change it.<br/><br/>Also, for the people who are interested in Svart av kval, vit av lust, I made a thread about it <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17821/svart-av-kval-vit-av-lust-i-will-answer-any-questions" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
