However,perhaps these ideas can be used to illuminate some aspect of publishing.<br/><br/>Games - defined here as "instances of actual play based on a game text"- are spread through play. They are like parasites, gamers are their happy hosts. <br/><br/>Games are made up of gemes. (Yes, it's a word I just made up by smashing together "genes" and "memes"). Gemes are ideas, techniques and processes - things that are used in actual play.<br/><br/>Games survive based on how successful their combination of gemes are. However, they're <i>born</i> through their seeds - the game texts - interacting with a host who decides to nurture the seed. <br/><br/>This interaction requires, first, that the seed in contact with a host, which happens for example A) if the host gets the seed pushed on him by another enthusiastic host (who may or may not be actually nurturing his own seed); <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> the host is actively seeking out new seeds; C) someone has something to gain from pushing the seeds on the host (money or status).<br/><br/>The seed may not always be nurtured into a game after exposure. That depends, for a large part, on the gemes matching the host's preferences.<br/><br/>You can track both the spread of games, and of specific gemes - just as you can track both the spread of species, and specific genes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72593/#Comment_72593" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T02:46:07+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  2:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like this idea for some reason.<br/><br/>Does that mean there are selfish gemes? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72596/#Comment_72596" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T03:39:13+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  3:39AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shouldn't the seed (the game text) be called a "gamete"?<br/><br/>Seriously, though, if you apply a genetic/memetic metaphor to games, then gameplay is the phenotype of the text-as-DNA. And players become the environment and medium that both influences the development of that phenotype and through which that development is expressed.<br/><br/>So, ironically, focusing on the text emphasizes the importance of what's happening around the table--the level of social contract, if you will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
