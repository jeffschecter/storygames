I know I'm not the only Story Gamer with a game up there. There's <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/37997" rel="nofollow">Zombie Cinema</a> and <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/25045" rel="nofollow">Mechaton</a>, for example.<br/><br/>So what can my fellow SG-ers tell me of this strange land? Have you found BGG a useful place to promote your game? What were your experiences? Do you find games through BGG, and if so, how?<br/><br/>I'd like to collect my epxeriences and maybe some others in a blog post that might be useful to indie gamers looking to promote their game, or just manage their public exposure.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177626/#Comment_177626" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T15:23:18+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  3:23PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BGG is the primary online community for many boardgamers, but for many others it's first and foremost a dictionary of boardgame information. I myself, for instance, belong in the portion of users who don't have an account and basically use BGG only as a more comprehensive and reliable replacement for Wikipedia when it comes to the boardgame specialty. For that sort of audience the only way to leverage BGG for promotion is to link to the BGG entry when appropriate - it gives your game a certain frisson of boardgamerish credibility if you do. Of course, if the game's entry is mostly empty, that's a bit sad. Thinking back on how I myself use BGG entries, a review is often the first thing I'm looking for concerning a game I look up - last week I looked up <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/37349" rel="nofollow">Cthulhu Rising</a>, for instance, and benefited well for the review material on the site. Another thing many people look for are images of the game components, being how that provides a lot of information about the structure and production quality of the game.<br/><br/>I don't know of the user community itself, how they work socially or whether certain sorts of BGG entries have hooks that could be leveraged in marketing. I know that the community has an element of self-inforcement in that many users have a strong inclination for collecting plays or copies of games on the various top lists generated by the community out of user evaluations - some of my boardgamer friends here in Finland have made a point of playing through the current top 20, top 50 or some such lists often enough, for example. As for how <i>Zombie Cinema</i> got on the site, Yoki Erdman from Sweden was good enough to add it - he's got an user account and obviously enough knows his way around the community there. I should've provided him with some pictures for the game, but I'm only now getting around to putting some up on our own site, and I see he's already procured some very snazzy shots of his own.<br/><br/>I've done a bit of promoting my game as a boardgame here in Finland (putting it in my sig. on the Finnish Boardgame Society boards and such), but I'm rather low-profile about it; ultimately the great majority of boardgamers are pretty lukewarm about a story game that stresses personal creativity, so there's little sense in shouting about it and bothering everybody with chaff that goes out of the way of the play preferences of the majority. The parts that are mostly interesting for the boardgaming scene are the production logistics, really, as they're relevant for boardgame indies - I've already recommended our card printer, Guild of Blades, to many people who're looking for affordable small-run card printing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177627/#Comment_177627" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T15:38:58+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  3:38PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2008 3:39PM by blankshield.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/13812" rel="nofollow">Brick Battles</a> and <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/36507" rel="nofollow">Blood and Bronze</a> are both on BGG.

The rankings, hot threads and things like that absolutely drive sales - I've spent quite a bit of money based on them. But as far as strong advice on how to go about getting on an influential geeklist like "Ten Interesting New Games that Weren't at Essen" (just an example), I have no idea. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there's the wiki aspect of it all. If I saw such a geeklist and clicked through to the Mechaton entry, I wouldn't pursue it any further. There are only two forum threads. There is not much clear description of how the rules work. Just being listed is not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that much like the indie RPG community, it can absolutely be a key marketing method, but it requires a lot of time and attention to its culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177651/#Comment_177651" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T03:15:05+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  3:15AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend spent lots and lots of time around BGG, using it both for the community and the shopping guide aspect.

The more random a game is, the worse it will be ranked. So something like Magic the Gathering isn't even in the Top 100.<br/><br/>But aside from that, he also spoke pretty highly of it and then went on to spend ~1000\u20ac or more on BGG-recommened board games. ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177653/#Comment_177653" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T04:45:16+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  4:45AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a really useful resource to me, and certainly informs all my board game purchases.

It's like any game community, you have your cliques and factions. Most people are pretty cool, but most of the regulars are there for specific kinds of games, and they will turn their nose up at games outside of that realm. That said, there are a LOT of old skool D&amp;D players, and you will see those games crop up on some of the geeklists and discussions.<br/><br/>Crossover games are a strange creature. I actually will have a review of a hybrid style game called Aunt Millie's Millions that will go in this weekend's paper and ultimately turn up on the Geek. You claim cards with different dollar values as you squable over Millie's estate, but you are encouraged to come up with a back story for your "character" and if two people claim the same card, they plead their case in-character to a third player, who then awards the item to the one with the best story/argument. That game has seen some love among traditional gamers, even though there is a huge story-game element.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont" title="chaldfont"><img alt="chaldfont" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont">chaldfont</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177658/#Comment_177658" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T05:26:40+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  5:26AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about story games, but a friend of mine recently sold out of a 1000 copy print run of his <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/27463" rel="nofollow">very first boardgame</a> largely due to building buzz on boardgamegeek.

I'd guess I sold a few dozen copies to BGG-ers, so it's been very nice for me. That said, the community has some rules and ways of doing things that are not always obvious. For example, when I gave my game a high rating, I was politely told that BGG-ers frown mightily on that sort of behavior and warned that I was risking a relatiatory rate-down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177666/#Comment_177666" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T07:22:08+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  7:22AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chaldfont</cite>I don't know about story games, but a friend of mine recently sold out of a 1000 copy print run of his<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/game/27463" rel="nofollow">very first boardgame</a>largely due to building buzz on boardgamegeek.

For instance recent game purchases include Galaxy Trucker which I'd only ever heard of from the Geek;  Mutant Chronicles which I used the Geek to research the release I'd seen at Gen Con before buying, and Senator a Fantasy Flight Card Game I researched on the Geek after having stumbled across it on FF's site browsing upcoming Mutant Chronicles releases.  I rarely ever buy a board game without checking out the geek first.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, my FLGS has the geek up on his store Point of Purchase system so that he can access it for his customers, and use it to inform his restocks.  When I stumbled across Fire &amp; Axe in the store...a game I knew nothing about except it had a sweet looking box and lots of little plastic vikings he pulled up the geek gave me its scores and let me read a review...SOLD...the game rocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have heard rumors for at least a couple of years about RPGGeek being in the works...but so far nothing solid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the BGG folks are involved with / behind Tanga.com, a Deal of the Day site which started out solely as game site where companies (like now gone Uberplay) could unload excess stock and gamers could fill out their collection at deep discount prices.  They've since branched out into the usual mix of great deals (like $150 EEEPCs) and silly crap (like a set of three remote control outlet plugs) but still do alot of games.  I just picked up Axis &amp; Allies Guadalcanal from them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also listed Universalis with them a while back.  They moved 63 copies in 30 minutes and I pocketed just about what I do when I sell to a distributor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEero, you should totally consider selling a batch of Zombie Cinema through them.  I bet they could move 50-100 copies easy...and they're always looking for product.

It's their decision. I do feel there has been a split of Eurogamers versus AT gamers (I refuse to use the "Ameri-Trash" phrase because no one, especially not fans, are going to get me to call the kinds of games I enjoy "trash.") and that split has taken up a lot of the board's energy in recent years.<br/><br/>However, I do think there is a lot of room for different games and discussion of different games. I think we are seeing more hybrid-style board and card games. And as always, I am just looking for things I find fun.

I've realized that I need to make this sort of thing for the Maid RPG to give to the retailers who carry the game. I realized that I needed to do it back in July. Because of the time commitment involved (and other pressing projects), I still haven't done it. I wager that it would take at least 5 hours of work at least, probably more like 8. It's not really fun work, but in my case the benefits would pay off. For Ryan, it doesn't seem like it would- and he's dealing with several games, not just one. And the market sounds like it would be like trying to post banner ads for GURPS over on the Forge's "First Steps: Design" forum or something. Sure, it might not be that much work... but if you know in advance that the payoff is going to be zilch, and your time is at a premium, that's actually a lot of resources.<br/><br/>Maybe the game climate over at BGG will settle down over time. But right now it seems like Ryan went in there hard, really got to know the ground, and realized that his efforts would be counter-productive.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177923/#Comment_177923" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-09T22:40:22+00:00" title="November  9, 2008 10:40PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm an advocate of market your game exactly as much as makes sense to you.

It'd just be the task of taking what they've got and posting it in a new place. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, at this point I am unashamedly arguing for the sake of argument. I've not gone to the GoB site to confirm this, and I don't necessarily think Ryan should do this.. It's just kind of a devil's advocacy kind of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, there's always the option that Eero took.. He could find himself a dedicated fan of his games who also happens to be a member of BGG to set up some pages for his games.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo skin offa my nose either way. Just seems like there ARE people on BGG who might be interested in Guild of Blades products (read: some of those very same people posting here, if no one else) even if the majority may not be, and it also seems like it would be negligible effort to put something up for those few. My perceptions may not match reality, but that's the risk you take whenever you make any claim.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178021/#Comment_178021" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-10T11:28:16+00:00" title="November 10, 2008 11:28AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our games are almost all listed on BGG.

The people who like historical boardgames read those - and the people who only like medium complexity operational level Eastern Front historical games only like those- and so on in smaller and smaller circles<br/><br/>Unhappy because someone rated your game a "3" or something? Get used to it - but no one pays any attention to ratings except in relative terms. (But if your game is rated lower than those in the same category, then you need to examine why). And if you promote your presence there, guess what? The people who like your games give them good ratings, write good reviews, upload pics of games in progress, ask questions, answer questions, and generally provide a support community. (The one thing BGG did better than anyone else is create a good software platform.)<br/><br/>So it is worse than stupid to take an opportunity with no downside and turn it an ego trip.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178060/#Comment_178060" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-10T14:13:13+00:00" title="November 10, 2008  2:13PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it possible for you to express the above without that last sentence/personal judgments?

I've been a miniatures gamer and boardgamer for 35 years - and started roleplaying with first edition D&amp;D. I like all periods and subgenres of all three - and that makes me feel like an outcast sometimes in just about every group.<br/><br/>As for BGG, I just ordered three historical board games. I made my choice from a larger list of similar games based on the information I found there. All the games I looked at were covered favorably at BGG - but these broke down into essentially ones that were playable in shorter periods of time and with less investment versus ones that are more simulationist. (Again, I like both, but BGG helped me decide which ones to get now, when I have limited funds.) The manufacturers sites varied from moderately helpful to no help at all. Only BGG gave me enough information to make a decision.<br/><br/>As for my contributions: I just posted a suggestion for handling multiple players in Combat Commander (a two-player card-driven game) that I need for the board-gaming group I'm in - and a way to get rid of the tactical combat chits in GMT's American Revolution system - making it both much quicker and suitable for solitaire play (for me, using Vassal).<br/><br/>I only just recently found out about story games - and I spent several weeks just tracking down references here and following them around to various blogs and reviews around the net trying to find out about the core games in the genre. If they had been on BGG, I would have had a much easier time of it. Most people would never have bothered to do the work in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178088/#Comment_178088" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-10T16:27:50+00:00" title="November 10, 2008  4:27PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;So it is worse than stupid to take an opportunity with no downside and turn it an ego trip.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eryops" title="Eryops"><img alt="Eryops" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i732.photobucket.com/albums/ww325/Tibor_02/ceilingcat22.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eryops">Eryops</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178254/#Comment_178254" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-12T00:05:44+00:00" title="November 12, 2008 12:05AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To address the original question posed - Yes, I love BGG. If I'm interested in a board game, it's the first place I'll check. It has superior search functions, and is better laid out than any other gaming website on the internet. Once RPGgeek.com goes live, I will probably abandon every other RPG site around, as the setup and functionality of BGG (and I presume it will be the same for RPGG) is so superior to the competition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
