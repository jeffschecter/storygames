Ten sessions, twenty sessions, forty sessions, whatever, just as long as there's a point at which THE END arrives and we can look back with satisfaction on it; I love going on a trip whether it's a short or a long one, but I hate walking on a treadmill.  The old school ideal of the neverending campaign, where you're playing the same characters over years and years...yeah, that sucks.  There's too much stuff I want to play for me to want to be chained to a single game in a single genre forever and ever.<br/><br/>I like campaigns when someone else is GMing them.  My interest in GMing a game waxes and wanes over time, but mostly it just wanes, and it feels like an awful chore.  My interest in playing, however, is a constant, so as a player I can stay fully engaged for week after week without any trouble.  Fortunately, we've got folks in our gaming group who are the opposite of me:  they thrive on GMing and get restless and unhappy if they spend too much time playing.  (Shared narrative authority games were a huge flop with our group -- just not fun at all for over half of us, and the only two people who actually enjoyed them get to scratch that itch elsewhere, so we're all cool with sticking to a standard GM/player arrangement.)<br/><br/>We did nothing but one-shots for a few months, and it was okay, but after a certain point I really missed being able to spend more time on things.  I missed being able to do longer-term character and plot development.  I missed character advancement, and being able to plan for character advancement.  And the steady diet of one-shots was limiting:  when you have to wrap things up in 4 hours, there are some things you just can't do properly.  <br/><br/>Also, sometimes I don't really "get" a game or a character right off the bat; if we ended everything we played after one session, I would have missed out on some awesome gaming experiences that only came four or five sessions in.  One-shots don't give anyone time for a slow burn: I would either have to ignite immediately or stay cold, with no other choices.  And sure, it'd be nice if everything caught fire for me right away, but that is not actually how the world works.<br/><br/>We tend to do campaign-length games regularly now, with occasional one-shot or two-shot "vacations" thrown in to suit various whims.  Because short games ARE fun!  They definitely still have their place at our table, but they'll never be the only thing on the menu again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_188792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188792/#Comment_188792" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-17T01:59:56+00:00" title="January 17, 2009  1:59AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Or least, I hate the fact that the ongoing campaign is held up so high as an ideal in the RPG hobby.</blockquote>I am agreeing and disagreeing with you on this. the ongoing campaign is a cultural phenomenon that I am a bit proud of, actually, although I see that it blocks a lot of other phenomenal practices in our hobby. The reason I am proud of it, is that it is an impressive show of shared creative longevity, and that it is quite unique in that aspect. I believe we underestimate the creative practice going on in thousands of role-playing groups all over the world. The positive, constructive, refining and enriching aspects of it is certainly under-reported in media.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite> I love the idea of being able to come back and revisit great characters and situations.</blockquote>So do I! All of us love this aspect of it, I believe.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I detest the way it encourages a lax approach to forward momentum of events and its delayed gratification.</blockquote>Yes, there is a lot of game-groups out there trotting on like creative snails, missing the chance to make great fiction out of their joint ventures into the shared imagined space.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I also dislike the way it encourages lengthy chargen and situation+setting creation.</blockquote>Oh, this is really something I dislike too. Lengthy chargen is so a frustratingly in-effective way of creating the real character (the character discovered during play, in dialogue with the fiction, the other characters, and the players ability to really <span style="text-decoration: underline;">play</span> his character.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I dislike the way it encourages and justifies the creation of involved and time consuming game mechanics.</blockquote>Oh, that one is as bad as the last one!

So here follows my comments to the light side of your post!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Games that can be explained in 10 minutes, even to non-RPGers/S-Gers.</blockquote>Totally in agreement with you on this! I like easy to play and easy to learn games. I do not like rules very much.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Games where, after 3-5 hours of play, the group has completed something, and even if they game is never touched again, people have had a really great experience.</blockquote>Yess! This is the ideal! After designing my first ever role-playing poetry, and testing it, having 15 minutes of intense game-play that made me and the other players hang with our heads in full sympathy with our characters ... after that experience I have less tolerance for games where hour after hour goes on with no immersion, little interaction and dying engagement. I want full immersion, blooming interaction and explding engagement! Now!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Games where a lead-gamer/GM can spend, at most 20-40  minutes reading and have an idea of what they're supposed to do.</blockquote>Blargh! Get some fiat at once and go with the flow, or die!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Games that are<b>not</b>meant to last for more than one session in connection, except for the really fanatical. Two sessions should be an accidental outlier. 3+ sessions? It shouldn't be the norm at all for a single story/series of events.</blockquote>I like both the campaign and the one-session games. But I certainly don't like the elements of many campaigns that you have described in your post. My experience is that a short, focused campaign is a format that suits me better. Doing a 5-sessions campaign just now, and I have high hopes for that one.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Games, and designers, that build systems based on the idea that stuff for the really enthusiastic players can wait! Put it  in a supplement. Put it online. For the love of god, don't put it in a core product!</blockquote>You are ironic here, yes? We do want stuff for really enthusiastic players, or? I for one want enthusiastic players, and then I want them to have stuff to keep their enthusiasm.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I also want games where the characters start as competent individuals, whatever that means in context. </blockquote>I want both. I want games where characters are competent, and I want games where they are newbies. I do both in my classical role-playing games, and have great fun with both. There are good things in both ways.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I want games that assume the players will customize/hack/modify the thing if they really love it, and that the designer doesn't have to cover every base.</blockquote>I want games which are easily modified, on the basis that I do not believe a designer capable of covering every venue of play. So I like robust, see-through systems which don't leave my players in the dark on what game-technical consequences a modification will have.<br/><br/>It has been a pleasure reading and answering your post, Robert!

Maybe I should clarify.<br/><br/>For me, I don't like long term play as the "center" of game thinking.<br/><br/>And what I mean by that is, I don't like the way so much emphasis is put on it in design circles ( and also play circles, for that matter).<br/><br/>Now around these parts where y'all dirty-hippy types hang out, I can certainly find some awesome ( br:<i> very nice</i>) short-form stuff.<br/><br/>If I could throw a big company example out:<br/>Back, I dunno, in the mid-90s, WW put out a quick-start kit for VtM online. It was about, oh, 30 pages long and included all kinds of actually useful stuff and easy to understand rules. They might even have been able to make it shorter or re-arranged it to make it even more "pick up and play". ( The included "Fetchit for the Prince" scenario sucked though)<br/><br/>A freebie promo item right?<br/><br/>Well, that points to the thing that bugs me right there: To me, that should have been <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> core product, because it cut right to the chase. I mean, it could have been betterer, but it was really close.<br/><br/>Folks here have made some good points about short (3-5 session) campaigns and what they can offer. I'll think more on those points, but off-hand I wish that those were considered "lengthy" not short, which, to me is kinda indicative of the thinking in the hobby culture that grates on me.<br/><br/>Edit:\n<blockquote><cite> Tom Moldvay version of Basic D&amp;D, page B3</cite> Each game session is called an <b>adventure</b>. An adventure lasts for as long as the players and the DM agree to play. An adventure begins when the party enteres the dungeon, and ends when the party has left the dungeon and divided up the treasure. An adventure may run for only an hour, or it might fill an entire weekend! The amount of playing time depends on the desire of the players and the DM.

It's against my religion to call anyone's fun wrong. However, it's not a discussion if there's only one side, so here I go.<br/><br/>Long campaigns give a great sense of achievement. You can look back at an awesome story that took months (or even weeks) to tell, and think "damn... I made <i>that</i>?" You look at a character sheet bloated with well-earned experience points and think back on how you deserved every god-damned point, every extra dot, every additional level, every new Sphere or Arcana or Art or Rote or spell or whatever. You can look at your character and think happily of what happens next. Is she still alive? Does she retire? How many of his personal issues are resolved? Is he happy now? Sad? Ready to grow? Ready to die? Maybe you share your thoughts with your fellow players, or maybe you just keep them happily to yourself. Or, maybe you even grow a new chronicle in the fertile soil of the old.<br/><br/>Long campaigns give you something to look forward to. Not just in the "I can look forward to playing this game every week for years" sense. You can also look forward to your character increasing in power a great deal, achieving his goals, overcoming his personal issues, and becoming integral to the setting. Now, I know you can design short run games to do the same thing, but in long running campaigns it feels more organic. It feels like you earn it every step of the way. It also feels like you can take your time with it. Even extremely character-focused short run games like, say Flowers for Mara, which center on characters changing and overcoming issues, feel rushed compared to the experience of coaxing a character through overcoming issues in a long form.<br/><br/>Finally, long running campaigns let you tell very big, very long stories. Stories with casts of thousands. World-hopping stories of epic proportions. You can't do stuff that big with short games, or if you can, I haven't.<br/><br/>I agree there are lots of things short games do better, but I believe there are some ways in which long games are superior.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188855/#Comment_188855" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-17T20:05:50+00:00" title="January 17, 2009  8:05PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, I don't like long campaigns that drag on forever either.

Personally, I keep 'em relatively short, 3 - 6 sessions on average, and if it goes any longer, it's still going to drive toward some sort of resolution.

It might leak out a little past that, but by the time we've hit double-digit sessions, I'm usually either feeling satisfied that things can come to an end, or that we fizzled out and continuing means we're we're delaying our next long-form game. I've never recaptured the magic fizz once it's left the bottle. <br/><br/>By the same token, nobody has their legs under them in fewer than 3 sessions -- if we can't make it to three, there's something deeply broken about what we're trying to do. So 3-10 sessions is the sweet spot for our ongoing games here. That usually results in 4-5 months of play at our typical rate. They probably average out to 6 or 7 strong sessions.<br/><br/>My absolute longest campaign was probably a Rolemaster thing that ran across two separate-but-interacting groups of players meeting twice a week for my entire time in college. That was literally <i>hundreds of sessions</i>. At that point it's really not a light diversion; it's a way of life. Totally impossible at this point in my life, and frankly it sounds godawful (to me, now, perched on the edge of 40).<br/><br/>Is anyone actively designing and pimping way-of-life games or gaming? Or is that something that just sort of <i>happens</i>? (On a related note, how does the math work out for D&amp;D4's progression from 1 to 20, in terms of typical hours/sessions of play? I'm betting that arc is programmed to be played out in about 1 year. I remember Lou Prosperi had worked that math for Earthdawn, and his aim was for, IIRC, 24 straight months of weekly play to go from start to top-circle characters.)<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188875/#Comment_188875" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T08:47:14+00:00" title="January 18, 2009  8:47AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JuddG</cite>I can think of several example of other things that do this same thing: bowling leagues, softball teams, fantasy football groups, etc.  Note that all of these are examples of games of some sort.

They lead to long term immersion, character and setting detail and complexity, emotional investment and ongoing build in verisimilitude. But at the same time they allow people to have a thing they're doing now, with a focus on the good part being right here and right now, and give structure and understanding to the development on an ongoing basis. Really, it isn't accidental that most ongoing fiction in most media and genres has methods of breaking itself up into chunks. <br/><br/>As far as the center of design and play philosophy goes... I sometimes wonder how true that is these days. I mean, I still know a lot of groups that want to play forever and always, and some few games designed to do that. But most games, and especially most Story Games, coming out these days seem more focused on shorter term play, or at least on cyclical play with adventures of limited duration building into a campaign over time. <br/><br/>I guess that's just a perception thing, but when folks talk about the ongoing, low-structure, more than a year long campaign as being the assumed default I get a thing in my head that's like "Sure, that was probably the case in the mid and late 90s, but I'm really not seeing it as being the case these days." <br/><br/>:;shrug:: Maybe I'm cut off from the mainstream or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlexS" title="AlexS"><img alt="AlexS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/4284/as32px.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlexS">AlexS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188895/#Comment_188895" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T13:48:00+00:00" title="January 18, 2009  1:48PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the moment I only do one-shots, but I miss the motivation buildup and involvement that comes from campaign play.

People certainly do regularly meet for structured group activities, including ones that require various degrees of continuity.  Besides sports teams playing over a season, there are choirs, bands, and amateur theater that all practice for a while.  <br/><br/>My experience with campaign play is that for me, it is often about getting to the good part more quickly.  Without a lot of prep, I find that single-session play often spends a lot of time on things that I don't enjoy so much <i>as a social activity</i> -- such as learning new rules and/or open negotiation over establishing the basic setting and situation.  I like having characters and situation already established so that we can immediately drop into character interaction and activity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188960/#Comment_188960" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T04:48:35+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  4:48AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Single-session games are okay, but they are like snacks. They often taste great, and you certainly remember them if they had something unusual going for them (a new player, a different system, a cool plot twist) but I couldn't live on them. After a while I feel like I'm suffering from a lack of depth, of complexity, of involvement.<br/><br/>Short campaigns (4-10 sessions) are not bad at all. I've had plenty of fun with them, and they can make a wonderful regime, especially with a rotating GM and game system. They are like going to the restaurant and having a great meal. You remember it for ages, and get nostalgic about it. But still, it's not the same as your daily bread. For me I still feel something missing about how deep into my character's (or world's) inner life I can get in that time. Or into the complexity of relationships, systems and background elements I can explore.<br/><br/>Long campaigns (50-100 sessions) are cool. Yes sometimes they drag, or loose fire, or trail off, and that's bad. They are regular meals, not fancy, but filling and sustaining. They let you delve so far into your fictional world that it becomes as real as the one outside the game, which for me is half the joy of gaming in the first place. With this many sessions you can have the most complex, and changing relationships. You can explore every facet of a setting, and you can tell epic story arcs that don't work in anything shorter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188963/#Comment_188963" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T05:53:25+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  5:53AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some games are designed for campaign play, and playing them for shorter periods I think loses much of their point.<br/><br/>I have in mind here games such as D&amp;D (any edition), BW, IaWA<br/><br/>PTAs an interesting case, being designed for close-ended campaign play, whereas most campaign rpgs are designed for open ended play.<br/><br/>Is the original rant still accurate though?

I never heard anything at all about Orpheus, and quickly scanning a review over at RPGnet hasn't really helped me understand the qualities you're referring to any better, honestly.<br/><br/>As just a side thing, I should probably mention that I'm more of a film fan than a TV fan, so perhaps that might compare my preferences a bit by citing that.<br/><br/>For example, I'd like games to play a bit like a film that isn't inherently built to have sequels, but you could make some if it really went over well. And I'll give a bit on time length, assuming rpgs just plain  take a bit more time to play ( even easy ones), tha it takes to watch a film. Heck, I'll put it at 3-4 X amount of time of a film.<br/><br/>So, something like, say <i>The Thin Man </i>comes in at about 2 hours. Something similar in an RPG would seem right at 6-8 hours to me. That might make it two sessions of actual play, and I'll even assume a bit of sociallizing on either side of "in-game" play time, so maybe 3 sessions of getting together and 11-12 hours at most.<br/><br/>But I'd only really expect that from truly enthusiastic players-certainly not at the outset. And sequels ( like the follow up Thin Man movies) could be great, but not inherently built as a never ending campaign. More like a revisit to the characters, once again drawn into mystery and boozy hijinks.<br/><br/>As for the original rant? Yeah, most of it still stands. <br/><br/>To clarify the "alpha player" comment: The sheer length of rulebooks ( and here I'm mostly referring to non-dirty-hippy games, although I do think dirty-hippy games are starting to show some signs of this, too, but in a slightly different way) tends to create a situation where a single player almost has to become the go-to guy or gal for the game, and doesn't really encourage other folks to pick up the reigns and run a game ( or even initiate one in the case of GMless or distributed authority ones).<br/><br/>I might be missing some of the newer ones out, but I don't, for example, see a lot of rulesets that are broken up into quikstart packets. Not even in the ones in electronic format, which would seem like an obvious benefit of that medium.<br/><br/>And in this, I don't just mean a chopped down rulesset where everyone is supposed to dig in. I mean something like a one or two sheet thing each, perhaps with different instructions for the GM and players. Maybe the GM packet is as much as 6 pages long. Oh, and a cover page that tells the core set up procedure and backdrop for the event, so people can pick wheteher they want to GM or play a character. Then it's just fill in the blanks and play.<br/><br/>And there might be six or eight or ten of these in the product.<br/><br/>Now, the other goodness I associate with RPGs ( ongoing/return play, really personally customized character creation, character "advancement"/change, creating your own adventure to play, advice on doing all of the above, designer commentary that helps understand the thinking behind the game, advice on folding/spindling/mutilating the core rules and procedures) could all be put somewhere else.

And while I wouldn't call myself a "TV" guy - I don't just sit down and stare at the tube, ever - I have my shows. I loves me my Buffy: the Vampire Slayer, my Lost, and my Heroes (though the last is really starting to suck this season...), and I've watched several of the better anime from beginning to end. I'm a big fan of the new TV, shows written for DVD, not for TV, where they have consistent characters, character development, and long, coherent plots (as opposed to the easily-repeatable formulae of the old TV).<br/><br/>So it's a matter of preference.

One is about long-term play. The main benefit of long-term play for me is emergent properties. In short-term play, even with highly creative and motivated players, I tend not to be too surprised by things that happen.  Certainly I'm never ever surprised by something that I myself do in short-term play.  In long-term games, emergent properties of characters, organizations and situations can create all sorts of surprises for even someone charged with maintaining their continuity (the GM, for example).  That is a great feeling and it never ever happens in less than 5 sessions.<br/><br/>This is separate, though:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>To clarify the "alpha player" comment: The sheer length of rulebooks ( and here I'm mostly referring to non-dirty-hippy games, although I do think dirty-hippy games are starting to show some signs of this, too, but in a slightly different way) tends to create a situation where a single player almost has to become the go-to guy or gal for the game, and doesn't really encourage other folks to pick up the reigns and run a game ( or even initiate one in the case of GMless or distributed authority ones).</blockquote>\nAs an expression of preference and taste, that's cool, but certain people and groups do like this. I am pretty much the gatekeeper for new games for my group. That is a fun thing for me to be.  I read a new game and I go "oh man they are going to LOVE this" and I get to see their faces when I get to the part they are going to love.  They, by contrast, get the benefit of an enthusiastic teacher and advocate for the game, which (by all accounts) they also enjoy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189193/#Comment_189193" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T13:11:50+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  1:11PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To pick up the film/TV metaphor, consider also literature.<br/><br/>In a short story, you get to plot really tightly, do really intense but closely circumscribed character development, and sketch the setting in broad but clear strokes, if you're good. You need to be good; short stories are hard to write.<br/><br/>At novel length, you can plot a bit more leisurely, but you still need a structure, a beginning/middle/end. Your character development can be more in-depth and you can have more contradictions and more change. Your setting can also take on more depth and scope. <br/><br/>In a series of novels, you get the chance to build up a real depth of setting and character - which means your initial concepts need to be such that they can bear some weight. You can have an overarching plot, but usually it's more like reincorporation of elements and exploration of themes. Each individual novel still needs to work in its own right. Often, it's not until the third book that it starts to get really good; often, it's about there that something really significant changes that affects everything from then on. The tone shifts, even. <br/><br/>Eventually, though, if you don't have an overarching plot or some kind of major resolution, these series can degenerate and become weary pastiches of themselves.<br/><br/>I'll leave drawing the parallels with the different lengths of RPG play as an exercise for the reader.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ElectricPaladin" title="ElectricPaladin"><img alt="ElectricPaladin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayStressed.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ElectricPaladin">ElectricPaladin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189197/#Comment_189197" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T13:36:08+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  1:36PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>To pick up the film/TV metaphor, consider also literature...

I hope this is meant as hyperbole.  I mean, granted, the stereotypical gamer is immature, but if you're playing with a group that would behave like this, well, yeah.

They are always incredibly front-loaded with preparation and expectation but then fall apart after a few sessions, if they get even that far (more than once there has been a ton of initial work by all the players, but we never make it to the table).  This has made me very appreciative of pick-up-and-play and short-form games that deliver most of what I am looking for from a roleplaying game, while avoiding these false starts.<br/><br/>It's shame because I really enjoy campaign play, but the reality of it has eluded me since college.  Maybe that's not a coincidence.<br/><br/>While the moving-to-Iceland-on-short-notice example is a little extreme, I also agree with Paul that these kinds of social pressures definitely exist in gaming groups concerning the loss (and addition) of players to a long-term campaign.  But maybe that's a symptom of larger communication problems, like Brian says.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189439/#Comment_189439" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T14:44:24+00:00" title="January 21, 2009  2:44PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely you can over-prepare a long term campaign. I try to aim for 6-9 months in my campaigns and I've experienced overpreparation more than once, normally when I'm really aching to get started and the rest of the players' schedules don't match up.  Right now I try to consciously put aside a game once I reach a certain point of preparation, use player activity and interest to gauge which direction things are going, and when everyone is getting tired and clomping along (4 months or so), I pick out an ending scenario and that gives us the energy we need to drive to and through it.<br/><br/>Handling people coming or not coming explicitly is a big help to any group, long or short-term.<br/><br/>In one game I said "this game is about all four of you, if all four of you aren't here, there is no game" and it worked great.  A few times people fell into the trap of "I can't come, so there's no game, and I feel bad!" I reply: "It is not your fault. I designed this campaign in a particular way, it is my responsibility, not yours."  If someone has to disappear forever, we put the game away and play something else or I do a long-term redesign, but that's pretty rare.<br/><br/>In another game I said "know how when you're in the arcade and you put in a quarter and press 'Player Two Start' and suddenly your guy is there? That's this' and it worked great.<br/><br/>All the conflicts I've ever had about attendance expectations is when nobody said anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189546/#Comment_189546" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T09:04:24+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:04AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder how much of the appeal of long-term campaign play might be the unspoken fear that "if we don't continue the same story with the same characters, what guarantee do I have that anyone will bother to show up next week?" <br/><br/>A <i>lot</i> of gamers I've known -- myself included -- have tended to lack confidence in their own social abilities. For someone like that, it's a lot scarier to say "I like you guys, we should continue hanging out together" than it is to say "Next week we should totally storm that gnoll encampment and get the Mystical MacGuffin back!"<br/><br/>A couple years ago I was a member of two long-term gaming groups. In the first, we all got along fine at the table, cracked jokes together, etc., but none of us <i>ever</i> had the slightest contact with one another outside of game night. That campaign was a classic play-the-same-character-forever game. In the second group, we started off as a bunch of strangers playing a long-term campaign, but we all became friends. As our bonds of friendship grew, the focus on the long-term campaign diminished; we branched off into playing one-shots, trying out new systems, switching up GMs, and, on many occasions, having too much fun just hanging out together eating yummy food and watching bad movies to ever getting around to gaming at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189547/#Comment_189547" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T09:08:36+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:08AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>I wonder how much of the appeal of long-term campaign play might be the unspoken fear that "if we don't continue the same story with the same characters, what guarantee do I have that anyone will bother to show up next week?"</blockquote>\nI don't know, but for the last 10 years or so of <i>my </i>play, the percentage would be exactly zero percent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189552/#Comment_189552" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T09:19:43+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:19AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Damn You Corleeeeeeeyyyyy!!!!</i><br/><br/>Anyway, while I wasn't specifically thinking about the sitch Ron is suggesting, it does seem to play into the whole <i>Campaign play as baseline</i> assumption that was causing me to git itchy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189766/#Comment_189766" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T12:14:02+00:00" title="January 23, 2009 12:14PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>I wonder how much of the appeal of long-term campaign play might be the unspoken fear that "if we don't continue the same story with the same characters, what guarantee do I have that anyone will bother to show up next week?"</blockquote>\nCan't speak for others, but for me like JD zero per cent.<br/><br/>I don't have a social skills problem, nor do many of those I game with, so it's just not an issue.  When I played these sorts of long term campaigns I did so because they have real rewards shorter games don't have.  Now I play shorter games, which have real rewards the longer ones don't have.

But I can't stand Adventure Paths that are somehow some thing we are supposed to follow.  The only thing that matters in gaming is the "Here and Now".  (Another theoretical concept by Moreno who then lent it to Buber).  <br/><br/>I think I understand campaign play versus adventure play as folks have outlined them.  I think it's easier just to call one objective-based and the other open-ended.  That the objective in a finite game is to climb a mountain or examine a social situation like having your car stolen. Open-ended play is a potentially infinite game. The only objective is to play one's role.  Players decide (often in character) on what to just as we decide what we will do in real life. It's just the decision is based on what we know of the game world.  <br/><br/>Why I like potentially never ending games is that a continually growing game world simply gets richer and richer as people play (and really, the only one who needs to consistently be involved in this game world's games is the GM.  Players can come and go enjoying their contributions of success and failure.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189861/#Comment_189861" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T17:01:41+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  5:01PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2009 5:02PM by komradebob.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I also have the attention span of a gnat, which doesn't help either.

If you get to the point where everything is neat and tidy, you should probably stop and start something new.  You have to be open to the possibility of ending or you never will, and it'll just trail off unsatisfactorily as you stop playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>
