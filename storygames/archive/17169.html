Since all my play experience of the AW engine comes from Monsterhearts, that was a heavy influence on my assumptions, but after a few false starts that were more soaperhero than superhero (too much emphasis on the interpersonal relationship of the PCs and NPCs) I went back to basics.<br/><br/>First of all, I asked myself what I'd want to do in a supers games and the immediate answer was, "Use my super powers!" That suggested taking an approach more like Dungeon World, which is an adventure with characters rather than character driven adventure. So, I wanted a base set of moves that were vehicles for using powers: fighting bad guys, saving victims, the whole cliche.<br/><br/>The very next stumbling block I hit was coming up with a set of moves and stats that zipped together neatly: lots of stats suggested themselves, like strength, speed and agility or truth, mercy and justice, but none of them really seemed to suit the moves I wanted exactly, being either too restrictive or too vague. That produced my real light bulb moment: what if I didn't have stats? All the heroes would be doing pretty much the same things, the differnces between them would come largely from their superpowers, so why not say that a basic move was just 'roll' rather than 'roll+stat'? That immediately suggested a basic model for the superpwer moves, that they enable you to roll+something, which in turn suggested a resource called 'power.' The more power you had, the higher your superpower rolls would be!<br/><br/>The power resource quickly became the backbone of the game: backstory choices, like those for the skins in Monsterhearts, provide ways to gain power; special moves are mostly 'roll+power' or 'spend 1 power'; power also replaces experience, so that you when you acquire 5 power, you spend it and get an advance!<br/><br/>There are also some theatrics about the hack that I really like: each hero is based on a 'costume' which is based on two mini-playbooks. One, the origin, gives you the first part of your hero name and a choice of motifs; the other, style, gives you the second part of the name and a choice of colours. So, Captain Frost is a made-in-a-lab type hero with icy powers, who carries a distinctive shield to match his light and dark blue costume, while Doctor Frost is a magician-type, whose costume is a hooded white &amp; silver cloak. The origins and styles alone give 64 basic costumes, but the backstory and special move choices extend the range much further.<br/><br/>A fairly rough draft of the game as it stands is available on my website now: it's called <a href="http://www.groundhoggoth.co.uk/images/stories/games/jh_vanilla.pdf" rel="nofollow">Just Heroes</a> and I'm interested in getting feedback.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389453/#Comment_389453" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-06T15:37:38+00:00" title="September  6, 2012  3:37PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you going to write a post-modern sequel later, called UnJust Heroes?

It's like a Danger Patrol approach to *W. When I read your description of it, I kinda had my doubts, but now I'm not sure there's a better approach for supers. Unlike many other genres with iconic archetypes, a superhero's origins and motivations usually don't have any special connection to what it is they can actually <i>do</i>. The only way I could see doing it more as a single-playbook thing is if you were to severely curtail the archetypes you want to include (and make a number of decisions about them for the player, which might not always be cool), or to limit things to a street-level game, with a much lower variety of powers and origins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389665/#Comment_389665" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T02:39:35+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  2:39AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still juggling elements of this hack: its a work-in-progress, not a finished game, so a lot of factors are undecided, or the decisions mad change on a daily basis. I started with the assumption that heroes start with zero power, but in the most recent draft, I've changed that 1 power; also, though you advance when you have 5 power, it only costs you 4, so your hero still has 1 power after gaining their advance, which means getting to benefit from it right away.<br/><br/>I've also made a couple of 'complete costumes', one page versions of the playbooks that have an origin and style which are linked together: these are the 'Dark Avenger', a street-level, Punisher-type character, and the 'Gadgeteer', an inventor who can use moves from any style by building a gadget or gizmo which does that. The next draft on the site should reflecct all these changes together, plus some detail on the MCs agendas and principles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Redismyname" title="Redismyname"><img alt="Redismyname" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Redismyname">Redismyname</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403962/#Comment_403962" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-18T00:06:16+00:00" title="January 18, 2013 12:06AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'd be nice to just plug and play the powers.

Just about anyone who takes Flight as a power immediately has an advantage over him, so how do you keep Spider-man's intrinsic value without toppling the system? <br/><br/>I actually like the idea that making the superhero of your choice is a challenge, so instead of making a clear template for any hero (well, apart from Superman, who is clearly [-]+[superlative]) I've mixed cool powers from a variety fo heroes together in most of the style-books.

Exciting. Came across this doing a search for superheroes. Would you believe me if I said I had a similar idea of making superheroes out of origins + powers (inspired by Danger Patrol) but never got further than writing down a couple lists of origins and powers? So I think it's brilliant! Although my tastes run to postmodern Watchmenesque supers, I think I'll try talking my group into using this as a starting point (plus McDaldno's AW core stuff) now that we've given up on trying to do superheroes with Sorcerer. Wish me luck on the sell.<br/><br/>And ... almost every hero archetype I want to do is represented here. I thought it was missing the super-soldier / ninja, but the Avenger half of Dark Avenger is that. <br/><br/>About the only thing from my lists that doens't seem to be represented here is some kind of "Elemental" origin - which could be for Iceman, any of the Fantastic Four, even Swamp Thing. (An 'earth elemental' or 'plant elemental' they sometimes call him in Moore's comics.) - We've got a plant lady in our game that might use that. Other characters in our game are already represented - we've got a Dr. Shadow, an [Alien] [Superlative], and a Metal (more-or-less) Claw or Avenger.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a name for the alien, how about Visitor? Or Stranger? (Or, actually Alien is fine too.)<br/><br/>If you're looking for a name for the [superlative], how about Paragon?<br/><br/>How would you do Hulk / Thing? Are they simply [superlative], or should there be a Brute power? <br/><br/>Are there any rules for heroes like Hulk, Captain Marvel, Iron Man - where they're squishy mortals unless [trigger event here]? (Sorry if it's there and I just missed it because of skimming.)<br/><br/>Side note: one of the reasons I think it's brilliant was because of something I once heard J. Walton say about superhero games - it's really easy to make a goofy non-archetype superhero in most superhero games, that has nowhere near the resonance of a AAA superhero. By making it playbooks, I think you capture the essence of those popular superheroes which will let people do iconic superheroes without screwing it up and making silly things like "Cactus Man" (I'm looking at you, *Icons*). <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412003/#Comment_412003" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-14T17:47:03+00:00" title="April 14, 2013  5:47PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cactus man sounds wicked cool.

It's also worth noting how the iconicness (yeah, i'm cool with making up words) of superheroes has led so many minds, including my own, in the same direction in regards to an AW supers hack; frex, yeah, you'll see that I've renamed all the Style books and the [superlative] is now... the Paragon! I almost feel like this is one of the those games that already exists in potential and I'm just carving it out into reality... my gosh, that was pretentious, wasn't it?<br/><br/>The suggestion of a trigger-type super is interesting... it feels like that could be a move, rather than the base for an Origin or Style, but then it's also something which is implicit in the current structure of the game, where one of the basic moves, <b>fight foes</b>, can <i>only</i> be done by using a style move: in other words, the only way the characters can even get into a fight is to use their superpowers. There may be more mileage to be obtained from that idea, especially if paired with the Origin questions: like, <i>how do you change to your super identity?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412071/#Comment_412071" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-15T15:45:33+00:00" title="April 15, 2013  3:45PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Hulk is mostly a Mr. Paragon, I think.

They are both just billionaires making toys and then using that to fight crime. In that, you could merge The Suit and the Gadgeteer. At that point, they start off the same, but can advance their character in one of two ways .... toward making a suit OR toward making gadgets.<br/><br/>I think that would be a much more interesting character creation process. Merging down your characters to only 8-10 playbooks at max and then having those split into 2 near opposite extensions of the first half of the playbook,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412536/#Comment_412536" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T08:46:38+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  8:46AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Feedback for James! (Sent originally to him, he asked me to post it here so others could discuss.)<br/><br/>Played a one-shot of Just Heroes last night. Three of us really dug it with some reservations, one of us not so much. That's better odds than I've gotten with Monsterhearts, so take heart. I like the mix-and-match playbooks, I like the way moves get colored, I like the way weaknesses are built into the origins (the Suit should be able to have problems with alcoholism, though), and our superhero tale was a good popcorn action romp with some tender moments, tough choices, and dark portents. Captain Flicker, secret government speedster on a tight leash who longed to be free, was a great character, as was Girl Winter, 15 year old ice-powered crimefighter in powder-blue and pink ... and Flicker's sidekick. <br/><br/>We played it pretty much as written, traits and all. One hack I did was I cut the complete costumes in half because I thought somebody might want to play an Avenging Shadow or a Project Gun-guy but nobody ended up using them anyway. <br/><br/>Big pile of negative but hopefully constructive criticism follows - don't you dare think this means you should give up on the game - I'd rather you publish it as is than think that.<br/><br/>We intended to play it four-color silver age, but it didn't quite feel that way in the end. Sev thinks because it's built on Apocalypse World - Apocalypse World, with all its mixed results and failed rolls, is a great system for gritty bad shit happening and heroes who fail their way to eventual pyrrhic victory ... and that's what we ended up seeing. Part of it may be my style as a GM and reader of comic books, but I think part of it is just the AWness. I'd put bystanders in danger and then the heroes would flub their rolls so I'd hurt the bystanders as established ... (as the woman Girl Winter failed to save was carted away in an ambulance, Girl Winter cried a single ice tear that sparkled in the moonlight before it shattered on the pavement...)<br/><br/>So, something to think about - there's a bunch of silver age games out there. Marvel old &amp; new, With Great Power, Capes, etc. There really isn't a Dark Postmodern Superhero game to do that Dark Knight / Watchmen / Miracleman / Powers stuff that I dig. 'Just Heroes' could be that game - it's already most of the way there because of the mixed results and hard moves carrying over from AW / Monsterhearts. Maybe all it needs is a set of appropriate GM principles...one might be "Barf Forth Harsh Consequences"...another might be "Make Superheroes Seem Real"...<br/><br/>Maybe you just haven't read enough dark postmodern superhero comics! If you haven't read Dark Knight, Watchmen, Powers, and Alan Moore's run on Swamp Thing you really gotta. Bendis's run on Daredevil - where Daredevil gets outed - is great too. Morrison's run on Doom Patrol was pretty great. Miracleman is awesome but hard to find. Invincible is solid.<br/><br/>Other feedback:<br/><br/>In the absence of GM guidance I came up with my own set of GM moves and some advice to myself about the first scene: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLEhMicTttGqPNUWwwHRqeaSRheWpu8mk-kVfpgdNNU/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLEhMicTttGqPNUWwwHRqeaSRheWpu8mk-kVfpgdNNU/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>The biggest sticking point for us was Jay Loomis and his character. A lot of things that might have been a basic move in another game we weren't sure how to handle here. Mr. Meson, not in costume, didn't want to give away his secret identity to his sister and hopeful future girlfriend, so he tried talking down a couple muggers instead of fighting. What move to use there? Seek Aid isn't quite right. We went with Stand Firm. Mr. Meson, a Pulse with physics-forces instead of lightning color, had Force Field, and wanted to use it to stop an escaping car. "But that's for saving bystanders" I said. "But I can obviously do it in the fiction." Again, went with Stand Firm. (Maybe Stand Firm is the fallback Coolness Under Fire equivalent of this game...) Then Mr. Meson wanted to rip the car door off. "But you don't have super strength. That's for Paragon." "But I'm still strong, right? Like, not Superman strong, but Cyclops strong." "Okay - sure - you're strong in the fiction, but don't get the +2 to save bystanders that a paragon does. So. Sure. You rip the door off." Mr. Meson also wanted to fly, but didn't have Flight, so we said he could make big powered jumps. In general, I think Jay felt not-as-super as he hoped to feel, and it turned him off the game. I don't think it means the game is broken, I think it just means some tweaking. I think heroes should probably start with three moves and be allowed to pick at least one of them off a different sheet. I think before play you should talk about what your power is in the fiction, with the general rule that "If the power isn't already a move you can buy, you can just have it, but it doesn't give you any mechanical bonuses."<br/><br/>We didn't know what Harm &amp; Stealing Yourself meant in the fiction. "So, I've just been shot, and I took harm. Does that mean I'm bleeding? Then I steel myself and I'm fine? So I guess I'm not bleeding, but what does it mean, then?"<br/><br/>Another thing - and I think there's a thread on Story Games about this somewhere - is that letting you spend fate points on either influencing the rolls or XP is awkward. That's the sort of cool meaningful choice I like when playing a board game but not an RPG. The players hoarded their power for advances and generally seemed less super as a result - and part of why our game may have seemed gritty and high in collateral damage. <br/><br/>Some of the not-quite-as-super-as-we-expected also might not have been knowing the system. I like the "Use power, you might accidentally kill someone" rule for Fight Foes, but that meant Sev backed off of beating down some villains, missed the roll, and so I said a bystander got shot and was bleeding out. In hindsight we probably would have used Save Bystanders.<br/><br/>25 power for an advance? (I didn't realize that you could still get XP the old-fashioned way, by using your highlighted stat, here.) That's pretty expensive. With MH and AW people are getting advances all the time; nobody got close to an advance in our session, and they were taking power like candy every chance they could. (Another great moment - Winter Girl failed an internal monologue. So I thought about what to hit her with, and saw she had 'take 1 power when you lie to an adult' so I had the hurt woman say, "I'm not going to make it, am I? I'm  dying here."  Winter Girl: "No, no! You'll be fine. You'll be okay." "Are you lying?" I asked. "Probably," she said. So I tossed her a power token.) This might be fixed by separating XP from Power.<br/><br/>Captain Flicker beat down a group of mercenaries and I wasn't sure how much harm they should be able to take. So guidelines on how much harm a single civilian can withstand would be cool. In hindsight, I think they should have been a small or medium gang but I didn't have my AW book handy. I'd like to see a simplified verison of the AW gang rules built into Just Heroes.<br/><br/>Don't know how I feel about the Style having a specific stat for Fight Foes, which seems like one of the most important moves (though we really didn't use it that much) - seems like it would encourage munchkining. "Don't play a Kid Titan, you'll suck!" Wouldn't be a problem with most of the players I usually play with though.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem like there's that much juice in the "I like X because..." bonds. I tried to bring some more into it by then turning to X and saying, "When did they see you be secretive (or whatever)?" and then turning back and asking, "And why do you (not) like that?" It's probably fine for silver age popcorn movie adventure, though. Just not enough for Watchmen.<br/><br/><br/>Anyhow, thanks so much for a fun evening and making this game so I didn't have to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412553/#Comment_412553" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T11:09:36+00:00" title="April 24, 2013 11:09AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>And here's the response I sent to JD for his creative and constructive feedback:</i><br/><br/>I'm glad you got a chance to play it and have some fun with it! The feedback is also very useful and chimes in with some of the things i have been thinking.<br/><br/>You're right about the AWness bleeding through into the style of game: to a certain extent, the power points are intended to offset that, allowing players to spend points to get the additional levels of success they really need, but making it more intentionally Watchmen-like is tempting.... yeah, I'm probably going to do that, which also clears up a number of other issues. (Thinking on that now: you could actually flavour the game very easily by having different consequences for the moves in different comic book eras... a sort of easy plug and play to create the style and tone your group wants.)<br/><br/>I've been planning to replace <b>seek aid</b> with a more simple and direct persuasion-like move: the only thing that's been holding me back from this is that I can't think what to call it!<br/><br/>I've also been wondering just how broad to make the style moves: the trademark of AW is to have very focused, precise moves that do exactly what they say on the page, but as you noticed in your session, there are obvious consequences of some powers, e.g. if you have a Force Field that can <b>save bystanders</b>, then why can't you use it to stop a car? I guess you can just say "Your power doesn't work like that," but as noted, that makes the heroes feel less powerful than they should be. I've been really tempted to double the number of moves in each style and start PCs with more of them, but I'm not sure that really solves the problem, just reduces the number of situations where it occurs. There are two other ways I could tackle it:<br/> - <b>Spend Power:</b> players could spend power to use a move they don't have... only that's kind of like what they can already spend power to do, in most situations, e.g. the Force Field gives a +2 bonus to save bystanders but you want to use it in place of stand firm to stop the foes from escaping. Is it worth having a rule that says 'Spend 1 power to use a style move you have in an different way' or should I expand upon the idea of spending power 1-for-1 for +1 to any move? Should I make players justify how they spend their points? E.g. "I'm spending 2 power for +2 to this <b>stand firm</b> roll, because I'm using my Force Field."<br/> - <b>Create the World:</b> alternatively, as part of setting up the game, is it worth having a talk about the expectations of play? For example, supers could just be naturally stronger, faster, tougher, etc, than ordinary humans and so can bring that into the fiction when required, but it doesn't give them a mechanical bonus. This is sort of like the questions that come up about playbooks in MH, like what happens to vampires in sunlight and can ghosts be seen by everybody or just the select few?<br/>Harm is still one of the areas I need to look at: I really like the idea of the heroes trading building-demolishing blows with the villains and then shrugging it off, but yeah, it maybe needs to be called something other than 'harm' and described in such a way. One thought is that it doesn't really become actual harm until the end of the scene you're in, but that feels a bit vague for an AW based game.<br/><br/>I <i>definitely</i> need to clarify the XP and Advancement rules: it's still 5XP to advance and you still mark experience when you roll your highlighted stat. The 'Spend 5 power to mark experience' rule is an optional extra, but I'll drop that if it's encouraging players to hoard their power rather than spend it.<br/><br/>The other bits you mentioned (harm for bystanders, gangs, <b>fight foes</b> and the character traits with likes &amp; dislikes) are all very much part of the 'work-in-progress': I'm still wrestling with all of these to get them into a form I like, with the whole business of fighting foes being the biggest headache. It's a knotty problem to unravel: for example, if Superman every fought Lex Luthor, Lex would be mincemeat in a split second, but the fiction stops that from happening: so how do you stop the PCs from just going out and pasting their biggest foes? Using the fiction and the rules to stop them makes it a silver age game... on the other hand, if you don't stop them, it soon degenerates into a vigilante game where the heroes are constantly on the run from the authorities, all the time. I don't mind if the heroes are fallible, but I don't want to give them the option to become villains as a more effective way of upholding justice.<br/><br/>You are totally right about the munchkinism: I've been trying to ignore that problem, but it needs addressing, so <b>fight foes</b> will probably be reinstated as a basic move, with the style moves giving PCs special options to use with that move, like tags, etc.<br/><br/>Thanks once again for playing the game: the feedback you gave is exactly the sort needed to get it into shape and focus it on what it should be about.

For example, one person might see Batman as the Gadgeteer, whereas to another he might best be emulated by the Adept+Shadow combo, or even the Dark Avenger. No choice is ever going to be perfect, however, and I've got no interest in trying to nail down every possibility represented by every superbeing ever to appear in any medium, so I'm happy if the process of choosing an Origin and Style leaves some questions unanswered. As I've recently been reminded, one of the principles of AW is to find out through play: a lot of the design problems I've had with this hack stem from trying to make a Silver Age-style setting fit into a  Dark Age-style system. I think if I can get the basics right, then the fiction should follow honestly from the principles, without needing to be pre-loaded with instructions on how the game 'should' be played.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the grindstone. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412605/#Comment_412605" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-24T19:08:56+00:00" title="April 24, 2013  7:08PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2013 7:17PM by jdfristrom.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally groove on the idea of Superman killing Lex Luthor, btw. Old-school superhero comics don't let anybody die or the status quo to change in any way - more modern comics are less afraid of change. Kind of like TV.<br/><br/>Maybe there's another possible principle in there for a postmodern superhero game - something like "If the status quo gets broken, let it stay broken" or "There is no status quo" The supervillain stays dead, the superhero whose secret identity has been compromised stays outed...<br/><br/>(For a set of principles for silver age you might be able to just copy the old Comics Code...I think Capes did something like that.)<br/><br/>Of your two choices, I prefer Create The World I think. If the players want real super supers maybe you start them out with free advances.<br/><br/>On the harm front, maybe a move like this:<br/>When your character is <b>harmed</b>, mark harm, and tell us how and what that means for your character, knowing that the harm may be temporary if you Steel Yourself.<br/><br/>This way the player playing a Batman type could say "I took a bullet in the shoulder. I'm bleeding." where the player playing Superman could say something like "They must have kryptonite bullets" or "A building fell on me."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448834/#Comment_448834" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-30T18:55:01+00:00" title="September 30, 2015  6:55PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.
