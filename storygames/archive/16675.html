You see, I am moving to Raleigh, NC in July, to take a library position at North Carolina State University.  I am leaving behind an amazing group of Story Gamers in Madison, and am hoping to find a similar scene in the area.  I am willing to play, run, meet up, etc.  I would be willing to run numerous things, but have a hankering to run Apocalypse World.  Besides that, are there any other ways to get involved in the Story Games scene in the Triangle?  Also, feel free to move this discussion if it is not in the right place!<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch appreciated, and thank you for this wonderful site, it has been reinvigorating my love of role playing for the past two years!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381343/#Comment_381343" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T20:51:12+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  8:51PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Kate.

Recently played Archipelago II, Into the Odd, Prime Time Adventures, and a bunch of other stuff.<br/><br/>Looks like a few story-gaming types will be attending the Escapist Expo in Raleigh this September, so there's bound to be some gaming there.

The closest you'll find to State Street is Fayateville St in Raleigh or Franklin St in Chapel Hill (or 9th Street in Durham, but only in as much as restaurants). It's like instead of one big city there's three smaller ones that orbit each other.<br/><br/>Also, if gaming is your Thing, and you haven't locked in a house/apt yet, you'll probably want to live closer towards the left side of Raleigh, or way up north off of I-540, to get you better access to Durham/Cary/etc. But there are all sorts of cool places in downtown Raleigh to live, too. <br/><br/>Plus, if you like beer, the Flying Saucer is awesome.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381376/#Comment_381376" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T03:38:24+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  3:38AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Kate, and welcome!

Eric, the organizaer, is super-active and -dedicated; and he's got the story/indie games bug.

Although, when I tried to run a Story Games Night there, I got the distinct imprression that the owner wasn't keen on tables being taken up for games he doesn't (can't?) sell. I tried to make a  point of buying some thing or another each night, but that's not really sustainable long-term (unless I indulge my Clix habit again). Perhaps he's changed his mind, in the past year--I haven't been there in a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381398/#Comment_381398" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T07:19:53+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  7:19AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Hi!

It's been too long, Dave!<br/><br/>Indeed, the Raleigh Tabletop RPG Meetup's organizer Eric and his wife are awesome, AWESOME human beings who have dedicated some serious time and money to make sure that gamers in the triangle have a table. 95% of the group doesn't play story games (not that they're not receptive, though; I've gotten some bites, and there actually is a huge 3:16 fanbase here which surprised me!), but Eric and some others are extremely interested in them.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381402/#Comment_381402" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T07:39:44+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  7:39AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome to the area.

I think it it also makes it easy for me to get to many places in the city.  <br/><br/>I joined the meet up mentioned (though it did seem to lean heavily to the Pathfinder side of things, but I did see some stuff about Dread, so yay to that!), and will post, when it gets closer on the list serve, and keep my eyes open for NC Game days and the upcoming cons.  <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Jason">@Jason</a>: I will be working at D.H Hill at the beginning, in User Experiences (basically, reference, instruction, assessment, tiny bit of web design).  I am one of the new "fellows" there: basically people who are chosen right out of grad school to take semi leadership positions.  My scene in Madison has been based around UW Madison's SLIS (school of library and Info Science) and people I met through Epic (a big health software company just outside of Madison).  It was actually my husband and I who started to introduce people to these games (we actually first became good friends playing Lacuna in College), as most of them had been gaming for a while but mostly in D&amp;D, WoD, and Shadowrun.  So, its kind of isolated from any main gaming scene in Madison, but it is great.  A good group of people who are always interested in trying new things.  They even are willing to jump in when I say that I want to run a one off about dying for your belief by the Inquisition (Montsegur 1244).  Recently I ran a game of In a Wicked Age, and we have been involved in a long running game of Burning Wheel (going on 2 years now I think).  The one main problem with the group is that not a huge amount of people are willing to GM.<br/><br/>Looking forward to meeting and gaming with you all, whee, so excited <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381925/#Comment_381925" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T16:16:21+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  4:16PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you are Our People!<br/><br/>You'll have the opposite problem here - everybody is a GM.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381926/#Comment_381926" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T16:18:49+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  4:18PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You'll have the opposite problem here - everybody is a <del>GM</del> game designer.</blockquote>Fixed that for you....<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384396/#Comment_384396" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-05T22:14:48+00:00" title="July  5, 2012 10:14PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in Durham.

I hate driving into, out of, and within Charlotte. Oh well. The place it is at isn't too bad to get to, and there's eats within walking distance of the hotel (Smokey Bones, Chick-fil-A, Sushi 101). Also, for those who would appreciate such, the area has this kick ass playground for the youngins to burn off some energy.<br/><br/>BTW- I'm Carl Little, near Greensboro. Been running I guess they would be called traditional/mainstream RPG's at MACE for years now, also some LARP's.

I think 1984? 1983? I had to be dropped off, and I was playing Champions at the time, so... yeah, let's say '84. It was that con or the one next year that first exposed me to boffer fighting (as a cheap alternative to SCA) and, well, <a href="http://glasscutters.org/GLASS.pdf" rel="nofollow">I've never really lost THAT bug</a>. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Hopefully, SC can actually be gamers-welcome! There was a time, back before it dried up as an event earlier this decade, when the "lit and art folks" seemed to sort of resent the "take over" by gamers. I'd heard grumbling from the greybeards who started it in the 70s (some of whom are associated with UNCG's liberal arts departments). I think they wanted it to stay more broad-spectrum/fandom...?<br/><br/>Oh, and it would be totally sweet if it came back to the Student Union!
