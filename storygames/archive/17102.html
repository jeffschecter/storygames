(Speaking of the price, while it was $150, that also got you <i>two </i>GM badges, and previously purchased general admission badges were refunded.)<br/><br/>Since I have two games in the pipeline to come out in the near future, playtesting is valuable to me for getting to fine-tune things, but I also took advantage of the marketing and focus group aspect of the track, just as I did with Metatopia last year for <i>House of Cards</i>. As I understand it, Vinny has said that he wants to create a year-long development track across multiple shows: First Exposure would fit into that as the "sneak peek" portion, heavy on workshopping. It would be preceded by some as-yet nebulous events, and then capped by Metatopia as the final dry run and debut event. I'd spin that yearly cycle around, personally, since the size of the audience at Gen Con makes it the most appropriate for "initial public offering" of games that have already spent a year building buzz.<br/><br/>But, yeah: I'm 100% behind the idea.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388413/#Comment_388413" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T09:30:38+00:00" title="August 27, 2012  9:30AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2012 9:31AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They had the most beautiful space - a massive hall with sky-high ceilings.
