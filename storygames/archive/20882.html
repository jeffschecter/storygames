Perhaps one could start by placing some well know games on a scale of one to ten, by consensus, and the building the list from that starting point.

This doesn't have to mean that it's ill-defined, though; one could simply decide that "low crunch" means that a game has none of the different categories of complexity, and "high crunch" means that it is very involved in at least some categories. So both <i>Universalis</i> (high points of contact, low reference density) and 4th edition D&amp;D (vice versa) would rank high on "crunchiness" for different reasons, which I think matches the way the concept is usually used. In my experience crunchiness is only ever discussed in contrast to simple games, so as long as you capture <i>that</i> idea, it doesn't really matter what the specific nature of the crunch is. A person just wants to have a game that doesn't require them to read a long rulebook and care about the rules too much!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458434/#Comment_458434" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-30T06:26:57+00:00" title="November 30, 2016  6:26AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2016 6:28AM by Rickard.">edited November 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Even the word "crunchiness" is ill-defined. /.../ Is D&amp;D 4e, with its unified mechanics and design-by-exception over dozens of different classes crunchier than Pathfinder, or not?</blockquote>\nIf I'm purely guessing, "crunch" was defined by exemplify from D&amp;D, and going outside the example makes the word itself hard to understand.

I find myself having less and less time with the responsibilities of adulthood and having to  balance whether the time commitment to learning a game is worth it to play it. It's one of the factors I have to consider when thinking about what games to play.   If a game takes a long time to learn and is super crunchy and rule heavy, I better like it a lot if I'm going to learn it.  I see a list like this, that is a "crunchy" list, as a means to help adults with not much time assess whether or not they want to invest time into a game.  By giving them the relative "crunchiness" of the game they can decide if they think the time investment is worth it... I thought a lot of people would be in my shoes and that something of this nature would be useful to them, but if it doesn't seem like something useful to others than it really wouldn't be worth putting together. I thought of it more of a practical exercise than an academic one; it wouldn't have to be called "crunchiness" necessarily, it could be called "time commitment and rule complexity" instead. Anyway, I'm   always dealing with time management when gaming and thought others might be as well <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thanks <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458444/#Comment_458444" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-30T15:05:33+00:00" title="November 30, 2016  3:05PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally understand the desire for a metric of "how hard is this game to learn?" but it's not straightforward. <br/><br/>I mean, D&amp;D 4E has a huuuuge list of feats and powers and stuff to pore over, but to actually play it, you basically just roll a d20, add a modifier from your character sheet, and compare it to a target number that's either a defense for a monster or a target number assigned by the GM.  And if you don't like the result, you can spend an action point and try again.  You can take a pregen character and be playing D&amp;D 4E in like 10 minutes.   That's less time than it would take me to explain Fate Accelerated to someone who knows nothing about Fate - because while "roll 4DF and add a modifier" is straightforward, there are way more options on actions because of Aspects.  But D&amp;D4 is generally regarded as much more crunchy than FAE.<br/><br/>So how do you rate this stuff?  Is it "how much reading does someone need to do to GM this?" (The One Ring is suddenly very high on this scale) or "How many character creation choices do you have?" (D&amp;D4 and Pathfinder go through the roof) or "How complicated is the resolution process?" (Houses of the Blooded/World of Dew are super complex!) or "How hard is this game to wrap your head around?" (Chuubo's!) or ... what? There are so many different factors, and it's hard to tell which ones will be relevant for different people.<br/><br/>So I'm totally on board with your goal, but I have no idea how to get there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458445/#Comment_458445" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-30T15:27:27+00:00" title="November 30, 2016  3:27PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How many hours of prep are required to learn the game to GM it?<br/>How many hours of prep are required to GM the first session?<br/>How many hours of prep are required to GM the second and subsequent sessions?<br/>How many hours of prep are required to play the first session (chargen, etc.)?<br/>How many hours of prep are required to play the second and subsequent sessions?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458446/#Comment_458446" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-30T16:19:19+00:00" title="November 30, 2016  4:19PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best resource I'm aware at the moment is:<br/><a href="http://fictioneers.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fictioneers.net/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458448/#Comment_458448" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-30T17:55:03+00:00" title="November 30, 2016  5:55PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 for Fictioneers for this!

The players, however, need to know how the mechanics work to play (they're simple, sure, but it wouldn't be hard to imagine a much 'crunchier' version of The Pool, where the player-side are rules are significantly more complex).<br/><br/><i>Kagematsu</i> is also an interesting example, since the players must know the mechanical options at their disposal to play at all, but Kagematsu's role (as quasi-GM) is very simple from a "crunch" standpoint - essentially just "frame a scene, play your character, and choose Love or Pity at the end of the scene".<br/><br/>So, another important factor here is: how much of the mechanics and procedures of play have to be internalized before you start playing? (How much of the book/text/materials do you need to know to play?)<br/><br/>To play Chess, you need to know how each piece moves from the beginning. In Magic: The Gathering, you can put off learning what a card does until it's in your hand.<br/><br/>There are also games with very simple rules but great nuances in application (e.g. <i>Fiasco</i> or <i>Dog Eat Dog</i>). When I've tried to play <i>Fiasco</i> with a group of people who were all unfamiliar with the game, we crashed and burned almost immediately. On the other hand, a group of people who really "get" how that kind of gaming goes can get a bunch of the rules wrong and still play very successfully (e.g. the Tabletop Fiasco episode).<br/><br/>I've realized that one of the reasons I've played a lot of my game <i>Musette</i> with people (particularly non-gamers) is because of the way it's easy to explain one rule at a time - basically, you can explain it once you get there in play. That adds a lot to accessibility. It's not my favourite game to play, but it's so easy for me to introduce and play reliably, that it ends up on the table often.<br/><br/>If I were to make some kind of "objective" metric for this, I'd want to measure how long it takes a person to be prepared to start playing (if this is necessary - e.g. reading books), and measure how long it takes to explain all the rules to a group sitting down with the game for the first time. Much like Adam's suggestion. That's the only way I can imagine being somewhat objective about it. ("We decided to play Game X. We read and/or explained and then created characters. That took two hours. Then we were ready to play.")<br/><br/>As far as a subjective metric goes, I found the ratings on Fictioneers to be pretty intuitive, despite all these problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458469/#Comment_458469" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-01T15:49:40+00:00" title="December  1, 2016  3:49PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FYI y'all -- An account at Fictioneers.net is free, and once you've registered, you can enter games into the database.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458479/#Comment_458479" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-01T19:59:45+00:00" title="December  1, 2016  7:59PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>FYI y'all -- An account at Fictioneers.net is free, and once you've registered, you can enter games into the database.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThis could be a good solution.
