I don't think I'm the only one either, as Chris was yearning for the same thing in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2978&amp;page=1#Item_2" rel="nofollow">Most Wanted Settings</a> thread. <br/><br/>And I'm not talking a modern fantasy as we convention normally has it, whereby fantasy elements are grafted onto our own world (a la Urban Arcana, Shadowrun, Neverwhere, Harry Potter) but a fantasy world advanced into a modern age akin to our own.<br/><br/>So what would such a world look like? What would the Forgotten Realms or Dragonlance or Greyhawk look like in a thousand years time, after their own industrial revolutions? I'm not really looking for specifics for those worlds, but if you wanna chuck something in that's cool too.<br/><br/>So here's what I've come up with, as a random spool of ideas that might one day go into making a consistent whole:<br/><br/>*a cold war between two rival theocratic superpowers, perhaps one of them made up of Drow in the Underdark, another made up of LG paladins.<br/><br/>*a global ban on SMDs - spells of mass destruction. All Class (read, level) 9 spells are banned by international treaty, and any country found possessing or using them is in violation and is punished. Maybe by wish.<br/><br/>*the Imperial Age has ended, in which the old empires colonised other planes of existence. Those colonies still exist there, perhaps connected by decaying portals and comprising an interplanar commonwealth.<br/><br/>*many magic items are now produced on an industrial scale, so you have gun-like magic wands.<br/><br/>*vehicles contain bound elementals as power sources.<br/><br/>*a great ethereal web of bound spirits and demons exists that everyday folk can tap into to communicate or research stuff.<br/><br/>*the police make use of diviners, coroners use speak with dead and the justice system is all about the geas.<br/><br/>*planar/international travel is accomplished by private portals/plane shifts/teleportation, if you have the money. If not, you have to take the elemental-train through a great planar tunnel. Like the Channel Tunnel, but to the Abyss and back.<br/><br/>*all this interplanar summoning and travel has a detrimental effect, and the world is warming as a result of planar magic, possibly causing the barriers between the planes to break down and the elemental planes to leak in.<br/><br/>So, how else might a modern fantasy world look? And what system would you use to play in it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67856/#Comment_67856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T09:46:01+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  9:46AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew,<br/><br/>This is exactly what I was working on with a thing I ended up calling Urban Mythos about 7-8 years ago.<br/><br/>There's still a rather shit website up for it at urbanmythos.com I think.  Although it seems to be blocked by the proxy here for some reason.<br/><br/>Anyway, short version off the top of my head:<br/><br/>Setting is a very close analogue of the real world.  Magic is not only real, but pretty well understood and actually a little passe.  Somewhat analogous to the way computers were in about 1990: Yeah, magic, I don't see what use it is to me?  Magic is complicated and pretty much anything it can be used for has been duplicated by technology.  Learning to cast spells like Ignite is bloody hard work.  Buying a box of matches is easy and cheap.  But there are nerdy magic-obsessed people and hobbyists who like to do things the old fashioned way.<br/><br/>Magic has always been there, but has largely be replaced in the industrial revolution.  You can teach someone to cast a missile spell in a couple of years or give them a longbow and train them to use it in a couple of months.<br/><br/>It had quite a neat system using tarot cards.<br/><br/>There was a lot of stuff about the other races.  I'll have to see if I can dig up some notes later.  They were all along the lines of Urban Fantasy rather than D&amp;D style things though.  More Mieville than Tolkien.  The interesting one was the Vampires, who are misunderstood by most people, in the same way that most people in the UK know very little about Orthodox Jews for example.  They're not scary to the average person in the street, just a bit odd.  But that average person really has other things to worry about, they simply aren't interested in learning about the ins and outs of vampires because, hey, live and let live, they aren't hurting anyone.<br/><br/>There was a lot of moral ambiguity in the setting.  It was a very "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Wands of +2 Fireball"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67872/#Comment_67872" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T10:08:42+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 10:08AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2007 10:10AM by Vaxalon.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a number of settings that have attempted this feat, that is, to base an industrial revolution on systematized magic.<br/><br/>Eberron is one of them.

Whole corporations of wizards working for decades to create spells that could potentially unravel the whole fabric of reality... or create a cleaner burning magical fuel.<br/><br/>*Magitocracies (and lots of them) - Given the general level of apathy among people, those motivated to dedicate their life to magic wield almost unstoppable levels of power. What this means is that almost all positions of influence and power in the world are held by cut-throat politican wizards who aren't afraid to engage in magical duels on the Senate floor. "Normal" or "non-magical" people are maginalized and probably heavily discriminated against.<br/><br/>*The Magic Gap - Older countries with established wizarding colleges have entered into an ever widening 'magic gap' with the rest of the world. While in the 'first world' you will see utopian floating cities complete with ressurection hospitals and recreational 'feather falls' off of a small tower... in the 'third world' people live in constant fear of their life as otherworldly horrors and unstable reality (the byproducts of 'civilized magic') claim more lives every year.<br/><br/>*The Super Virus - All this healing and ressurection magic has got to provoke some sort of response from the Death Plane... possible in the form of a magical plague so virulent that modern magic is completely unable to stop it. Worse, it seems to affect those with magical skills more rapidly than any others...<br/><br/>*Luddites - A small but growing group of anti-magical Luddities engage in acts of random magical terrorism. They have not been able to attack any of the capitol wizard-cities yet... but they are definitely planning something big                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67877/#Comment_67877" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T10:29:27+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 10:29AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got an essay on this: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/magic/magicandsociety.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Magic and Society in RPGs</b></a><br/><br/>A key thing to note is that most magic systems developed for RPGs unsurprisingly favor a small band of individuals as opposed to an organized state.  i.e. The magic enables the small band to get into the castle / dungeon / whatever.  Unless you change the magic system, this will have a vastly different effect than the industrial revolution of our history.  Large nation-states will never develop, and instead you'll have highly balkanized societies with a lot of coups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67888/#Comment_67888" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T11:00:18+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 11:00AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Except that, alongside the "buff up a handful of supercommandoes" spells, there are plenty of magic systems that offer instantaneous long-distance communication (as you note in your essay), which overcomes the greatest historical barrier to centralized imperial governments. And (again, as you note), a lot of systems offer cheap, low-level "make plants grow better" spells that would allow for much higher crop yields, and thus much higher populations, in societies that were sufficiently organized to train lots of workaday wizards or fertility priests; and historically, the need to collaborate to make large-scale agriculture work (e.g. complex irrigation systems) is a major boost to the power of centralized managerial elites, from the priests of Sumeria to the imperial bureaucracy of China.<br/><br/>Even the "buff the party" spells can assist political centralization, assuming the ruling elite can magic up an elite shock force of its own -- and if the ruling elite <i>doesn't</i> have loyal wizards on hand who can cast the appropriate spells, they'll be replaced by someone who will. The introduction of cannon in Europe in the 15th century was a major blow to the power of the local barons, and a major boost to centralized authoritarian monarchy, because only the most powerful lords could afford their own siege artillery, and once they had it, they could smash everyone else's castles. A party of high-level fighters with Invisibility and/or Teleport spells could provide the same kind of edge to a ruling monarch against every lesser noble too poor to afford the necessary counterspells and wards.<br/><br/>In fact, the big difference between real-world technology and magic as generally depicted in RPGs is that, with enough training, anyone can learn to use technology, and even build and design it, but only those born with the gift can learn to cast spells. All this implies a relatively small sorcerous elite using its monopoly on magic to dominate the mundane population. It doesn't even require active repression: If you don't pay your taxes, the hierarchy won't bless your crops, and you'll starve on what you can grow by conventional means alone.<br/><br/>The especially scary implications are things like magical life extension, mind reading, and mind control. You can very easily get a sorcerous totalitarian state ruled by effectively immortal wizards and their absolutely loyal security forces, with repression coordinated across continental distances by crystal ball and even everyday agriculture dependent on a state-controlled bureaucracy of petty priests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67893/#Comment_67893" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T11:13:06+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 11:13AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and trade: Magic in most roleplaying games is <i>not</i> good at bulk transport. But a lot of them do have spells to control the weather, aid in navigation, and (as mentioned above) communicate instantaneously at long range. For a society stuck with premodern technology, this would make a moderate difference on land but a <i>huge</i> difference at sea. Sailing ships in particular would be much safer and more reliable: If the wind's blowing the wrong direction, change it! Depending on how common weather magic is in a particular system and setting, you might have a weathermage on a each ship, or, more likely, one for a whole fleet of trading, fishing, or fighting ships.<br/><br/>The result would be to turn the map "inside-out" from a traditional land-oriented perspective. Since most RPG magic improves land travel less than sea travel, sea routes become more important than land routes, just as with the 16th and 17th century ebbing of the Silk Road across Central Asia and the rise of Western tradining colonies all around the periphery of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. So I'd expect the centralized magocracies I'd described above to look more like the British Empire than the Russian Empire, with a strong presence on the coasts of many continents but diminishing influence inland.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68029/#Comment_68029" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T13:36:58+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  1:36PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The more I think about it, the more I wonder how satisfying this would be.  What people seem to want is an organic blend of technology &amp; magic in a way different from the "we already had technology when magic was (re)discovered/awakened" idea.  Furthermore, this is wanted in a world where such ideas are open and accepted as the norm, as opposed to the typical underground/secret society theme that many modern fantasy stories and games use.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>That's a pretty open-ended idea.  Can you pin-point something more specific?  Is it that you want magic-powered chainguns?  Well, then *poof* have yourself some magic-powered chainguns.  You can do that with pretty much anything, if you're looking to flavor a world with a mix of magic &amp; tech.  I might suggest the Merlin setting in GURPS Infinite Worlds for this, if not for the fact that it's a "magic was discovered in the 1940s" setting rather than a "magic was always here" setting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andrew Kenrick</cite>And I'm not talking a modern fantasy as we convention normally has it, whereby fantasy elements are grafted onto our own world (a la Urban Arcana, Shadowrun, Neverwhere, Harry Potter) but a fantasy world advanced into a modern age akin to our own</blockquote>\nI can't see how this is possible, if you want something that adheres to reality.  (If you don't care about that, then my post won't have any bearing on your thoughts.)  You know the old saying, "necessity is the mother of invention"?  Well, it's true.  We have the inventions that we do because we did not have the capabilities or access to do things without them.<br/><br/>Here are some ideas, and I apologize for the gross oversimplification here:<br/>Cars?  Horses tire and we need to get from point A to B without using railroads, because they can't get you everywhere.<br/>Guns?  The firepower of the cannon in the hands on a person can (and as we see, has) re-define warfare, and eliminate the need for large melee battles.<br/>Telecommunications?  Communicating over long distances allows us to plan and coordinate over large spaces, administer a government more centrally, and reduces the anxiety of travelers who are leaving family &amp; friends behind.<br/>Medicine?  People get hurt &amp; sick, and we want to ability to make that not happen &amp; reverse what has happened.<br/><br/>All of these can be fixed by magic.  If Cure Disease fixes many of life's problems, we would never have invented the antibacterial ointments or the MRI.  Why invent cars in Teleport is a viable option?  If you take away the needs these devices solve, we won't have those devices -- and that's what magic does, takes away such needs.  Why would you bother to research mundane technology when magic is there and it already fulfills those needs you have?<br/><br/>Answer that question -- and there are many different, often incompatible answers -- and you'll have a more organic world, but I doubt it would anything like what we're use to, and would look at least as alien and unfamiliar as the typical sword &amp; sorcery fantasy we all know.  I know I wouldn't be satisfied with a "world much like ours, but always with magic" because that world would have taken so many different turns in its evolution that we wouldn't recognize it at all like our own.  (And if we did, I would honestly be disappointed that the world of magic and the world without arrived at the same state.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68037/#Comment_68037" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T13:49:11+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  1:49PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Why invent cars in Teleport is a viable option?

Now, the exact nature of your magic system makes a huge difference here: If a wizard can enchant devices that any mundane can use, you get something "indistinguishable from technlogy"; if it takes innate magical ability to use an enchanted item, you get something very different from technology.<br/><br/>And it's especially different if magical ability is inherited in a fairly obvious way, as is implied in a lot of fantasies. ("The Force is strong in your family..."). A world with strongly heritable magic is going to tend towards a magical nobility lording it over mundane commoners -- and probably actively discouraging innovation in mundane technologies that could replicate magical effects. A world where magical ability appears unpredictably all over the population is going to tend towards some kind of meritocracy -- any society that refuses to cultivate magical talent of its common people is going to get run over by those that do -- and even perhaps universal education, to help find the potential mages, and active encouragement of mundane technological research into duplicating magical effects so you can free up your hard-to-find mages to do what only they can do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68046/#Comment_68046" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T14:01:38+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  2:01PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aside from the adult content, the Ironwood setting (as exemplified in the comics and the theatrix source book) is a good sample of a modern fantasy the way the OP described it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68050/#Comment_68050" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T14:06:34+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  2:06PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sydney Freedberg</cite>Because magic is usually depicted as the innate talent of a minority of people, something that not everyone can use</blockquote>\nThat's one of many answers to my question.

And (again, as you note), a lot of systems offer cheap, low-level "make plants grow better" spells that would allow for much higher crop yields, and thus much higher populations, in societies that were sufficiently organized to train lots of workaday wizards or fertility priests; and historically, the need to collaborate to make large-scale agriculture work (e.g. complex irrigation systems) is a major boost to the power of centralized managerial elites, from the priests of Sumeria to the imperial bureaucracy of China.<br/><br/>Even the "buff the party" spells can assist political centralization, assuming the ruling elite can magic up an elite shock force of its own -- and if the ruling elite <i>doesn't</i> have loyal wizards on hand who can cast the appropriate spells, they'll be replaced by someone who will. The introduction of cannon in Europe in the 15th century was a major blow to the power of the local barons, and a major boost to centralized authoritarian monarchy, because only the most powerful lords could afford their own siege artillery, and once they had it, they could smash everyone else's castles.  A party of high-level fighters with Invisibility and/or Teleport spells could provide the same kind of edge to a ruling monarch against every lesser noble too poor to afford the necessary counterspells and wards.</blockquote>\nI disagree.  The plant boost spells don't require large-scale infrastructure or organization in the way that aqueducts and mills do.  All they need is a single individual (a 5th level Druid, in the case of D&amp;D).  Such spells will push in the opposite direction, allowing people to easily split off from the empire and make a life for themselves elsewhere if they have a druid with them.  <br/><br/>I similarly disagree about the adventurers.  This is the fallacy that if you give the same thing to both sides, everything will balance out.  That's not true.  RPG magic helps you enormously if you want to break into the palace/castle/whatever, and very little if you want to defend it.  If the imperial government has an elite shock forces of its own to combat the rebel shock forces, then the net result will be dead leaders on both sides.  Without the stabilizing infrastructure, the imperial shock troops will remain victorious, but the empire will crumble.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68066/#Comment_68066" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T14:21:57+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  2:21PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I, for one, dislike the "genetic predisposition to magic" thing.

But definitely, there are people who claim that they have some kind of power because one of their ancestors had the same power. It seems to be common among dowsers and wart charmers.</p>\n<p>However, inheritable powers aren't usually the sole kind of magical power; there's also gaining powers through extraordinary circumstances (seventh son of a seventh son, born with a caul) and through knowledge of occult secrets. The latter is often considered evil, or potentially so.</p>\n<p>As for fantasy, Fletcher Pratt wrote a novel called The Blue Star which was about witches who passed on their powers through the female line and a magical artifact that gave powers to a man, but only if it is first activated by a witch. Katherine Kurtz's Deryni Chronicles had two different lines of magical inheritance. E.R. Eddison's The Worm Ouroboros had an inheritable magic that skipped generations.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68094/#Comment_68094" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T15:03:55+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  3:03PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Oh, and isn't magical aptitude inheritable in the Harry Potter books?</p>\n<p>I forgot to add also that I would like a magic system that requires knowledge only, but not aptitude.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68098/#Comment_68098" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T15:13:26+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  3:13PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Secret of Zir'An, or anything like Final Fantasy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68104/#Comment_68104" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T15:45:36+00:00" title="May  9, 2007  3:45PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm definitely on the same wavelength as Andrew here, awesome stuff!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Secret of Zir'An, or anything like Final Fantasy.</blockquote>\nUnfortunately, Zir'an doesn't really push the envelope here.

Remember that a guy who goes around blessing crops all day is almost certainly not an "adventurer" type, and that for every master in any profession there are usually multiple journeymen and apprentices assisting and learning.<br/>Well, we're delving deeply into just a single example here, but it's potentially useful if we want to explore what the effects of magic are.  In D&amp;D3, a 5th level druid can cast plant growth only once or twice a day depending on his wisdom, but remember it lasts a year, so he can permanently maintain over 200 square miles of plant growthed territory.  Given the abstract experience system, it's impossible to tell how hard it is for an NPC to get to any level.  However, the DMG indicates that 1 in 10 small rural communities have a high-level druid (level 8+), and a 6th or 7th level druid is typical of a large town of 2000 to 5000.  That's plenty to keep all the fields necessary to feed the population under plant growth.  <br/><br/>If you're working from GURPS, note that the systems are quite different.  In the GURPS magic system  spells can be cast nearly constantly, especially if you're using ritual magic where others can help power spells.  I remember reading spells like Shape Earth and Earth to Stone and immediately imagining the colossal structures that would result.  GURPS magic is rather unusual in this respect.  However, note that giving mages enormous power over others doesn't help large empires, it just helps a hierarchical culture with mages on top.  You could still have a balkanized collection of tiny mage-states.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68470/#Comment_68470" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T10:23:34+00:00" title="May 11, 2007 10:23AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, but to cover "Fantasy Modern" a little more generally: <br/><br/>I think a common goal of "Fantasy Modern" is to make a <b>parallel history</b> -- i.e. something that mirrors our own history in general trends, but with different specifics.

The Lord Darcy stories might be closer to what Andrew's thinking of; they're patterned after the Victorian era rather than the modern era, but there's more of a feeling that Randall Garrett thought about the consequences of magic being real and developed the setting from those ideas.
