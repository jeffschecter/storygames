[speaking draconic] 20 squares [a good range for missile fighters, ability to come at site from different directions, ability to avoid encounter, longer not sensible in the wooded terrain]<br/>- from that point, moving up etc. we go into combat time actions and that may require more stealth checks<br/><br/>PC's making perception &amp; failing stealth = even footing in encounter, no surprise round: There are small reptile-men moving into place around you, though they\u2019re not quite yet at \u201ccombat range\u201d (by not being stealthy they didn't get chance to spot the harpy, who is 100% concealed further back in woods) - they\u2019re difficult to spot among the trees. 10 squares (a respectable distance, can back peddle for more distance, close to engage, lots of terrain features around in between)<br/><br/>PC's fail perception &amp; make stealth = close encounter, You realize there are creatures in the woods around you, that you have blundered into even as they blundered into you.  No surprise; encounter starts at close quarters.  5 squares.   <br/><br/>PC's fail perception &amp; stealth = bad ambush, just a bad ambush on the road if failure not by 5+, if failure by 5+ the monsters trail PC\u2019s till they make camp and attack on the 1st watch (which coincidentally is in an area battle map wise much like the first 3 even if narratively someplace else), You have just fallen asleep when an attack comes!  Individual perception checks for the PCs on watch (PC who failed originally doesn\u2019t reroll); monsters surprise from ideal positions.  5 squares<br/><br/>I have started using the "everyone make Stealth, you don't fail unless majority do" instead of having the poor stealth dwarf PC be the reason they never surprise anything.<br/><br/>Exceptions for terrain just as dungeons or situations where you know the attacking goblins are coming up the valley from that direction and it's just a matter of when you spot the next wave.<br/><br/>I apply general logic of:<br/><br/>20 squares + is great for PC's (who are usually better at distance than monsters)<br/>10-20 squares is a respectable distance for getting into formation you want, taking cover etc., usually still lets party use its optimal versions of each (defenders to fore, wizard behind rock, ranger up a tree etc.)<br/>5-10 is "lets' get it on" initiative matters alot, with it the controller and striker can scramble back to cover/concealment, without it they are getting monsters in their face.<br/>0-5 is advantage suprise range "PC's caught with pants down if surprised, but ideal if surprising as it's within charge and hit 'em in first suprise round range".<br/><br/>Would be interested to know other's experience, thinking.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232290/#Comment_232290" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T13:29:53+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  1:29PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll bet experience differs with the size of people's graph paper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232334/#Comment_232334" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T17:35:33+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  5:35PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2009 6:57PM by johnzo.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, I don't think I would use a generalized system for starting encounter range, because...\n<blockquote>the outputs would be<br/>A) Surprise, if any<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> encounter distance</blockquote>\n...those outputs need to become inputs to the battlemat setup.  My battlemats are special snowflakes.  I want them to be big fun drivers.

If terrain or visibility suggests a short-range encounter (dense forest or thick fog, for example), use 5 squares instead. In wide-open areas, such as rolling hills or farmland, use 20 squares. In open terrain, characters might see monsters at even greater distances, which gives them a chance to try to avoid an encounter entirely (especially if the monsters don\u2019t see them). Don\u2019t start an outdoor encounter with either the characters or the monsters at the edge of the map. Leave room for everyone to move around, which for some characters often means getting away to a safer distance from the monsters.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">An area about 10 squares by 16 squares is a good minimum for parties of seven or more characters.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Room to Move: Make sure everyone has enough room to move around. For most encounters, the minimum is an area roughly 8 to 10 squares on a side (which happens to be the size of the largest D&amp;D; Dungeon Tiles). For an important encounter, consider a space as large as 16 or 20 squares on a side (two of those 8-square-by-10-square dungeon tiles). A postersize map like those included in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Miniatures starter sets and in D&amp;D; adventures covers an area roughly 20 by 30 squares and makes a great area for a climactic battle.

Even in games like Cthulhu. The Cthulhu book doesn't say to roll spot hidden for obvious things. But when the modules do, a culture of play forms around it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I've found several of the modules we played started the players out within 6 squares or less of the monsters in dungeons.

Like many things in dnd now, they were surprised because the story or game required it. Its great to say that the PC's are a sneaky bunch that could obviously detect and foil an ambush at Tiamat pass but in reality I find this leads either to passive aggressive jacking and penalizing of hide or spot on the side of the gm or players or encounters going according to plan either way. <br><br>I don't think I need to give all my soldiers extra ranks in hide in order to make an ambush effective. It seems silly?<br/><br/>As for your players bitching, isn't this your sandbox game? Tell your players to get in the sandbox and out of the gm's box. What they are suggesting would work for some games and do no harm for others, but remember all those analogies to 2nd edition some defender's of made right off the start. This is part of it. Plan the starting range into the encounter itself, plan the encounter arround the starting range and I think you will find your encounters go smoother and have more awesomeness in them.

I think because I don't like letting the simulation (you see further in Saskatchewan than in Northern Ontario) dictate too much sameness etc.  I run a campaign where wooded hill-territory is the dominant default terrain and don't want every fight starting close up, instead imagining "you hear a force you can't see yet", "you see birds start from the trees" etc. that permit longer initial distances at times - e.g., if you see the descriptive text for the 20 encounter it involved seeing something in the air that drew eye and hearing stuff.  "You can hear it but not see it yet" is also a nice tension builder.<br/><br/>On other points, I too find lots of published material disregards advice in DMG.  Usually I find this reduces its value.  My biggest peeve is Quest XP that are supposed to be about "story things not simply defeating monsters, not for the same actions that earn encounter XP" yet are often presented in a way that is exactly that in modules/Dungeon magazine.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232455/#Comment_232455" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T10:04:38+00:00" title="September 15, 2009 10:04AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I do in my game when I roll up a wandering monster:<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider the terrain and sighting distance.<br/>\nI consider what the monster is doing; flying, stalking, just wandering about, lurking in ambush, etc.<br/>\nThat defines what kind of check (if any) is going to be made.  Sometimes it's PC Per vs. NPC Per, sometimes PC Stealth vs. NPC Per, sometimes PC Per vs. NPC Stealth.  If circumstances are right (dark night, no moon, fog on the moors, combined with low Per on both sides), both groups might wander into each other and be surprised.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I rolled up the bandits who prey on the King's Road from the bluffs overlooking the road, I used the PC's Passive Perception check vs. the NPC's Passive Stealth.  The bandit was stalking the PCs and they dealt with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I rolled up a bunch of griffons, the PCs spotted them flying from a distance away; since the PCs had no horses, the griffons ignored them.  The PCs were able to spot which mountain top they roost on (Perception check).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I rolled up the forsaken shell who was patrolling the entrance to the Keep on the Shadowfell, it was lurking, so I compared Passive Perception vs. its Passive Steath; the PCs missed it and it followed the PCs into the Keep.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally I'd use Passive checks, but if the PCs want to be "on the lookout" I'd reduce their movement and allow them to make a roll.  That means Aid Another is in play, so the result is almost always going to be better than Passive Perception.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232521/#Comment_232521" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T16:22:54+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  4:22PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stou'n</cite>John, that "who sets up first" model looks like my solution,</blockquote>\nCool, lemme know how it goes!<br><br>And thanks for asking the question, it got me thinking about some stuff that'll be useful in an upcoming D&amp;D session.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232527/#Comment_232527" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T18:40:13+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  6:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's kinda my point, I don't think random encounter distance empowers pc's anymore than random encounters, random terrain, or random branches in the hallway of a dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
