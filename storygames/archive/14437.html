He had us each pick out seeds from the examples in the book and, of course, I went with the most Bowie-esque. Tori picked a boy with bruises and Joel went with the reluctant dwarf. <br/><br/><b>Introduction:</b><br/><br/>10-year-old Derek has just confronted his mother\u2019s abusive boyfriend. His bruises are still fresh. She comes outside to lecture him on privacy and scold him for throwing rocks against the shed. When Derek talks back to her, they have a screaming match. Derek runs off along the nearby railroad track until he reaches the school playground, where he is seen by a kindly old teacher, Mr. Wilson, who invites him to dinner. <br/><br/>At the house, Mrs. Wilson is worried about her husband\u2019s lack of forethought in bringing a young student to their house without alerting Derek\u2019s parents. However, she is delighted when the boy finds Mr. Wilson\u2019s lost wedding ring in the driveway (Gift established: Can find anything). <br/><br/>After Derek\u2019s mom has come to pick him up from the Wilsons\u2019 she talks to him with quiet exasperation about her embarrassment. She is fed up with his behavior. The conversation explodes when Derek yells at his mother and he escapes the car into the house. (Flaw established: Always say the wrong thing at exactly the wrong time). His mother stomps up the stairs behind him, threatening to beat him. Curiously, Derek\u2019s window is open and there is a hole in the air beyond it. Desperate to escape his punishment, he leaps through the window and lands in a small cobble-stone room with a pit, two doors, and a beautiful man. He is safe\u2026 for the moment.<br/><br/><b>The Threat:</b><br/><br/>The attractive stranger introduces himself as Vide (Nemesis established) and offers Derek an escape. He gestures towards the unknowable pit in the center of the room and reminds Derek of how hard and terrible his life is. Within the pit, none of that will matter (Power established: Nothingness/Void). Sensing the malevolence emanating from Vide, Derek instead offers to help him here in this world and work for him. (Peril, Invoking Flaw vs. Power; Result: Light Stone drawn). <br/><br/>Vide is outraged by the offer of \u201chelp\u201d. He screams at Derek that not only does he not need anything from anyone, but that it\u2019s impossible for one person to \u201chelp\u201d another. During his tirade, Vide is slowly circling the pit in the center of the room and getting closer to Derek, just when the red door on the wall pops open to reveal a grumbling dwarf (Companion established: Grumschack).<br/><br/>The <b>Journey</b>, <b>Journey\u2019s End</b>, and more commentary to be added.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328234/#Comment_328234" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T12:26:55+00:00" title="June  7, 2011 12:26PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            this is good stuff, i want to keep reading                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328243/#Comment_328243" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T12:59:30+00:00" title="June  7, 2011 12:59PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite>but that it\u2019s impossible for one person to \u201chelp\u201d another.</blockquote>\nLove that bit.

Thank you for posting this. Your description is very evocative and clear--that last quality is something I sometimes miss, being so wrapped up in my own game. It's great to see it through fresh eyes.<br/><br/>I second Tori on playing the mom. It was brilliant. She was so real, her pain and dysfunction sketched out with a few deft strokes of dialog and mannerism. Have you ever played Fiasco? You'd excel.<br/><br/>My favorite Mom dialog: "God, can you just not be in the way all the time? <i>Get yourself together, Derek</i>." Said to a ten year old. So terrible. So good.<br/><br/>Vide was great, too. Often when playing the Nemesis (or Companion, for that matter) I have to resort to theatrics and cryptic allusions (which, at least, ARE in genre) until I figure out what their "deal" is. But you had a clear and pitch-perfect philosophy and approach for Vide that was a joy to listen to. It was a real challenge (and a good, creatively fruitful one!) for me to find a compelling counterpoint for Grumschak to express.<br/><br/>I think I'll let you keep describing. You're doing great.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS. Daniel, do you own the book or have someone in your town who does?

Derek, still worrying about Vide\u2019s fury from a moment ago, asks if he can accompany the dwarf on his errands. Grumschack sees no problem with that as long as Derek doesn\u2019t get in the way of him fixing \u201cblockages\u201d. As the two leave, Vide mocks Derek for refusing his offer, \u201cHe [Grumschack] won\u2019t be able to help you. You\u2019ll still have the same problems. And I\u2019ll be here with the same offer.\u201d <br/><br/>This begins the exploration of the Summerlands. There are several short scenes which involve Grumschack temporarily solving problems (blockages) mostly with his presence. At one point he breaks up two dwarves fighting over mead and Derek finds the combatants a second cup. As they leave the abashed dwarves, they hear one hit the other. Next, a piece of fruit sprouts legs and falls off its tree, running ahead of them playfully. As the ambulatory fruit bends over to \u201cmoon\u201d them, it is struck dead by a volley of Q-tip sized arrows. Goblins emerge from the bushes and savagely pummel the fruit into the ground, with no apparent intention of eating it. When Grumschack picks the goblins up and scolds them, they appear to calm down, but it is clear that they aren\u2019t likely to change their destructive ways. The goal of these scenes is to demonstrate to Derek that individuals will always fight and the weak will always be picked on, neither of which should surprise him. It also emphasizes the temporary nature of Grumschack\u2019s ability to resolve blockages and highlight his impotency. (Power established: Inevitable Violence). <br/><br/>The next problem that the boy and dwarf encounter is two stone trolls, pawing the ground and getting ready to charge each other. The larger has accused the smaller one of stealing his club. Grumschack stands between the two, while Derek spots the club. However, instead of revealing his find, he hides the club farther in the forest, perhaps remembering the quarreling dwarves earlier (Peril: Gift \u201cCan find anything\u201d vs. Power \u201cInevitable Violence\u201d; Result: Light Stone drawn). <br/><br/>The smaller of the two stone trolls decides to accompany Grumschack and Derek, so as not to get beaten when they leave. The troll introduces himself as Bob, and eventually explains that he used to build bridges until he traded Vide his bridge-building tools for a lack of desire to build bridges. Bob is certain that he has gotten the better end of the deal, since trolls are shrewd traders. He is now contemplating another trade with Vide; one where he will trade Vide his body for a lack of all desires and needs. The troll explains that his needs and desires are overwhelming. For example, his lack of friends has been driving him nuts. When Derek offers to be Bob\u2019s friend, he says the Wrong Thing at Exactly the Wrong Time. Bob informs Derek that trolls don\u2019t need charity and he sets off ahead of them on the path. <br/><br/>Now following Bob, the dwarf and boy find that the path leads to a tunnel. Outside the tunnel stands Vide (it appears that Grumschack\u2019s blockage fixing circuit forms a tight circle that leads back to the pit). When Bob approaches, Vide beckons him inside. Grumschack plods along, heading into the tunnel, and Derek worriedly follows them all, but not before he finds the Bag of Nothing that Vide has dropped outside. <br/><br/><b>Journey\u2019s End</b><br/><br/>The tunnel leads back to the other door of the room with the pit in the center, and now there is a hole in the ceiling that reveals the side of Derek\u2019s house. Inside the room, Vide is convincing Bob of the merits of his \u201cdeal\u201d. As Derek approaches, Bob scowls at the boy. It seems certain that Bob will jump into the pit. Just before the troll can be convinced to do so, Derek interrupts to say that he has a trade for Vide. The beautiful man scoffs at Derek saying that he needs nothing, that he is complete. However, his self-aggrandizing rant starts to lose steam midway and he begins to pat his pockets until finally he stares at Derek and asks, \u201cWhere is it?\u201d<br/><br/>Derek produces the Bag of Nothing and offers it in exchange for a promise that Vide won\u2019t trade with Bob. Vide agrees, haughtily insinuating that Bob is basically worthless anyway, since he\u2019s a troll who doesn\u2019t build bridges. Derek reaches across the pit to hand Vide the bag, but then throws it in the pit. Vide jumps in the after it, and the world of the Summerlands starts to implode around the pit. Bob reaches up and grasps the edge of the hole in the ceiling and tells Derek to climb up his body. Grumschack follows, and the two of them end up back in Derek\u2019s room. Bob is forced to remain behind. Vide is also gone for now, but it is obvious that this is just a minor setback. He has the rest of Derek\u2019s difficult life to seal the deal. (Nemesis transformation: There is always a pull from the void).<br/><br/><b>Homecoming</b><br/><br/>In Derek\u2019s room, Grumschack starts to fade. He reassures Derek that things will be all right. Derek is sorry for about losing his companion, but his reverie is broken by the sound of violence downstairs. His mother\u2019s current boyfriend is on a rampage.<br/>Derek moves quickly. He runs downstairs and sneaks in through the front door after locating the man\u2019s wedding ring in the driveway. He yells at his mother\u2019s boyfriend who starts to come after him, but then he offers to make a trade with the man. The man is startled by the offer, and the tone in the room changes. When Derek produces the ring, his mother accuses the man of being a liar and they drive him from the house.<br/><br/>After the \u201cboyfriend\u201d is gone, Derek\u2019s mother tentatively apologizes to him. She offers to make him some dinner and play ends. <br/><br/><br/>Tori and Joel, please chime in with any factual corrections and commentary. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve gotten some of it wrong. I know I have forgotten at least one transformation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328776/#Comment_328776" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T09:26:39+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  9:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Commentary</b><br/><br/>Before play, Joel was careful to point out the three guiding rules that are listed in the front of the book: Say What You See, Live in The Moment, and Lift One Another Up. I didn\u2019t do so great at the first, as I\u2019ll discuss later, and I blatantly violated the second. As soon as I realized Vide\u2019s first power, I started planning a little. I was nervous that I would have nothing to offer, so I kept notes on blank sheet of paper. It lead to scenes on the Journey that I felt were a bit railroady. What made the game playable was that everyone Lifted One Another Up. We took each other\u2019s ideas and ran with them. Several times I floundered and looked for help, and the other players jumped in smoothly with the handoff. <br/><br/>I had a blast playing The Dreaming Crucible and I was lucky to play it with such great players. Joel kindly let me be the Dark Faerie, which is quite a job. It comes with a lot of narrative responsibility. Also, strangely, I ended up playing Bob, who, as a friendly character, might have been the purview of the Light Faerie. Maybe Joel could comment on that. For the rest of my commentary, I have a quick bit of advice for beginners to The Dreaming Crucible, a little bit of mechanical discussion, and a list of narrative regrets. <br/><br/>My advice for beginners like myself is to let the genre inform you. I picked my seed (the beautiful man who offers a terrible gift) based on a predisposition to Bowie, but when I had to think of his power, I ended up choosing Nothing which I ganked from the Neverending Story. I changed it up a bit since I wanted it to be choice that must be freely taken, and it ended up representing suicide instead of just apathy and cynicism. <br/><br/>Skip to the end of this paragraph if discussing math for a game about Faerie Realms disgusts you. Next time I play the Dark Faerie, I will use my beads much more sparingly. Together, the Companion and the Heroine have a 20% numerical advantage, according to the copy of the book I have. Additionally, the Dark Faerie player puts their beads in the bag first, which allows the Heroine and Companion to carefully match the bid. My strategy would be to play one bead at a time more often, instead of throwing tons in and trying to overwhelm the Heroine. I\u2019d also create more imposing Perils, and then only use one bead at a time, trying to get the Heroine to over commit their beads so they would be at a deficit later when it mattered. I\u2019d definitely threaten the companion more, since those silly good guys always want to help one another out. I believe using my beads more sparingly would also have increased the likelihood of transformations dictated by the opposing player, since more beads end up getting drawn. This would have increased the length of the game, which would have been fine with me.<br/><br/>I did a poor job of narrating time, as usual, so everything happened in about one afternoon in the Summerlands. I wish I had fast forwarded the game a bit to add some depth. Maybe have Derek go to sleep in the Summerlands. I keep thinking of options for torturing that kid that I now wish I could have tried. For example; A young girl about Derek\u2019s age makes a shushing with her forefinger to her lips, and gestures for him to follow her with her other hand. She runs off and if Derek chases her, leaving Grumschack, he is picked on a beaten by nicely dressed gnomes. (Peril Inevitable Violence). If I had slowed down and taken my time, I could have really driven home the terribleness of life in the Summerlands and the hopelessness of Derek\u2019s existence to make the metaphor of suicide more inviting. <br/><br/>Also, I barely described the Summerlands, despite pointed promptings like, \u201cAre we in a forest right now?\u201d I was so worried about the next Peril that I didn\u2019t take time to stop and narrate the roses. The best description I narrated wasn\u2019t even mine. Tori mentioned the fruit with legs idea during the break and I quickly incorporated it. Both of the other players did a good job of Lifting One Another Up. <br/><br/>I also regret a missed opportunity when Vide jumped in the pit. Joel prompted me for some great last words at that point, but I totally choked. I should have quoted Of Montreal: \u201cThe world is not a prison, Derek, you are free to leave at any time.\u201d <br/><br/><br/>Anyway, this game was effin\u2019 <i>magical</i> in many senses of the word. I can\u2019t wait to play as the Dark Faerie again and just scar the dang \u2018ole heck out of an already traumatized child.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329261/#Comment_329261" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T15:51:57+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  3:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i></i><blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite><b>Commentary</b><br/>Before play, Joel was careful to point out the three guiding rules that are listed in the front of the book: Say What You See, Live in The Moment, and Lift One Another Up.

Looking back, yeah, I can see how there could've been some planning behind your actions, but it didn't feel that way at the time. All of your input felt pretty right to me, and if anything I fell down in my duty to Lift You Up by co-describing Faerie with you. I fell into just narrating Grumschack's actions and leaving you to fill in the landscape and inhabitants, which is actually how the Light Faerie can run if that player is inexperienced or stuck for ideas, but as game facilitator it was probably weak sauce for me to fall back on that and leave with you with the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>Now, I'm resisting the urge to just go all softie as the designer and say "well gwarsh, it was just a suggestion, you can live outside the moment in your game if you want." I mean, you ("you" as in "whoever") CAN if you want, but I do stand behind the Principles as fruitful for Crucible play, and you're right to reflect on where you struggled with them, But still, the Principles aren't meant to be applied pedantically, like "Oh! I had a thought about what happened next, I'm not Living in the Moment!" or "I thought too long about what to say, I'm not Saying What I See!" It's more like: is thinking forward detracting from your enjoyment of the here and now? Is straining for cleverness or profundity rendering the fiction forced and unnatural? Is the unfolding of your brilliant plan and bold artistic vision stymying the interplay if creative input among all the players? In THAT case, pull back and just say the obvious thing/concentrate on what's happening right now/look for ways to build on others' ideas.<br/><br/>It's not QUITE a case of "only apply these rules when you're stuck." The Principles ARE in effect at all times, but they generally only need <i>attention</i> when someone's stuck, or haring off in some wild direction. There is a learning curve, though, where you may need to attend to and invoke them more often as you retrain your habits, before you're ready to let them fall away into the backgrouond. It's then that you'll be able to integrate planned themes and arcs, and stuff, though you'll still need to hold to your plans loosely. Being natural, spontaneous and collaborative, <i>while also</i> attending to the larger structure and themes of the story, is a pretty high-order skill.<br/><br/>But I don't wanna dwell too much on figuring out who failed and how. Part of Live in the Moment is putting those judging spectres aside and accepting what happens. It's cool to reflect on what worked well and how it could be improved for next time, but it's not about failure, just growth. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite><b>Commentary</b><br/>I did a poor job of narrating time, as usual, so everything happened in about one afternoon in the Summerlands. I wish I had fast forwarded the game a bit to add some depth. Maybe have Derek go to sleep in the Summerlands. I keep thinking of options for torturing that kid that I now wish I could have tried....If I had slowed down and taken my time, I could have really driven home the terribleness of life in the Summerlands and the hopelessness of Derek\u2019s existence to make the metaphor of suicide more inviting.<br/><br/>Also, I barely described the Summerlands, despite pointed promptings like, \u201cAre we in a forest right now?\u201d I was so worried about the next Peril that I didn\u2019t take time to stop and narrate the roses. The best description I narrated wasn\u2019t even mine. Tori mentioned the fruit with legs idea during the break and I quickly incorporated it. Both of the other players did a good job of Lifting One Another Up.<br/><br/>I also regret a missed opportunity when Vide jumped in the pit. Joel prompted me for some great last words at that point, but I totally choked. I should have quoted Of Montreal: \u201cThe world is not a prison, Derek, you are free to leave at any time.\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nAgain, I'd say some of this was pretty high-order stuff you're worried about. Would it be great to draw out the passage of time in the story, let it breathe, build the themes? Absolutely! But honestly, most Crucible games have gone like ours did, with a fairly quick progression from point A to B. Honestly, the earliest games were so bare of description that they make ours look like Tolstoy by comparison. So that too, is a skill to build on for future games. Hopefully it will get richer the more you play it!<br/><br/>And on that note, I didn't find your descriptions lacking. Your ideas, simplistic though they may have seemed to you, seemed to me to be rich and fitting. Now, it does sound like you were slipping out of the Moment a bit, so great, now you know what to watch out for. I just want you to know that from where I was sitting it didn't feel like you were falling down on the job or missing opportunities. Whenever I ask for description, please know that I'm making an offer, not a request: "Is there anything you'd like to contribute right here that might get lost if I don't speak up?" For instance, while that ending line would've been sweet, I though the complacent look, you described, like :"don't worry, you haven't seen the lasdt of me" was pretty awesome in itself.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
