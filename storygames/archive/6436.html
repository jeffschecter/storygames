I'm sure you know what I mean. I have a setting and a bunch of plot hooks ready in my head, but I'm still very open to suggestions.<br/><br/>Any ideas/advice from fellow storygamers before I start? Anything from "you should definitely use D&amp;D 4ed for that" to "we've had this really fun gaming episode once..." is appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142591/#Comment_142591" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T04:27:36+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  4:27AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was pondering using a similar premise, maybe with PTA: a kind of SWAT team in a fantasy high magic city.<br/><br/>The team would comprise, off the top of my head:<br/><br/>1 - Recon/Stealth: lightly armed, protected with invisibility and stealth wards, ideally a thief/rogue skillset I guess.<br/>2 - Protector/Tower: as soon as the squad teleports on the site launches various area spells locking teleports out, reducing other mages powers, and so on. Ideally, he could plant a wide area ward building a "dome" to trap inside the wrongdoers.<br/>3 - One or more guerrilla fighters, specialized in close distance magical combat and disabling: fast, with weapons/tools that take down the offenders fast (with or without killing them, it's up to you)<br/><br/>Optionally,<br/>4 - A "heavy weapons" guy, generally some kind of battle mage able to lay down suppression fire, area effect spells and the good old fireballs.<br/>5 - A crack shot, specializing in long distance magical disabling/killing... Imagine a magic wand/rod with a magic scope and shoulder mount... a magic crackshot rifle, basically.<br/><br/>I'd call the series<br/><br/>"The Tower Shield", and the squad leader would definitely be played by Michael Chicklis in full dwarven regalia (but always bald) :-D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142711/#Comment_142711" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T13:52:38+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  1:52PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2008 1:52PM by Bryan.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could use Pinnacle Empty Quiver to run it. The <a href="http://www.nessmuking.com/games/PEQ_v3.pdf" rel="nofollow">latest version</a> is much simplified. In the text, the Specialty Roles would have to be changed to more appropriate types and five skills per Specialty would have to be dreamed up. I think the Soldiering and Combat skills could be left much the same.<br/><br/>Sample changes to Roles:<br/><br/>Head Wizard = Commander<br/>Wizard of Power = Weapons Sergeant<br/>Tinkerer/Alchemist = Engineering Sergeant<br/>Cleric = Medical Sergeant<br/>Necromancer = Communications Sergeant<br/>Empathic Wizard = Intelligence Specialist<br/><br/>Anyway, the game works now and just needs some fine-tuning and if the system is up your alley, it would work for this without too much modification.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142932/#Comment_142932" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T12:54:50+00:00" title="May  7, 2008 12:54PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The old GURPS supplement 'Technomancer' has a lot of ideas about this sort of thing.
