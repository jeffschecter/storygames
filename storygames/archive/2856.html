A playable, thorough game. Which means it has to be playtested. And, that the goal of doing is is making a fun game, rather than measuring each others' cocks and nodding in approval.<br/><br/>If you're going to make a joke (or, you know, not make one) then do that. Make it actually funny.<br/><br/>Stop confusing the two. Because our "games" are starting to look like cocks with tick marks. PUNCH THEM.</blockquote>\nTo throw in my two cents:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: myself</cite>Be aware that although your Masterpiece and your Cock Waving Joke are very different in your own mind, someone who's taking a first look into indie games might not "get it".</blockquote>\nNow, Matt's thrown his opinion of the issue down in a lot of places. Sometimes it's felt like untimely venting, because it was off-topic and derailing. So, I'd like to see a place where that discussion was on-topic. In the Ashcan Front discussions, there was too much planning and not enough issue addressing for me to really get much out of it, personally.<br/><br/>So, Matt, others...<br/><br/>There's an issue with an informal community. We all want to share in this Forge reputation, and the indie games "movement", and a sense of collective energy... But so often momentum takes away from planning and right process and critical feedback. People get gung-ho (see the "Awesome!!11!!!!" discussions), people get frantic, and people let slip their own and the community's standards of excellence.<br/><br/>Because I'd like to believe I take part in a community which has standards of excellence.<br/><br/>And I'm interested in learning how a group can, without centralized leadership or any hierarchy, can maintain standards of excellence as it grows alarmingly fast, and as it becomes something new.<br/><br/>I've got my own answer, and anyone who wants to hear how *I* now roll can ask, but I'm interested in hearing your stuff.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64784/#Comment_64784" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T15:12:30+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  3:12PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Matt, can you expand on this?<br/><br/>"It's why this topic, and this topic only, was the only moment at Forge Midwest that EVERYONE sat for twenty minutes to dicuss (at least 20-25 people) on Sunday.

Some people had left by then, but everyone who was there for Forge Midwest on Sunday around noon or so was involved in the discussion. Not everyone spoke, although many people did. No one spoke up in dissent, though that certainly doesn't mean there was none -- I can easily see how people would not feel comforable dissenting during that particular discussion. I estimate that 25 people where there participating. I'd further estimate that at least a dozen, perhaps more, spoke about the problems I listed above and what we could do as a community to handle them.<br/><br/>I expect to see specific communication from people, like Ron, who indicated they would do so this week in the online space (not sure if that means here, at the Forge, etc.). One of the topics of the day was speaking out to others to share these concerns, point out some of the perceived problems, and suggest means to improve the situation. Which is why I have said what I've said so far. More to come, no doubt about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64789/#Comment_64789" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T15:26:09+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  3:26PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, to get to your point, my first impulse is to see how this is dealt with in other creative communities.

That's the same if you're writing a novel, touring as a band, or publishing your own game. Without encouragement, many people will not be able to muster up the energy to charge ahead. But they also need criticism to refine their creative endeavors.<br/><br/>I think of SG as more of an encouragement place. I think of the Forge as 100% criticism. When I want to have something pounded to bits, I post it at the Forge. When I want to share my excitement about something without the need yet to have it be torn to pieces, I post it elsewhere, like on my LJ or here. That's not to say there's not good critical feedback here; there is, but it's nowhere near the same thing.<br/><br/>The issue is related to something Matt W. just posted about: lots of us aren't at the Forge much anymore. I poke my head in there almost every day, but I don't post as often as I should. <br/><br/>I think it shouldn't be expected that we always criticize everything everybody does at all places without also sharing your enthusiasm. Mutual praise is not toxic per se; it's toxic ONLY if it's the only feedback you get.  But harsh criticism without support is ALSO toxic, because it demolishes the efforts and makes it look like no one gives a shit about what you're doing anyway.<br/><br/>So: middle ground. I say keep the Forge for the harsh, direct criticisms, keep other places for more supportive environments, and make a consistent effort to participate at both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64793/#Comment_64793" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T15:42:23+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  3:42PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2007 4:16PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This community makes amazing, wonderful, well-designed games. It also makes games that I don't like very much. So far, for me, the former outnumber the latter by at least 5 to 1. Probably higher than that.<br/><br/>I totally agree that we can do more to help our designs be better, and to have standards of excellence as a community. I support that idea 100%.<br/><br/>I do not agree that we are in the midst of an epidemic, slump, or disaster of any kind. I do not see evidence that too much praise is creating a toxic environment for good design. I do not see evidence that the diaspora as been a failure. I see honest, critical feedback and I see enthusiastic cheerleading and I see a wealth of great games being made along with a few that I don't love.<br/><br/>I say: If you see what you think is bad design (either before a game is published or after), and you care about its impact on the community, then you either step up with honest, critical feedback and help, or you don't. I really can't see how ranting about what the rest of the community should be doing is very helpful.<br/><br/>So, let's hear it Matt. I do not doubt your good faith in any way. I consider you a friend and a good person. But if you have criticisms to level and help to offer and standards to suggest, get on with the business of doing it already.<br/><br/>(Edit to say: I agree with Christian's post above completely)<br/><br/>(Edit again to say: I recognize the ashcan front as a great step in this direction!

I am putting over $500 to begin the Ashcan Front booth, organizing that booth, and seeking out participants. I fail to see how I could be doing more, honestly. I am, and have done, everything my resources allow to promote excellence in indie game design.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I am not alone. I think the reaction that I'm chicken-littling here is premature. John says nothing's wrong. I say there is. And, that'll shake out one way or the other. Many people have spoken up about this to me. None of them have done so yet today here on S-G. But, you know, it has been brought up here before. Thor Olavsrud spoke up about it last summer/fall. He says the largely unresponsive reaction to his criticism about lack of playtesting was very off-putting to S-G. Now, maybe that's Thor's problem, you might say. But, I can't think of one person who does a better job critiquing games well. He's extremely perceptive and knowledgeable about games, editing and actual play. I'd rather have him here than not.<br/><br/>John, will you be revising Agon? Or considering it? Because many people pointed to it this weekend and previously as one important example of a game with huge potential that needs improvement. If not, why not? And, if so, do you have a timeframe in mind? Have you received critical feedback for it? My understanding is that you have previously said the game is what it is, and you'll move on to the next thing. Is that accurate? And, if so, why is that your plan, rather than going back to revise and improve? Do you agree that it could improve? And, if you do agree but still don't want to do so, how is that not a problem for the community?<br/><br/>Others? Is your game as good as it's gonna get? Not perfect, but sound? Do you have plans to revise? Have you received criticism? Have you dismissed it? Do you know, deep down, that so-and-so was right to point out Problem X, Y, or Z, but that it was too painful or stressful or whatever to go through all that work again?<br/><br/>And, speaking of, unless you wrote one of about three A+ indie games, your game is not perfect. If no one told you a criticism that you can earnestly defend, then you need to revise your game. But, that choice is yours. Seek out that criticism, because if you're not hearing it, someone's blowing smoke up your ass. Or, just not saying anything to be nice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64799/#Comment_64799" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T16:27:18+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  4:27PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2007 4:29PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't say nothing was wrong.

But I see that as positive growth and improvement, not finger-in-the-dam patching of a catastrophe.<br/><br/>Chicken-littling? Yep. Looks like it to me.<br/><br/>The issues of revising games, good criticism, and playtesting are important! Of course I want our games to be as good as they can be. And of course I want to get better at it. I haven't decided when I'll revise Agon, but I plan to, yes. And not as some kind of patch fix, either. I am proud of that game and I think it's very good. <i>Perfection</i> to the standard of an outside critic is not a goal for me, and it never will be. But yes, I want critical feedback! Bring it on! Be totally honest! As the author, I will be the final judge of "good enough," understanding that the standards of the community are important to me too. I expect my peers to be honest with me, good or bad.<br/><br/>I just see all of this as positive growth and improvement. I'm all for it. Who wouldn't be?

A publisher who wanted in would kick in to the conglomerate. They would hopefully have a highly diverse population (i.e. not all people who spooged over the latest narration-passing hippie game), and would definitely have a required, iron-clad required format and detail level for their playtesting feedback. In other words, you wouldn't get, "we played it, it was okay" or "we didn't really get chapter 2", you would get detailed reports from each player and maybe a recording of the session, from prep through cleanup.<br/><br/>Playtesting is better than critiquing by about nine thousand percent. It hurts that much more too, and is that much harder. Importantly, you would know exactly who hates your game - hopefully the diverse population would guarantee someone would think it was the worst game they've ever played.<br/><br/>Maybe I will do that someday if I get smart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64801/#Comment_64801" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T16:37:14+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  4:37PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, it might be helpful if you outlined what you see as an optimal set of behaviors.  Because there seem to be some philosophical underpinnings to what you are saying that may not be universal.  How do you decide a game is done?  When do you feel obligated to revise?  How does iteration compare, as a value, to innovation?  Are the answers to these questions constants, or can they vary from person to person and still produce quality work?

I am putting over $500 to begin the Ashcan Front booth, organizing that booth, and seeking out participants. I fail to see how I could be doing more, honestly. I am, and have done, everything my resources allow to promote excellence in indie game design.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I am not alone. I think the reaction that I'm chicken-littling here is premature. </blockquote>\nQuit the fucking big man attitude. Seriously, it's making me sick. I started this thread because I want to know your thoughts, not your defenses.\n<blockquote>Others? Is your game as good as it's gonna get? Not perfect, but sound? Do you have plans to revise? Have you received criticism? Have you dismissed it? Do you know, deep down, that so-and-so was right to point out Problem X, Y, or Z, but that it was too painful or stressful or whatever to go through all that work again?</blockquote>\nIronic, that "Not perfect, but sound?"<br/><br/>I wrote a game and published it in 4 months. I feel that was a really stupid decision. I feel like Perfect is missing a lot of things - it is missing flavour text (all of the setting stuff, although great, is worded very textbook-like), it is missing some of the new GMing methods I've been working on, and it was missing a freakin' character sheet.<br/><br/>I was in a rush. I wanted to be cool like everyone else. Really, I did.<br/><br/>In answer to your post: Yes, it's a huge issue. You aren't alone in thinking that. I let the standards slip on my own process, and don't want to do it again. That's why I'm asking you for some useful discussion.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, I basically agree with Christian's opinion that SG isn't a good place for criticism. I don't think it was meant to be either. I think the internet (at large) is not a good place for criticism, really.<br/><br/>The reason that The Forge worked well in earlier years was that it was a microcosm. It was a smaller community where people could contribute genuinely and stay involved in each others' works. Now it feels like a really hit-or-miss place, and I know I've invested a LOT of energy in someone's game only to never hear from them again. The world is a big place, and that means a lot of misplaced energy. It's easier to do the ra-ra-Awesome story games thing than the critical feedback thing.<br/><br/>My solution was to stop trying to do critical feedback (Primary Critical Feedback) in the big wide world. I've helped organize and establish a Vancouver indie games forum, and have been doing a lot of design work with people who I actually see regularly on a daily basis. I've encouraged them, tried to read and play everything they've written, and had extensive conversations about their design decisions. That shit is possible with a small group. With a microcosm.<br/><br/>When I received my Game Designer Challenge, I started talking about how it will work on my Vancouver forum (Random Acts of Story), and only posted me "John, it's gunna kick ass" post on S-G so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64804/#Comment_64804" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T16:50:49+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  4:50PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me bring up another important point here, folks:<br/><br/>I think we should focus on helping people get the tools and feedback they need.<br/><br/>Does everybody here know how hard it can be for people to get playtesters?

I've been focusing locally, and the results have been amazing. There's a lot more investment in each other's work, and I think investment in each other's work is what playtesting is and needs to be all about. Reading a post on a thread is often a one-off, no committment thing. You can stop mid-post and do the dishes instead.<br/><br/>Doing a playtest means reading the rules, organizing people, running the game, working out kinks, reporting back, engaging discussion, and at the very least overlooking new developments. That's a shitload of work and investment, and I feel that unless you are in some way connected with the person that it takes a lot of drive to do this yourself.<br/><br/>So yeah, I used to think that developing locally was a BAD THING, because maybe the game sucked to people in Virginia as a result.

I was seeing crossed signals more so than disagreement. Not so, it now seems, which is fine.<br/><br/>I've no problem disagreeing about the degree of any problem. And, really no problem disagreeing that there is no problem whatsoever. I've been convinced otherwise. If I can't make the case, someone else might. And, if they don't, it's ok. "If people don't want to come to the ball park, how you gonna stop 'em?"<br/><br/>After thinking about it some, I do think one thing I'm seeing here and Ben's link above is that I'm crashing anyone's process. And, really that's not it. I am indeed judging (and am not alone) end products. I see things that can be better. I'm seeing them less as a really good critic of game texts and play (I'm not especially good at it, others really are good at that), and more as someone who's been through it more than once with my published games. And with other game designs I decided were not worth publishing.<br/><br/>I'm saying we (we being the indie RPG scene) have several game products that are not as good as I believe the people can make them. And, no one's forcing any publisher to do better. But, of course, with that goes judgment. If I say someone can do better, but that person doesn't want to do it, then their product is failing to meet its potential. It is, in my eyes, an inferior product. In some cases, it may not be a functional product. I think that's bad. You don't have to agree. I certainly hope you do agree, or that I might convince you constructively.<br/><br/>If you make a cake, and people say "Well, I like chocalate but this really needs more flour" why would you bother saying "Well, this is how I make cakes. I don't HAVE to make cakes with more flour!" <br/><br/>But, people don't have to eat it then, do they? That's worrying enough because I don't want anyone to fail to meet their goals. But it's also more worrying to have people come along and decide that eating any cake at all just isn't worth it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64837/#Comment_64837" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T19:20:18+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  7:20PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Groovy.

But I was at Forgecon and am really good friends with many forge game designers and publishers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI run small conventions (60-90 people) in NYC often focused around supporting independent games. And I organize a lot of gaming groups and have my ear to the ground among consumers and publishers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the past, when people complained about broken and/or unfocused RPGs in NYC they were often pointed to Forge games as alternatives. I've know many gamers who swore off games for 6-10 years that came back into the hobby after playing Forge games. These games include Dogs in the Vineyard, Prime Time Adventures, My Life With Master, Burning Wheel Revised, The Mountain Witch, and many more. These games didn't need house ruling to function, were quick reads, reasonably priced, unique, and fun. A lot of this was tied into the idea of collaboration and playtesting through the Forge (not always in public threads but also person to person from relationships born from the Forge), the use of RPG theory to focus game design, and much more. The idea was that when you bought a Forge game, there was a certain guarantee of quality. Now, the Forge is a message board, not a type of game. I know this. But none the less, this was the reputation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe number of games offered through the Forge booth at Gencon exploded. A lot of new games were purchased and brought home.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey didn't hold up to the Forge's reputation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel like that makes me sound like an asshole. I'm not trying to. And I feel bad saying that because who the fuck am I to critique as I have not gone through the process myself. But this is what I kept hearing again and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Forge grew too big.<br/>\n- Low barrier to entry.<br/>\n- Pressure to release by Gencon.<br/>\n- Pressure to fit in.<br/>\n- Pressure to make money.<br/>\n- Original designers didn't mentor enough.<br/>\n- There are games that uphold the Forge's reputation, but with such an abundance of new releases, the ratio of games that are not ready to be published that were is much higher overshadowing everything else.<br/>\n- Forge community splintering.<br/>\n- Not every game is going to be Dogs or Burning Wheel.<br/>\n- Too much attention on commerce.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it a problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n- Is this a social, economic, reputation, or community problem?<br/>\n- Does this conflict with the Forge's goals?<br/>\n- If the Forge is strictly about independent game empowerment, does the content matter?<br/>\n- If the content matters, do quality restrictions need to be put in place?<br/>\n- If people are buying these games anyway, does it matter? Or will the effects not be felt in the short term?<br/>\n- Maybe not all Forge games need to be products?<br/>\n- Maybe the concept and expectations of a Forge brand distract from the main goal?<br/>\n- Maybe there is no goal other than independent publishing?<br/>\n- If there is, what is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy goal here is not to tell you what is what. Just to be honest about my observation and propose questions to further our mutual understandings and dig deeper together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that is helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nRock,<br/>\nJohn                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64843/#Comment_64843" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T20:01:44+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  8:01PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2007 8:20PM by Graham.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I agree with Matt.

Because at that point:<br><br>1) It probably sucks in some big, perhaps unforseen ways that could be corrected if you wait a little while between having the idea and publishing the game.<br>2) More often than not, if you really want to make the game into something good, you'll have to turn right around and draft a second edition or revised edition or whatever. (see Conan RPG)<br><br>In your case, if you put more time into the game up front, there's probably really no need to go back in one year, six months, or even as your first edition hits the press to revise the game and make it into something that could have been awesome straight off the presses.<br><br>-Andy\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>This thread is making me want to start doing some critical reviewing of Indie games on my shelf. The good, the bad, the ugly -- all in all.</blockquote>\nI would love to see that, and not for the destructive glee. <br><br>I think there's a lot to be said for not wanting to speak up when your buddy releases a game that's critically flawed: It's their right to release a flawed game as they see fit: That's the Power of Indie and all that (Fugazi!!!). However, I feel bad about the fact that I can't encourage people to pick up Game X. Or if person asks "Should I buy Game X?", I'm the person who PMs or emails them saying, "No. And here's why" instead of saying it in public.  It's not a Forge Kool-Aid thing, it's a "I don't want to hurt my friend's feelings" thing.<br><br>Matt and Paul are working at something that, at it's core seems to be the kind of thing that, if someone were to enter this Ashcan Machine, be it with a CCG, a miniature game, a D&amp;D clone, or a hippy patchouli-oil smelling game, there's a much better chance that when they emerge they'll have something that people involved wouldn't hesitate to get behind.<br><br>On a personal note, I used to simply buy any game that I came across in relation to The Forge. More often than not, there was some cool ideas there and I could get a really hot gaming session or two out of it, if not run a killer campaign.  These days, though, I basically wait to buy a game until I have it in my hands and flipped through it (or read comments or hear firsthand reports from my friends), because I've gotten really burned on some spot purchases over the past two years: Games that really meant well, but needed far more work to do what the author wanted them to do. If it was an ashcan, I could have taken a big dump of a feedback/critique on it and said, "Your game is awesome, and yet, poo".  I can not do that with games that are finished and ready to purchase. I just can't. So I don't buy the game, don't say anything about it, and if I see people ask about it in public I'll whisper, PM or email them with my real opinions.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I've often thought that someone who was smart could figure out a way to create an 'indie playtesters network', that is, a lot of different gaming groups who receive compensation in some way from some kind of conglomerate to playtest games.</blockquote>\nThis is brilliant.  In fact, this is something that really should have spilled forth from The Forge, but for some reason simply has not yet. A real network of real feedbackers, with real rules, regulations, and everyone knowing up-front what they're getting into.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Hey Matt, I thought we were having a conversation. I know my last post was kinda rude, but I felt like you were being rude too. Are we going to actually discuss the issue?  ...I figure you didn't just show up to say your side and walk away.</blockquote>\nI hope not, too. I think this is an important discussion, and would love to see more dialog, and less drama. I'm hoping that people join in and continue the discussion, and put their "antagonism switch" down to "1".  OK, maybe "3" or so. EDIT: Matt responded, keeping the conversation going.

This is a step which is common if not communally mandated in any professional publishing industry, but which (unlike the ashcan stage) has never really been a part of the design cycle in the indie rpg community.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The issues of revising games, good criticism, and playtesting are important!</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI think the key message *I* got out of the discussions at Forge Midwest amounted to this:<br/>\n- What is seen as a Revision by different folks is inconsistent.  A commonly held understanding of it within the community would help everyone create a better game.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Criticism, both giving and taking; what that MEANS to both the giver and the receiver is inconsistent.  A commonly held understanding of it within the community would help everyone create a better game.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Playtesting and what that means to different people is inconsistent.  A commonly held understanding of it within the community would help everyone create a better game.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... if Playtesting, Criticism, and Revision are inconsistently understood/observed by the community at large, when someone like John says "revising games, good criticism, and playtesting are important!" everyone will nod in agreement, but <b>***none of us are thinking of the same thing.***</b>  When we say 'you need to playtest,' we should be pointing at a great guide that some genius playtesting guru has written and say "this is what we mean."  Ditto Criticism, Revision.  Further, someone who understands what Editing means in an similar industry needs to talk about how that can be brought into Indie games, to the betterment of the games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then folks look at it, and poke it with with a stick and say "yeah, that works."<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then we DON'T hold ourselves to that standard -- we help EACH OTHER hold that standard up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what I heard.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think it was a chicken little kind of situation -- there isn't a lot of screaming and running around; there's urgent and heartfelt discussion.  It's observation of a trend that's becoming more prevalent and gaining a kind of momentum that begins to define the development cycle -- any big thing with momentum behind it is going to require some concerted group effort to get it to change its direction, and most of the discussion revolved around getting people in the right places to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit to Add: Also, read Jenskot's post, because his points hit other key parts of that discussion, really well.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit to Also Add: Forge Midwest was great, if only because I now have faces for people like Matt and Jenskot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64852/#Comment_64852" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T20:54:41+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  8:54PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2007 11:02PM by Doyce.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Matt, it might be helpful if you outlined what you see as an optimal set of behaviors.

If it's only a few months after the initial release, what of the perception amongst purchasers that they are getting 'ripped off'* or otherwise bilked by having an 'improved' version of the game come out in such a short period of time? Obviously, levels of revision vary, from a few tweaks that have been identified as needing done to wholesale re-write of the product and re-assessment of the mechanics.<br><br>Actual play which contained worthwhole critique identified a couple fo areas in which Cold City could do with revision. Ironically, one of these areas was changed to their current form as a result of extensive playtesting feedback. The other is an improvement that was never identified throughout playtesting and refinement, but that appears obvious when point out by an additional third party. I think that the game is good, fucntional and playable as it stands (although I am very willing to accept further critique on this) and both of the points that came out of AP critique are improvements, rather than vital changes without which the game is unplayable.

Personally, I think that the indie community is meant to come together in order to encourage people to design games and to develop as designers.

Since I see the primary purpose of the community to be encouraging our apprentices, I worry quite a bit about applying journeyman (or master!) level standards of quality across the board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64883/#Comment_64883" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T05:37:42+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  5:37AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, when is it appropriate, to bring out a revised edition of a game?</blockquote>\nWho knows. I can't imagine there's a set time. It took me five years with one game, and about a year with another.<br><br>But, I think I'm much more interested in getting people to consider not rushing to publish that finished game in the first place, and instead pursue other avenues, whether they are more playtesting, or possibly an ashcan. Either way, a method that people who receive it understand that the game is playable, but likely needs improvement and that they, the consumer, can help provide that! <br><br>Your question is (understandably) all about existing, finished games. I'm saying we had a number of games deemed finished that probably aren't finished.

But if you do care, if you don't want to give game players and game buyers a negative perception of the quality of the games produced by your colleagues, then you should listen to what Matt is saying.<br><br>The first step is not to think about putting out a revised edition. Instead, it's to recognize that many games that were released at Gen Con at The Forge last year weren't finished games. They were ashcans. They were ashcans with pretty, perfect bound covers and polished looking layout, but ashcans still.<br><br>And don't get me wrong. This is not the first time the problem has reared its head. In 2005 we released a slew of revised editions of games, many of which had been first released in 2004.<br><br>Calling them ashcans is not meant to be derogatory. Most of the games from the early days of The Forge spent some time as ashcans. Some spent years that way. The ashcan step is a healthy part of the game design process, when you get outside criticism and playtesting.<br><br>And just to be clear, the problem is not that these games were sold. It's perfectly acceptable to sell an ashcan. Michael Miller showed us that. A number of early Forge games allowed people to buy ashcan versions of PDFs with a discount for the eventual finished game. Ashcans can be sold, given away, or just demoed, depending on your preferences.<br><br>The only caveat is that people need to know they're paying for an unfinished, unseasoned version of the game and that their feedback will help lead to a finished, polished version of the game. Once that happens all my issues vanish. I think Matt and Ron and Paul and others feel the same as well.<br><br>My suggestions:<br>1. The rush to Gen Con is proving hugely destructive, in my opinion. It's ok to slow down. It's not really ok to skip outside playtesting, outside criticism or editing in order to get it ready by Gen Con. Bring it as an aschan instead if it's not done.<br><br>2. Playtest, playtest and playtest some more. You need both in-house and blind outside playtests.<br/><br/>3. If you don't want to post your rules text online (perfectly valid), send it to picked colleagues who can provide some honest and constructive feedback.<br/><br/>4. Listen to your playtesters and critics, consider what they have to say, and make changes if you feel their comments are valid.<br/><br/>5. Hire an editor. And I don't mean a copy editor (though it would be good to have one too). Let them help you organize your text. Let them help you find text that is missing or rules that are poorly explained.<br/><br/>6. Bring your finished text to Gen Con (or not) and kick ass!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64888/#Comment_64888" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T05:48:14+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  5:48AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why are we talking about this on Story Games and not the Forge?<br/><br/>Is the implication that Story Games is somehow more responsible for this phenomenon than the Forge is?

Because at that point:<br/><br/>1) It probably sucks in some big, perhaps unforseen ways that could be corrected if you wait a little while between having the idea and publishing the game.<br/>2) More often than not, if you really want to make the game into something good, you'll have to turn right around and draft a second edition or revised edition or whatever. (see Conan RPG)<br/><br/>In your case, if you put more time into the game up front, there's probably really no need to go back in one year, six months, or even as your first edition hits the press to revise the game and make it into something that could have been awesome straight off the presses.</blockquote>\nThe difference between what you're saying and what I've been hearing is that you're talking about why non-critiqued, non-playtested etc. games are bad games and thus bad for the publisher, while Matt seems to be talking about how they're bad for The Community, because they don't uphold the high standards of awesome that people have come to expect from a 'Forge Game'.<br/><br/>The Forge is, and has always been, explicitly about the publication of indie games.  To the best of my knowledge, Story Games is not, and I hope the community at large as represented here is not.  Were I on the Forge right now, I would expect to be told what Matt et al seem to be saying.  I don't care to release a game I consider unfinished, or one which is not the best I can make it.  But any game design work I do, I do for fun, because I like tweaking rules and coming up with new half-baked ideas and throwing system around.  <br/><br/>In short, it chaps my hide to think that I am somehow responsible for 'the scene', and thinking about it that way really raises the bar in my mind.  I don't know that I even believe myself capable of producing a DitV, a Polaris, or a MLWM, or anything worthy to stand next to them.  For me, that was never really the goal.  If that's become the point of the entire indie game design community, then I have to kinda wonder what I'm doing here.  Maybe I should be wondering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64895/#Comment_64895" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T06:37:16+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  6:37AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me we've grown to the point that "indie" or "Forge game" as a brand has become useless.

I don't think that's indie related, I think that holds for most games unless there's some obvious terrible error a la first ed Conan that means the original game was fundamentally flawed.<br/><br/>I think also that it is a success of the indie gaming scene that Forge game is no longer a badge of quality, that sounds backwards, but what it means is that the volume of creation is now such that one can't simply assume the same small bunch of guys have created it after discussing it between themselves.  I don't really see that as a bad thing, I think the Forge brand will suffer but I don't think it was ever intended that there be a Forge brand so I'm not sure that's a bad thing either.<br/><br/>Otherwise, is there an absence of criticism?  I thought that was what the Forge was for?  Storygames is a chat and generally pleasant hangout forum, if I were designing a game I wouldn't expect criticism here, I'd go elsewhere for that.<br/><br/>But yeah, lots of indie games ain't that great (edit, as in many aren't that good, not as in having lots of them is a bad thing), that's because there's far more of them than there used to be.  That said, I have to admit I see no real criticism, in part I suspect because when people see issues they simply don't post at all.  Round here things tend to the "if you have nothing nice to say say nothing school of thought", whether that's a problem depends in part on whether the Forge is filling that critical niche and that I don't know as I don't currently post there (too much traffic on the actual play fora for me to keep track more than anything else).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64911/#Comment_64911" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T07:32:13+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  7:32AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought two games at Gen Con: Shock: and Agon. I really dig them. With access to Joshua and John, or access to threads on how to play the games, I think they both become great games. With only the texts, they're problematic at best. A little more playtesting and a little more editing would have done wonders for both texts.<br/><br/>Does that make Joshua and John bad people? No! Does it make them bad game designers? No! The games are great. It's just that their texts need a little more finishing.<br/><br/>I think the same holds true for Mortal Coil. Many of the issues people have had with Mortal Coil were issues my group had with it during playtesting. I'm sure others can hold up different games as examples. I'm only using these three because they're the ones with which I have direct experience with the texts.<br/><br/>This isn't about calling Story Games or Knife Fight or The Forge or RPGnet or any other community to the carpet. It's not about calling specific designers to the carpet either.<br/><br/>This is something that affects the community of designers, players, fans and playtesters. The community of The Forge--and hopefully the diaspora, by extension--was built on the spirit of mutualism and respect. You don't have to feel responsible to the community. That's your choice and that's ok. But if you do feel responsible to the community, consider the stuff that I'm saying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64912/#Comment_64912" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T07:32:28+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  7:32AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2007 7:49AM by Colin_Fredericks.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, you know what I'd like to see?<br/><br/>People, whom I do not know personally, willing to playtest and critique my games.

I'm also not planning to release perfect products. I'm planning to do the best I can at the time,in the same way that an apprentice or (I flatter myself) journeyman craftsman of any sort would follow his current skill and knowledge of his craft with diligence and patience, finish a work-piece and start the next.<br/><br/>Capes is imperfect in ways that I now know in excruciating detail. I could revise it, but I'm not gonna. Misery Bubblegum will not be imperfect in those same ways (though it will, doubtless, be imperfect in others).<br/><br/>I will continue to create and develop, leaving a string of my previous works behind me for all the world to see and to scorn.<br/><br/><b>Whether this makes me a good member of the community or a bad one sort of depends upon what you think the community is meant to be doing. If you think that the indie community is meant to gather together to help each of us to achieve commercial success and to maintain a level of consistent and reliable quality then my attitude is selfish in the extreme. Personally, I think that the indie community is meant to come together in order to encourage people to design games and to develop as designers. In that context, I feel pretty good about my decision, and I feel pretty skeptical about a "don't release until it's perfect" attitude.</b><br/><br/>I think constructive criticism and editing is absolutely a great resource for helping a craftsman to develop, but I think it is very easy for it to go beyond where it's helping people develop, and into where it is hurting their ability to do so (roughly, "If the best game you can make right now would make indie games look bad then do not make a game"). Since I see the primary purpose of the community to be encouraging our apprentices, I worry quite a bit about applying journeyman (or master!) level standards of quality across the board.</blockquote>\nWhat is the indie community in this specific context?<br/><br/>- Games that come out of the Forge?<br/>- Games sold at the Forge booth?<br/>- Something else?<br/><br/>What is that community's goal(s)?<br/><br/>- encourage designers to develop as designers<br/>- maintain a level of consistent and reliable quality<br/>- independent publishing of products<br/>- commercial success<br/><br/>I think the answers change depending on the context. <br/><br/>If the indie community in this context is games sold at the Forge booth, then as a customer my hope is that one of the goals is to maintain a level of consistent and reliable quality. <br/><br/>If the indie community in this context is games that come out of the Forge, that may not even be published, then as someone who appreciates creativity and loves RPGs, my hope is that one of the goals is to encourage designers to develop as designers. <br/><br/>I want more games! In any form! These communities are amazing breeding grounds for innovation and creativity. The ideas can come in any format. It could be a PDF, it could be a TXT file, it could just be a forum post. I don't want to ever loose site of that do it yourself attitude. And I don't think commerce needs to be the driving force here. But when I go to a booth at Gencon, I expect certain things as a customer. And it confuses me when I see games with pretty covers and art but with unedited text and rules that haven't been fully playtested. Why release this as a product? Why not just make it a PDF? Why not give it for free? Even so, the game developer doesn't owe me anything. As a customer, it is my choice to buy.

I also don't think it's a complete mess, because a number of people have successfully played it without hitting the web sites. Could it be better? Hell, yeah. Do I regret publishing it? Hell, no.<br/><br/>My goal is to continually improve. I don't want to put a game out there as fully published that is unplayable as written, but I also know that waiting for perfect means never publishing. You've got to strike a balance, and your goal should be that each time you publish a game, it improves on the mistakes you made in the last.<br/><br/>Do I think the rush to publish at GenCon hurts games? Definitely. I was hoping to release my new game for GenCon this year, but it isn't ready. I would rather wait and publish when it is fully baked than rush it for the GenCon release.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64956/#Comment_64956" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T09:07:32+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  9:07AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Max and John's comments made me think of something.</p>\n<p>Yes, there has been an ongoing issue with games that people don't fully understand until they've read additional material online, possibly even asked the designer directly. There have been too many such questions about Sorcerer to exempt it, and there have been other games with the same issues. Maybe those games should have included a FAQ chapter based on questions that actually kept popping up? Who knows. That's not my main point.</p>\n<p>My point is actually this: the older design crowd did some of the same things, at least in terms of editing or providing complete information, and now they're claiming about the same sorts of behavior in a younger design crowd. And what's more: other than complaining, they aren't doing anything about it.</p>\n<p>I only visit the Forge on rare occasions, anymore. For the last full year that I was a regular participant, what I saw was: a lot of newer faces offering up their fledgling game designs and asking for help, coupled with reduced participation by the established designers. The only help they received was from each other, from people just as inexperienced as they. And on the rare occasions I go back to the Forge and check the First Thoughts or Play Test forums, I see that nothing has changed.</p>\n<p>So, maybe people who frequent the Forge are publishing games before they are ready, and that bothers more experienced designers. But when the fledglings asked "Is my game ready?" where were those experienced designers? And if those experienced designers are seeing the Forge brand diluted by new unfinished games being sold at the Forge booth, where were they when it came time to decide which games to sell? Or, if the decision on which games to sell was based solely on cash, why complain now?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64960/#Comment_64960" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T09:15:44+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  9:15AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br/><br/>I'd nominate my games through DL-Quarterly as short of polished.  If I had known the word Ashcan back when I started, that's what I would have called them.  I never claimed they were polished, professional and finished games, but I'm not sure I ever said they were beta either.  I should have.  I want people to look at DL-Quarterly as a process.  They get fun, functional games at a low price (relatively speaking).  They also get to have their feedback matter if/when a revised version comes out.  I hope that this model can be something functional for people beyond myself.  As a first time designer, I'm nearly postive that my first try at game design will not be the best I can do.  I imagine many others are in that same boat.  I don't see anything wrong with offering games for sale, even nice color covered perfect boung games, as ashcans and accepting critical and harsh feedback.  In fact I expect it.  Others, who view themselves as part of a community, should too.  I plan to make it part of my production cycle.  People who view themselves as solo individuals when it comes to game design, well...then I don't see how any of this would really apply to you.

Hopefully no one puts me on a kill-list for using these examples to make the points I made elsewhere already.<br/><br/><b>Games I fucking Love that I think could be better with (in the example I was speaking to at that moment) a third party editor</b><br/>In that part of the discussion, I specifically mentioned Shadow of Yesterday and Conspiracy of Shadows.  Everyone with eyes and an account on either the Forge or Story Games knows I love TSoY, and I'm running a CoS game right now as well and like it a whole lot -- hell, Keith was in the room when I used the example.  In TSoY's case, I feel that every word in the book is great, but that the organization is not optimized for in-game reference, or for good learning.  I write and edit teaching texts, so I feel justified in that critique.  I said essentially the same thing about CoS, with the additional mention that a straight copyeditor would be a benefit.   There are certain elements of the rules that you shouldn't have to search for in a game text -- you should almost be able to let your hand fall on the open text before you, knowing it will land on that bit.<br/><br/><b>Games I love that I think could be better with either a revision or (in hindsight) an initial ashcan edition</b><br/>Mortal Coil was an example I used.  I love the game, and I'm GMing it with a glad heart, and I'd love to play it, but I also know that I as the GM need to come to the game ready to cover for issues that will arise in play -- things that, reading AP and Playtest feedback, have been there awhile.  I think it's got a core of greatness and some pretty rough holes.  Brennan's been addressing that stuff as it arises on the forums or in AP (his increasingly-more-complicated conflict examples thread on the Forge, though not done according to him, should, IMO be a standard inclusion in every game), but yeah, that stuff should be in a revision.  Should he not have published?  Of course not.  Could it have benefited from an ashcan version last year that became a slightly thicker pretty version this year?  Yes.  Brennan's said as much up above.  He knows I really really like his game, I hope.<br/><br/>I'm also going to man up and shoot a sacred cow and say that in my experience, the Mountain Witch is an elegant, beautiful game that, while gorgeously lean, could use more beef in the form of conflict examples (involving every fucking possible screwed up complicated permutation Tim can come up with).  "A dozen more" would be a good starting place.<br/><br/>I mean... Primetime Adventures had revised edition -- so did Dogs (I have copies of both versions, and there's stuff in Afraid I wish were IN Dogs) -- it's not like even the best indie stuff hasn't been made better.  Perfect? No. None of it's perfect. Nothing is perfect.  "More done?" yes.<br/><br/><b>Games that require an internet connection and/or the author's email to really get humming</b><br/>Note: I'm not saying "to get to run at all," I'm saying "to do it 'right'."  I went old school for this particular discussion and said Sorcerer.  Again, anyone who's read any of my AP knows I love that game, but come on: do you really think I built the SorcererWiki that forms the core of Random Average out of love? That was necessity all the way. I needed to compile that stuff (four years of rules explanations) to really feel like I got that game well enough to do it justice.  I'm a good GM who gets most things, and I felt I needed that help.  If you are someone who can play Capes, I feel Capes would be in this category.<br/><br/><b>Games that require an internet connection and/or the author's email to really get running</b><br/>Capes (for me).  I've read everything I can on the game, gone through the basic rules and the (brilliant) flash walkthrough (twice, in that case) and I still don't think I could either GM or play it, and I'm smart enough that that shouldn't happen.<br/><br/>Final note: You won't find me using examples like Agon or Perfect or (reads back into the thread) Shock:, because I haven't played them or run them.  The examples I used I've experienced directly and used as examples for that reason.  I've studiously avoided (and will continue to do so) using any games where the feedback I have on their current finished state (or lack thereof) is third-hand.<br/><br/>Yes, the whole list is subjective.  As I am not polling the entire indie playerbase, it could not be otherwise.<br/><br/>No, I'm not calling any of these games on the carpet.  Someone asked what games people were mentioning, so I answered that on my own behalf, to remove any haze of miscommunication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64974/#Comment_64974" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T09:53:18+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  9:53AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My question is about addressing the problem.<br/><br/>Frankly, uh, Story Games is not primarily a design community, so calling it a failed design community is a category error.

I <b>really</b> appreciate this honesty, but this is so far from my perception of Agon (and the perception of my trusted peers, players, editors, and customers) that I'm at a loss. I am hugely proud of Agon. I'll hold it up to any published game in terms of clarity, completeness, and readiness to play right out of the box.<br/><br/>I know I sound like the defensive designer here, which sucks, but I'm willing to risk it. I'm a member of the community who is constantly striving to improve as a designer and writer, and I care a lot about the indie community standards of quality. I would not have published Agon if I thought it was half-baked.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's perfect, of course. Sure, there are a couple of mechanics that, in hindsight, could be better tuned. And there are probably bits of writing that could be improved. But that is a far cry from "problematic at best,", IMO. Agon is a solid, playable, good game. I stand by it.<br/><br/>I guess I'm just trying to dial in how your judgment of the game is so different from mine. If I have such a huge blindspot for my own work (and everyone I trust as a reviewer and peer has it too) then I really want to get to the bottom of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64983/#Comment_64983" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T10:05:29+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 10:05AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2007 10:06AM by Ben_Lehman.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, that's true.<br/><br/>I just think that unless we're willing to put serious effort and work into reforming the Forge community, its hyperfocus on GenCon, and its decided focus towards monetary success, we're not going to be able to fix the problem.  I also don't think that Story Games is a great place to reform the Forge.<br/><br/>I've seen people attacking knife-fight and Story Games (and maybe other forums) for their perceived fault in this problem.  I have not heard a peep about, or on, the Forge.  Which, given that it's the center of design activity, seems strange.<br/><br/>To those of you who might say "start a thread on a the Forge" I'm working on writing it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64990/#Comment_64990" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T10:22:01+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 10:22AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's lots to respond to, so bear with:<br/><br/><strong>The Forge Brand</strong><br/>I'm going to stand with the folks saying the Forge Brand is dead.  It's functionally useless, it does not describe anything about the products, it has zero quality control or barrier to entry.  Now, to be fair, Forge Brand was never anything formal or intended; it sort of just happened, and it was useful and reliable for a few years and now it's not.  I don't think we should expect anything more from an accident of game design history.  We can, however, learn from it and try to intentionally build brands to do what Forge Brand used to do.  This might mean your own personal brand; it may mean something like the Collective Endeavor brand; it may mean something informal like the Those Guys In Masachusetts brand.  This is where we can take a cue from Luke, who used Forge Brand as a springboard for launching his own brand, complete with little three-quarter wheel on fire.<br/><br/><strong>Half-Baked Games</strong><br/>This is a problem, yes.  It is not, however, a new problem.  As with many things indie, Sorcerer is a prime example.  The forum threads explaining how to play the game that you already bought the book for are well-known.  There are multiple supplements that continually refine what Sorcerer "is."  Ron has repeatedly said he has no plans on compiling those volumes together or releasing a revised edition.  Now, from what I understand Ron is following a slightly different publishing model akin to academic publishing, where each book is an artifact of his thinking on gaming at the time.  (Correct me if I'm wrong, Ron!)  That's all well and good, and has some pretty potent advantages for the gaming community as a whole, as it lays out the practice of roleplaying and the developing thought on it and encourages readers to participate in that development.  But it also directly conflicts with this aesthetic of a game book that you can buy, read, and play without any other participation.<br/><br/>In this thread, Tony has espoused a similar publishing aesthetic: the old games are there as signposts and the new games will be better than the old games.  Or on the other hand, there have always been unfinished games at the Forge.  Shatterzone, for instance, or 1984 Prime.  I believe the former is dead but the latter is being revised, which is awesome.  But the point is: this is not new.  We should not expect indie games to be miraculously exempt from Sturgeon's Law -- especially since indie games are defined by their lack of gatekeepers and their standards.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that there's nothing to be done, of course.<br/><br/><strong>Playtesting, Ashcans, and Editors</strong><br/>There are in fact many things to be done, and none of them are a magic bullet.  "We need more playtesting" is like saying "The world needs more good people."  While there is such a thing as too much playtesting, it's really really hard to get there.  To my mind, there are two sides to the playtesting need: quantity and quality.  It is very hard to get both.  From my own experience, <em>FLFS</em> had a lot of playtesting but I received little actionable feedback.  (This was not, as I told myself on occasion, because I was just that awesome and didn't need revisions.)  With my later games, playtests have point-by-point guides on what needs thorough playtesting and what I'd like to hear back about.  SoL may have a freaking <em>form</em> to fill out.  This is not because I know everything that needs to be addressed, but because multiple, specific questions provoke people to think and develop their own understanding of their experiences -- and it's that understanding that I need, not "X was neat, but Y was kind of boring."  I also have an absolutely awesome weekly playtest circle, more on which later.<br/><br/>I am intrigued by the ashcan thing.  I am avidly watching this experiment, and have high hopes that it will develop neat new strategies to address the playtesting issue.  My biggest concern right now, though, is one of volume: we already have more games than playgroups.  If every game being developed goes through this ashcan stage, it seems to me we will see the same glut in ashcans that we saw in the "finished" books at the last GenCon booth.  So: I await the Ashcan Front's results.<br/><br/>Beyond playtesting and revising the game design, jehosaphat do some of these games need some significant editorial work.  To clarify: not "you have a dangling participle" but "the order in which you present these topics does not aid comprehension" and "the structure of the book is counter-intuitive."  There is this really big step between "functioning game design described in a word document" to "physical book to be sold as a product" that a lot of games gloss over.  This is a <em>completely different</em> step than playtesting, and I've seen many many designers conflate the two.  The obvious solution is to hire editors, but to be perfectly honest I don't see this happening in indie games.  That directly conflicts with the low-overhead DIY ethic of this community.  I do not know what can "fix" this issue.<br/><br/><strong>Playtesting Network</strong><br/>Somebody mentioned setting up a playtesting network or conglomerate.  I am incredibly lucky to participate in a weekly playtest circle in Los Angeles.  We have four designers and two just-players-(so-far), and about ten projects between the lot of us.  That means that, just on our own, we usually have something to play/test/beat with a stick every week.  However, we can and have traded playtests with other designers outside of our circle.  The arrangement is simple: we'll playtest yours if you playtest ours.  While we have the significant advantage of living in a major urban center, it really was not very difficult setting our group up, and I totally believe that it can be replicated elsewhere.  Enough of these groups trading playtests back and forth would be a pretty potent playtesting network.<br/><br/>I'll reign myself in, here, but I think the jist of my point is thus: there is not, has never been, and never will be quality control for indie games.  There can be, however, quality control of individual games and individual brands, and my money is on creating <em>that</em>.  Doing it "for the community" is not going to work as long as "the community" has an open door.  That's just a pyramid scheme.  Quality control is about sustainability, and the first step for sustainability is in limiting what needs to be maintained.  Once you do that, quality control is easily within reach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64995/#Comment_64995" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T10:32:06+00:00" title="April 24, 2007 10:32AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>There's lots to respond to, so bear with:<br/>Beyond playtesting and revising the game design, jehosaphat do some of these games need some significant editorial work.

Two big reasons are that I did read the text online before buying it, and that I got the revised edition. I'm of the opinion that the first edition mechanics are rather, err, lackluster -- there's just something about them that doesn't really click for me; if I had bought the old edition <i>without being able to read it online and know what I was getting</i> first, I would have probably been rather disappointed in the final product. Fortunately for me, I only got it this year, so it's the swanky revised edition instead. (The best thing about Clinton's use of the Creative Commons is that it lets you see exactly what you're getting, and he's got a product that's good enough that seeing what you're getting doesn't actually hurt. I really think he could sell a few more copies if he made the CC text a little fancier and more accessible.)<br/><br/><i>Sorcerer</i>, to me, is inaccessible. I think the book is put together very nicely, but, just reading it, I don't understand <i>how</i> it's supposed to be different from a game of, say, <i>Mage</i> (maybe the problem is that I've never read <i>Mage</i> in detail): like, okay, I get the thematic differences in the way magic is represented, but, looking at the book, I don't actually understand how Ron's mechanics are supposed to produce fundamentally different play. And then I read stuff on the Internet and the game makes a hell of a lot more sense, and is <b>TEN TIMES COOLER</b>, though I'm still left a little bit wanting, as there seem to be a few super-cool scene-framing things that everyone alludes to but that I can't find in the text.<br/><br/><i>The Riddle of Steel</i> was the first non-mainstream game I played. As far as the story-game-ish side of it, the book really doesn't show you the full potential of the Spiritual Attribute mechanics (though putting in Ron's little page about how SAs work with sorcery did a lot of good). Also, the combat system is really cool, but I'm someone who hasn't done ARMA or SCA or any other kind of combat with European swords: the game does a good job of depicting Renaissance-ish sword-fighting, but I needed an expansion book (<i>The Flower of Battle</i>) to figure out what Renaissance-ish sword-fighting was supposed to be like in the first place (surprisingly, that book is like 50% pictures of weapons, but I really liked it because it helped me get a much better picture of how European armor and weaponry worked, which was something I could take away from the game even if I wasn't playing <i>Riddle</i> anymore). I really feel like the game's skill and magic systems could have use a whole lot more playtesting -- the way they were put together in the book really made it seem like they were just cobbled-together around a combat engine rather than developed to work with it specifically. There's a lot of stuff that better editing could've greatly improved, like grammar issues. I'm also convinced that more fresh eyes looking at the combat charts could've helped find a new format for them (there are several online that are far superior to the ones in the book), and that a dedicated third-party editor could've convinced Jake (the core book author) to change the tone, which I found horribly grating whenever the book turned to how it was different form "other games" (i.e. D&amp;D).<br/><br/>I think <i>Polaris</i> is a great example of a game that really feels, err, finished. For the most part, it's a very polished text. I think Ben really lucked out on the art, too. My one complaint is the appendices: given the careful style being cultivated throughout, a few of the star names really should've been cut -- X-with-some-number doesn't fit in at all. This is a really, really minor bit, which is why I point it out in the first place. (Incidentally, the thing that would really elevate the text to pretty much perfection would be an appendix of some cool demon names to play around with, because I read "Lord Long Summer" and was just blown away by the coolness of that name, and I'm sure Ben has many more awesome names like that in him. And maybe another half-page on how to use the negotiation mechanics.)<br/><br/><br/>Incidentally, I don't think indie games are really doing badly on this front. There are definitely mainstream products with similar editing issues. Many RPG supplements and splatbooks don't get any playtesting at all (whether true or not, this seems to be a common criticism of D&amp;D and Exalted splats). And I can find good examples of serious issues in video games, too (<i>Bloodlines</i>, for example, has some real gold in it but also has some poor mechanics and is quite buggy; <i>Knights of the Old Republic 2</i> is deeply unsatisfying because it was rushed, forcing the writers to end a good game in a really worthless way). And the lesson from the video game industry is definitely that games that absolutely rock right out of the box are better than games that have a lot of potential but need three patches before they are really stable and playable (though the other lesson is that no game can be perfect right out of the box, of course).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

People seem to be hearing; your game needs to be perfect, or you need to march to our creative drum. This is not what's being said. What's being said is, "releasing broken games is bad." It's bad for you, it's bad for the other folks trying to sell games with you at Gen Con. Ash Can's are a way to find people outside your circle to find those points that you have unconsciously fixed by what you do at the table, and that you have transmitted to your playtestors. I'm not a designer, I'm trying but it has yet to be determined if I'll make it. I am however a consumer of Indy games.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt last years Gen Con, I arrived excited. I had been introduced to games that delivered on play I enjoyed. I had never enjoyed a con before Forge Midwest earlier that year. My experience had been most people don't know how to have fun playing games because they were too concerned about plot, and trying to make roleplaying into writing. I had stopped purchasing games, because I literally already own hundreds, and games in the game store were just more of the same. I had stopped roleplaying. Indie games revitalized me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went wild. Like a starving man. I bought 24 games for the Forge/Wicked Dead booth. I spent $400 to $500, around 2 to 3% of my yearly income. I say this not to try to cause guilt but to point to my excitement. I trusted the games would be up to the standards of the games I'd already encountered. Many of them have been glanced over and are things that I'm likely to read to absorb the ideas, but most I don't see playing. There were two games I wanted because of the buzz on various podcasts. Burning Empires and Mortal Coil. I haven't played with Burning Empires enough to offer criticism, but I'm fairly confident it stands on good ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nMortal Coil is the game I've most run and played since then, but I've played it like traditional games. What I mean is there is no way to play it as written. It's broken. The rule based portion of the game is fucking amazing, absolutely fucking brilliant. It delivers me engaged players like I've never experienced, at a table. Normal people, not folks who spend lots of time on RPG sites. People I'm trying to convince at cons that these games are worthy. I can see the crust start to fall off their eyes, and their excitement. Then the resolution system and my inability to puzzle out it's workings and strategies through multiple readings, and talking to friends who are into the game, drops us down. I have to fall back on GM as decider because the game doesn't work, and it puts a bad taste in my mouth. To expect me to have to go search for some forums somewhere to puzzle through some boring Actual Play post is not acceptable. Not for a product being presented as finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I caught the tail end of Brennan running the Flaming Taft game that the folks involved... treasure. In his hands it seems to do wonders. That's the kind of game experience I want, and the game actually starts to deliver until we get to resolving conflict. What the game has actually delivered is some games that worked because I found ways to let people get what they wanted from a scene, and others that failed horribly in actual frustration and anger from the participants. Kind of like those games I used to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what folks were talking about, and it's not a new conversation, as I was having it with my local friends in September as I started to work through the games I bought and scratch my head. It also means this year I'll be much more guarded in my purchases at Gen Con, and that is bad for you, whether your artist integrity remains or not. Having a motivated buyer turn into a guarded buyer is not good for your bottom line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65152/#Comment_65152" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T16:25:38+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  4:25PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, Clyde.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65159/#Comment_65159" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T17:32:10+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  5:32PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Clyde.

I love the game. I love it's potential, and I specifically chose it to address as it's a perfect example of something that would have benefited if the Ash Can Front existed last year. It's why it was getting discussed at Forge Midwest, that and probably because you weren't there. It appears that within the Indie community theres a fear to be honest, because people worry about burning bridges. I don't blame you. I understand the pressure you must have felt to get done by Gen Con. It's totally understandable. If you make a new version that expresses better how the resolution system works, I will buy it.

That first attempt that's the best you can do, can thrive and get better by getting involved in the Ash Can process. The idea is it's there for the learning. The advantage it gives the community is that it allows folks to clearly mark games they feel are finished as finished, and games they are still not satisfied with as Ash Cans. This delineation is useful and in no way stops some one from taking the steps of learning through publishing. The Ash Can Front is publishing. This delineation also helps the market, as it helps generate trust in customers, that they know what they are getting when they turn their hard earned money over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65169/#Comment_65169" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T19:18:27+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  7:18PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will add one thing for now and mention that it's weird how the SG gestalt picks up on my brain patterns.

"contents are sold as-is, no guarantee of quality is implied, nor should any be inferred."<br><br>Publishing that is <i>one</i> experience.  It will teach you some things.  Publishing a book where you say "I think this is worth you paying attention to, and if you think it's crap then I'm okay with you judging me harshly as a result," is <i>another</i> experience.  It will teach you some different things.<br><br>I think it is vitally important to help people take the first step into that harsh light of standing behind your imperfect product and accepting that it has flaws, that they're your fault, and that they're important (to at least some people).  That's not an easy thing to do, but it is the <i>sine qua non</i> of independent publishing: the confidence (or arrogance, if you prefer) to present your own brain-child as being the same type of thing as the works you admire.<br><br/>I think the dichotomy here is very real:  If you are recommending that people who have doubts stick to the ash-can format then you are, <i>de facto</i>, recommending that many people never publish outside of that format.  Some people will always have doubts; it's how they're wired.

There's really no need to be. Accept feedback and criticism with a nod of your head and a "thank" you on your lips. No matter what forum or form it's presented in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur games are imperfect. They always have been, always will be. Dogs, Sorcerer, Inspectres, etc. All the leading lights are flawed. That's fine. But that doesn't mean they can't be better -- and that we can't learn going forward. That doesn't mean that "try your hardest as best you can in the beginning even if what you're going to do sucks" can't including playtesting, editing, and proofreading. These are three basic steps for being a self-published game designer and author. You have to wear all of the hats and you have to also realize when your unique genius isn't enough. None of us have the unique genius to design, write, test, edit and publish a decent game all by ourselves. Not Ron, not Jared, not Paul, not Vincent and certainly not me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMatt and Thor aren't even talking about <i>quality</i> of design or even clarity of writing. Sometimes, you just don't grok a game. It happens. But some games, even if you don't get them, are clearly tested concepts. Ron had a prototype of Sorcerer years before he published. Jared was publishing Inspectres on the internet for free before he made his little coil-bound booklets. Paul ran a semi-private playtest group that posted results and questions for My Life in a special forum at the Forge. Vincent did a similar thing for Dogs -- though I'll submit that Dogs was well conceived, but rushed out the door. And I spent years mocking up and revising BW before any of you ever saw the stupid thing (and it STILL sucked when I published it).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice is to focus on your designs a bit more. A good game lives a long time. There's no need to bang out a new-cool design every few months or even once a year. The process of design and self-publishing is lengthy and there <i>is</i> a right way to go about it. To wit: Conceive, test, write, test, write, edit, test, edit, layout, edit, publish. Or thereabouts.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't respond to me directly, I can't get back in a timely manner. I'm at GAMA pimping your broke-ass games.<br/>\n<br/>\n-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Probably because of the tone I've been posting in, so ... my bad.<br/><br/>I wish I'd done more external playtests on <i>Capes</i>.  It would have been a blessing to me to have somebody say, <i>specifically</i>, "This game you've got, it's good when you're playing it, but are you absolutely certain that you've unpacked everything that happens when you're there and explained it all in the rules?"  That woulda helped me.  I might not have listened, but even if I'd ignored the advice it would have given me some additional motivational shame to learn the lesson post-publishing :-)  So I'm certainly not against external playtests, and I'm not against giving people advice on an individual basis.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is that across-the-board advice is very tricky to give.  "Have external playtests" ... that's advice so solid that I might recommend it for any developer.  But "Don't publish until you're sure you're ready" is definitely <b>not</b> advice that I would give across the board.<br/><br/>I suspect that my unfortunate shift toward a "shoot from the hip" posting tone here has made people feel that I'm much more averse to ashcans than I am.

Your game will be incomprehensible to them and they will feel like shit every second they try to play it. This is not a result of your game design, it is a result of the law of big numbers.  <br/><br/>For an example, look at Balbinus and those 1990s AEG games. "You go to hell, Balbinus, those games were good!!" <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Obviously you want your game to be hated by as few people as possible. So it's easy to take criticism and go "well, maybe I should have changed this" or even listen to calls that a game should have stayed in development longer (ashcans, playtesting, editing, whatever). <br/><br/>But if you publish a truly shitty game, don't worry, 1) it's not like nobody has ever published a shitty game before, and 2) the law of big numbers is a shield as well as a sword - someone out there will love it.<br/><br/>If someone is crying because your shitty game is on a shelf next to their awesome game, it's their fault for picking that shelf.  Next time your game will be awesome and their game will be shitty.  And - law of big numbers - the opinions the two of you have about your two games may not be backed up by others.<br/><br/>As a consumer, I am completely uncaring about your aches and pains as a designer. I thought Sorcerer was decent, solid work, and I didn't have to read any threads about it at all. In fact when I read the threads I laughed at the things people - including the designer - said about the game.<br/><br/>In fact, I'd go so far as to say that most of what designers think about their games is totally worthless bullshit. You will never know what part of your game is great and what part sucks, even after someone tells you.  You're too close to it. You'll never play it with an open mind. You'll never try to puzzle out how it works. You'll never have to decide whether you like it or not.  <br/><br/>The designer is dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65285/#Comment_65285" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T09:19:17+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  9:19AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2007 9:19AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, Jason, once again you point out your wonderful perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the thread is about the design process, can you be a bit more clear on what your perspective means for the designer?

Give it to some folk not connected with your playgroup.  Do not answer their query emails on what to do with it.  Ask them how actual play went and what happened in it.<br><br>This is how Cumberland Games does its playtesting, no queries are answered during the playtest, because the eventual consumer may not be able to ask S John Ross questions.  The game is what it is, he often finds so he once told me that people find stuff that he never thought of and fall over things that never struck him as difficult.  They interpret rules in ways he never dreamt of, find cool stuff he didn't even know he'd written. <br/><br/>I think you're taking that as the designer is dead, I disagree, I take it as indicating that playtesting is critical for the designer to understand if they are communicating their intent.<br/><br/>So, that test, "you need people to consistently be able to sit down and play your game out of the box, without help, without you available as an unpublished supplement" I think is a rock solid test that if applied by the designer will lead to a better finished product.  Is it always practical?  I don't know, but I think it's a goal I would strongly recommend people aim for.<br/><br/>Once your game is out, sure, I'll bend, fold and mutilate it.

And that covers everything -- an hour spent rereading examples and asking questions on forums in order to figure out an obtuse rule is just as bad as an hour spent tinkering with a house-rule fix for a broken rule.<br/><br/>Incidentally, that does mean I'm much more forgiving of a free game than I am of a $20 game, and I'm much more forgiving of a $20 game than a $35 game. Unfortunately, a lot of TRPG player culture seems to work the other way around: lots of people seem to be <i>more</i> willing to spend countless hours applying remedial fixes to a ruleset they've put $100-500 than they are willing to spend patching a freebie game. While I do understand the DIY ethic, I'm still calling that "unfortunate" because it means the companies pushing out the big lines often have fairly little incentive to make their games awesome, beyond the need to hook customers onto the line in the first place. (Of course, I did this for a long time myself. Now I look at all the money and time I wasted as "sunk costs" rather than an "investment.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65316/#Comment_65316" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T11:39:10+00:00" title="April 25, 2007 11:39AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2007 11:46AM by JDCorley.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Balbinus got the point I was trying to make perfectly, yep. <br/><br/>Once a game is in a consumer's hands, the designer is dead. You only live until you publish. Then you are dead and nothing you think about your game matters anymore, if it ever did. That is why 'no-assistance playtests' to a highly diverse population are so vital. I must emphasize the 'highly diverse population' too. People with a lot of different preferences and a lot of different approaches to the material of your game exist out there. Some of them will hate you in the end. You're trying to minimize that number. One of them may end up being a fellow game designer who doesn't want their stuff on the same shelf with yours. It's a waste of time trying to figure out whether they're right or wrong about your game.

Got it. Been advocating that for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of "diverse" groups, to quote John Wick on the subject, "A game hasn't really been playtested until you put it in front of stupid people."<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich segues nicely into point the second, which is to make the game playable out of the box as the end goal of said playtesting. Again, that's always been good advice. I've admonished the Game Chef designers time and again that if they think they should publish their work coming out of the contest without further development that they're crazy. That includes the winners, who, theoretically at least, have the "most complete game." "Most Complete" in this context means, "probably needs the least amount of rewriting before it can be sent to start playtesting."<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that everyone, but everyone actually understands this. Do they always follow through? No, many people do rush. But they do so, I think, because it's just very tempting to throw a game out there and see if it happens to work. To make the buying public your playtesters for the second edition. Worse it's a subjective line to draw at times. How much playtesting is enough? When am I delaying because I'm being a perfectionist? When is it "good enough?"<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you say, Jason, these are particularly hard decisions to make when you're the designer and so close to the material. Of course it always seems like it works to the designer - he's interpreting it the way he hopes everyone will (but well may not).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs that an excuse? No. But the point is that I don't think that we have to hammer these principles into folks more than we have. I think that far more helpful is working with people on their designs (including doing playtesting), and giving them the feedback to say, "No, this one isn't ready yet." As Tony said above, nobody told him that Capes needed more work. I think that often the issue is that the designer isn't getting feedback on the design, and moves to publish simply because there's no other way to get feedback. Or, sans feedback saying otherwise, the designer starts to suspect that it is, in fact, ready.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice, me simply saying "help more," isn't going to do anything. The point being that some designers will still not get as much support as others (whether because of bad luck, or lack of hustle on the designers part), and these mistakes will continue to be made. I agree with you, Jason, that complaining that some game isn't fully-baked after the fact is pointless, especially if the person complaining didn't help with the design. If you actually told the designer that he needed to do more work after a playtest or something, then I think you have a leg to stand on. But not until then.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople will always make bad games, no matter where they're designing them. I think designers have to focus on their own standards and work hard to get it right, and not worry so much about other people's standards. After all, if you do a better job with finishing the design, you'll have the better game. So...<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I guess I'm a little Darwinian about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65421/#Comment_65421" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T06:43:26+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  6:43AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2007 6:47AM by timfire.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Do independent playtesting.

The lesson I learned form developing/publishing The Mountain Witch was that the way you make a game "work" is through explaining the game text... More specifically, games don't work on rules alone, they require very specific "soft" play techniques. If you don't (or can't) communicate these techniques through explanation/advice text, people won't "get" your game. I actually consider the writing/explaining to be, oh, 60% or so of design. Yep, I consider actual rules development to really only comprise, maybe 30% of a "finished" game. Beta testing, in my mind, is more about developing your advice and explanations than it is about the rules.<br><br>[edit] And you can only develop your explanations/advice by being forced to explain yourself 6-12 times to people who just don't get it. You really need a significant number of beta-type playtesters. [/edit] Finding beta/independent playtesters is difficult, though, and that's where the ashcan thing comes in. Forcing people to spend money encourages buy-in.<br><br>But I think there's another issue at work here. People design much more privately than they use to. This encourages the illusion that a design or text is "finished". I believe the more open design you use to see at the Forge would fill in alot of the holes of a design/text similar to beta-testing. Because of the more open attitude of the past, beta-playtesting as a discrete stage was probably less crucial than it is today.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div

I know I stopped posting to the Forge with my own designs because I got tired of having fifteen people respond and ignoring fourteen of them.  I like to think this isn't me being an arrogant ass: I got tired of feedback advising me to have a longer skill list, or suggesting various ways to make my game more mainstream and less innovative, because innovative was unfamiliar.<br/><br/>Also, we're starting to develop face-to-face meetups and communities of practice that are <em>far</em> more effective at giving feedback (especially initial feedback) than online fora.

Not for any good reason, but simply that it became untennable to help everyone due to volume. It feels bad when you help one person, but don't have time to help another. So I don't help half as many people any more. It's easier in more than one way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want that sort of quality back again, you need a small place to start a new community. Can't be here, because Andy explicitly says this is NOT the place for this sort of thing. The diaspora was supposed to result in many such small communities, but instead we get blogs, which are a "Come to me" thing instead of a "Come together" thing. And not one new design community that I've seen (Wicked Dead is sorta an exception).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it exists somewhere in secret, and we've just not been invited...<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a simple solution for anyone with as much gumption as Ron Edwards.

It's that they've all moved to a supa-seekrit site. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65552/#Comment_65552" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T13:55:22+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  1:55PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me personally, I'd think any such "next generation" design forum would need to have some sort of control on population.

It's good to pick some designs and contribute to them, rather than trying to be involved at everything.<br/><br/>The trouble is, it's hit and miss.

Even now, the good games coming out come from small, focused groups of people who play them and give feedback. Small, focused groups don't put a value on publication over transmission: quite the opposite.<br/><br/>Large groups of individuals make it easy to lose intrinsic human connections, which means something has to substitute for it. In the case of the independent roleplaying community, that's been a status graduation via publishing, which will supposedly take you into a smaller group. That hasn't held true, which has resulted in a massive churn in the waters. People used to small groups (me, Matt Snyder, others) don't know what to do and are reacting differently. I've become a hermit that is afraid of the Internet and his own shadow. Matt has become the mountaintop prophet, yelling into the wind. Ron's writing something that he swears isn't a roleplaying game, even though it would have been called one if there was an audience worth talking to. People who aren't used to small groups are talking quickly and frantically, asking each other questions like "What should I name my game company?" The process ate itself.<br/><br/>Small groups work. If anything does, small groups do. I've gotten more out of playing games with a group of three-four people in the last year than I got from the Forge or any other online forum. I don't agree with a lot of what's being said these days, especially when people try to tell other people what they *should* do. But I agree with Ben.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

There may be tons of new people in first thoughts and that's to be expected, and it seems natural that many would burn off. Designing is fucking hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever there are a few folks struggling from first thoughts to playtesting in the playtesting forum, like myself, and there really is no good model to see in that forum as many of the folks who learned at the Forge, no longer openly design there. What I'm suggesting is if you want a culture of openly honest criticism that might be a place to work. The Forge seems to already be a place of openly honest criticism, and to my oh too inexperienced eyes it seems many designers have fled from that same critical community. That's why I have doubts that another web forum will be the answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65691/#Comment_65691" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T07:54:06+00:00" title="April 27, 2007  7:54AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think limiting membership numbers is the right thing to do.

The problem is that they're all screaming their designs and not listening to each other. I would think some custom software or social procedures could help. What if you had to contribute to X number of design threads about other people's games before soliciting feedback for your game? Of course, that doesn't guarantee any kind of <i>quality</i> of feedback, but it does get people to listen.

Last night we playtested Serial. Alexander's brilliant idea is to create a private google community where we will work with the designer in small groups exchanging feedback. Then after the process is over, and with the designers permission, we will make the process public.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I am going to create a private forum on nerdnyc for my Wrestling game. I'm going to give access to 20-50 nerdnyc regulars so they can ask questions, make suggestions, and help with alpha playtesting. After the game is released (probably 1-3 years from now), I am going to make the forum public.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also helps to rotate people in and out of the small groups. That way people can go out and create their own groups and new people can experience the process first hand.

I'm blessed to live in an area with thousands of gamers, hundreds of gamers that you can find on the net (in various local mailing lists), a couple dozen who are actively into the kinds of games that I like for the purposes of the games that I want to design, and over 20, perhaps 30, people who I can turn to any given time and say, "Hey, you: I want to playtest this game face to face, want to join?" There's about 7 people who are actively working on designing indie style games right now, and who will also be willing to throw down at just about any time with an "I'll playtest a session of yours if you playtest in a session of mine".  It's great.  <br><br>One dude has been running private playtests of a game he's working on, where he invites people to his house and makes them lunch, then throws down a session and spends a few hours getting honest, CRITICAL feedback afterwards.<br><br>Another two dudes are actively working on games for publishing in the next year or so, and do much the same thing with whomever is available.<br><br>Another three dudes are at the "writing out ideas, approaching the first playtest" stage, and are forming a small community kinda like a 3-5 person "book club", where they go to Barnes and Noble or some coffee house, drink caffinated beverages, read each others' work, and critique it critically.<br><br>So, to add to Clinton's comment, probably the best thing that you can possibly do to engage in a game development community, is to organize one locally.

Then after the process is over, and with the designers permission, we will make the process public.<br/></span><br>This is what I did to develop My Life with Master. The development forum, sans the rules text itself, was made publicly available at The Forge once the game was complete. And it is the same process I've been using for Acts of Evil. The population of that forum has grown over the months I've been working on the game, and now supports probably somewhere near thirty members.<br><br>But the game isn't done, there are still some thorny design problems, and my local posse and the population of the Acts of Evil forum are pretty much tapped out for insights.<br><br>I don't think the commonly cited half-baked games of Gen Con 2006 are the product of designers having struggled to create small communities. I think they're the result of designers struggling over what to do when their small community is tapped out for insights before the game's design issues are solved. Do they publish it anyway? Or do they put it on the shelf, and accept that their future designs will benefit from what they learned working on it? I never hit this point with My Life with Master. And I'd hazard that most of the stand-out indie games never hit this point. But I hit it with Soul of Man, after much playtesting, and I put the game on the shelf. And now I'm at that point with Acts of Evil.<br><br>I could just make the playtest forum public. But then I lose the "small community" benefit we're talking about.<br/><br/>Yes, some designers are struggling to create small communities. And forced to work among the creative entropy of a large community, mostly what those designers produce are incomplete games. But I can't see any evidence that the half-baked games we're discussing are the output of designers struggling to create small communities. They're the product of a designer who's tapped out his small community choosing not to confront the threat of creative entropy from taking the design to larger community. What this designer wants is a way to import just enough insight to get over the hump without losing the heat of the small community.<br/><br/>I think doing an ashcan is one solution. When I ran an Acts of Evil playtest at Forge Midwest last year I realized that I'd inadvertently identified two members of the game's eventual population of adherents, and that exactly what I needed was adherents from the future to tell me how to solve my design problems. I think doing an ashcan is an endeavor of identifying a small community of your future adherents. Trading playtests and trading feedback are often a grind of mutualism. Your future adherents are a true heat proposition. They want you to realize your game as much as you do.<br/><br/>And if anyone has achieved design success using a different solution for your tapped out small community, I'd love to hear how you did it.<br/><br/>Paul                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65858/#Comment_65858" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T00:30:13+00:00" title="April 28, 2007 12:30AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2007 4:11PM by Anemone.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been following the ashcan and QC threads from a distance, both here and at The Forge.  I'm not a designer and I have no intention to be, so I usually stay out of the discussion when it feels like a club discussion.  But I feel I ought to chime in a few points to give perspective.<br/><br/>First of all, let me give my background: I have been an avid gamer for nearly 25 years, and I am married to another avid gamer.  I like both playing and GMing, I have played about 100 systems (not counting separate editions of the same game), and probably read three times as many.  I am very involved in the local gamer community, including helping organize clubs, weekly games, special game day events, and annual conventions.  I love tinkering with systems and adapting them to various settings.  In the last few years I've been buying small press games like candy.  I'm an active member on many online fora.  I think I can say that "I'm a player, not a hater!"  :-)  So now I'm going to yell at "you designers" a bit but I want you to remember that <i>I am your most devoted fan</i>.<br/><br/><b>Quality.</b>  Yes, it's true: the quality of small press and indie games is very variable, in terms of both content and presentation.  Overall I would say that to my eye, it appears to be improving.  However, there are more games being written each year so more of the half-finished games are bound to make it to publication.  I support and applaud everyone's efforts to improve their own products, and I promise that in the future I will try to give truthful feedback instead of staying silent on flaws.  However... <br/><br/><b>Critique.</b>  I can tell you that whether here, on The Forge, or on other boards, it's really hard to give that kind of feedback in light of the "convert" mentality of some fans.  The attitude that makes it really hard is the well-wishers shouting down criticism with claims of "You just don't understand how it's supposed to be played," or drowning it out in a chorus of "Awesome!"  Very often also, it feels as if critiquing is an activity in which only game designers are allowed to engage.  Here's my thing, though: while another designer may be able to give you pointers, overall \u2014 who the fuck cares about what other designers think?  What matters is what people who might buy and play your game \u2014 GMs, players \u2014 think.<br/><br/><b>Playtesting.</b> How can it possibly be that hard to find playtesters?  There are thousands of gamers out there that would be delighted to playtest games for the simple pleasure of having their names in the cover of the final version, getting bragging rights and insider info, and getting a free PDF.  I love to run playtests, and we frequently run playtests at our local club's weekly drop-in games.  But if you're looking for playtesters by checking The Forge, Story Games, and other designers' blogs... Buddy, you're at the <i>demand</i> side of the chain.  Go check the supply end!  Advertise!  Participate in your local gaming lists!  And I approve of the idea of having a feedback form for your playtesters if there are specific questions you want answered.  I always pay close attention to the playtest instructions so I know what the author is looking for.<br/><br/>I see a big discussion of what technology to use.  That reminds me of myself, running my first campaign lo these decades ago \u2014 lovingly handcrafting maps that people would probably never glance at, detailing scenes and NPCs that would be bypassed by the players' quirky strategies.  If you spend your effort in playing with technologies, you're probably drawing away from the effort of actually trying to recruit playtesters.  A colleague of mine calls it "Procrastination through interest": fiddling with a task you find more interesting in order to put off a chore.<br/><br/><b>The Forge label.</b>  I'm here to tell you that the "Forge label" is not a big selling point except for other people on the same thread at The Forge.  The rest of gamers either have never heard of it or have a neutral to unfavourable impression.  In case you're wondering, I'm personally neutral, meaning I have as many bad impressions of The Forge label as I have good ones.  There are some neat games that came from there, but also a terrible lot of insularity.  So don't feel like a majority of the people who might be interested in your game will be attracted by a Forge blessing.<br/> <br/><b>Insularity and inbreeding.</b> Holy crap, but it's an inward-looking community.  Here are some quotes from the current discussion that made me laugh my head off.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>The most important thing I've taken from the Forge is that the people who play games are just as important (if not, moreso) than the people who design them. Or to put it another way, the act of playing a game is as important as the act of designing them.</blockquote>\nWow, thank you.  As a friend said, "next we'll be saying that drivers and passengers are as important as auto engineers."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Do you get the alternate perspective, from which I can say "Releasing the piece-of-crap game that is your best first effort at the honest-to-God, this-is-not-a-drill act of self-publishing is absolutely the best thing that you can do for yourself and for the community, especially if you make lots of mistakes and therefore learn a lot in the process"?</blockquote>\nUm, no.  Frankly, from the minute I pay money for a product, I really don't want to see your first effort.  If it's published as a finished game, I want a reasonably finished game.  Otherwise, yes, ashcans or free downloads or what have you.  When I buy a book, it's not about the game designer's growth process and self-fulfillment.  Even with the authors I really love, if I think this particular product sucks ass, I don't want to buy it.  No matter how fulfilled the author would be.<br/><br/><b>BDFD?</b>  When I read some of the games, and some of the game discussions, I feel like the real label should read "BDFD \u2014 By Designers, For Designers."  Seriously, there is no reason in the world that a well thought-out game should read like the unholy love child of Ayn Rand and L. Ron Hubbard.  Like Jules said, "English, motherfucker, do you speak it?"  Open an indie game at random.  Some are a pleasure to read, yes; but how many are full of jargon or redefined words, sure to confuse or annoy the average gamer?  <br/><br/>I sometimes think a few designers (mostly the very new ones) harbour the secret belief that if they make their game a bit difficult, if they play hard to get, they'll only get the <i>smart</i> gamers.  Well, no.  You'll probably get the dumb ones \u2014 the ones that haven't figured out that there's a shelf full of legible games they can play.  Don't assume that the average gamer can't "get" your game because s/he's not smart enough.  Most games, indie or not, can be understood and played by most players.  Whether the player and the game are a good fit is a different matter, but if your book is written in jargon, even (or especially) Forge jargon, chances are most players won't stay long enough to find out.<br/><br/><i>"Whate'er is well conceived is clearly said, <br/>And the words to say it flow with ease."</i><br/><br/>Now go out there, write games that a regular person can read without pulling out their hair, and post some calls for playtesters on your local mailing list, at the FLGS, on RPGNet, whatever.  I'll try to read, playtest, review, and recommend as many as I can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65859/#Comment_65859" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T00:50:03+00:00" title="April 28, 2007 12:50AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L.

I really, really love their posts.  But I DO seriously wonder if it's not already a step well past any rational "attention threshold" to ever be a real community of design and play.<br/><br/>I have, very seriously, considered that by stepping out on my own from the various existing groups, instead of fighting tooth-and-claw for my ideas to be accepted among those groups, I might be doing more harm than good - because I'm leeching away energy and attention.<br/><br/>So, no.  I would say that yet another board is not the answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65860/#Comment_65860" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-28T00:53:33+00:00" title="April 28, 2007 12:53AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anemone, thanks for all that.

When I design, it's all about me.  You folks...you can join in too.<br/><br/>If you must.  ;-)<br/><br/>Seriously, my game design motto something like this.  "I design games for people who are about my age and who are me."  (This quote, or something very similar, is attributed to John Tynes.)  I'm working on <i>Dirty Secrets</i> right now, and I'm excited, because it's the kind of game that I'd like to play.  It works the way that I like a game to work, it lets me do that whole "shared character" thing while still leaving room for my wife to do her "immerse in my character" thing, plus I get to play Liars' Dice in the middle of it.  It's the kind of game that I'd buy if someone else made it.  Yeah, I think that it's that good.  Does that mean that you'll think it's that good.  Dunno.  But I know that there are other people out there who would murder for a noir detective game (heh), and I'm guessing that they might be interested.  <br/><br/>I have a couple of other ideas in the pipeline, and they excite me, because they are games that I'd like to play.  I'm looking forward to discovering these games that are in my head, to get them out, onto the table, and be able to share them with the people around me.  And, honestly, even if it turns out that my game group is the only people in the world that are excited about these games, then I still win.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf<br/><br/>(P.S.

Because frankly I think it's true. We've got threads and threads full of people talking about how many indie games they're just dying to get a chance to play. Brand, who appears to actually roleplay about twenty times more often than mere mortals, still talks about all these games on his shelf he hasn't gotten to yet.<br/><br/>So yeah, we have this culture of design. We have endless discussions about its health, about where it should go next. But I see no corresponding culture of play.<br/><br/>And then, people wonder why it's hard to find playtesters, why getting feedback on new games is harder, whatever. Maybe it's because we have too many goddamn games, already, and maybe it's time to start encouraging each other to play them.<br/><br/>We have a 'designer challenge' thread 100 posts long. There is no corresponding 'play challenge', even though, in theory, every game produced should lead to hundreds if not thousands of play experiences. I mean, games are supposed to be reusable tools -- you shouldn't need to design a game for every new campaign you want to play. That just seems screwy, to me. <br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I'm not saying people should stop designing games, or stop talking about game design, or that the designer challenge thread isn't awesome. I just wonder what happened to the other side of the coin.<br/><br/>So much of the insight and the focus of the whole 'indie' scene is the understanding that good design encourages fun play. But sometimes it looks like that's <i>the only thing that anyone thinks encourages good play</i> anymore, and that's so obviously wrong. Yes, we all want awesome game designs, but there's a lot of other things that encourage fun play. I think the current indie community is having a lot of trouble providing that other stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65961/#Comment_65961" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T01:09:51+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  1:09AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel,<br/><br/>Agreed.

I think it's perfectly fine for a game designer to write a game for other game designers, a game for people who will have the additional context to understand them, as Shreyas put it earlier.  But that kind of game is not the one discussed in the O.P.: it does not need to get published on the mass-market.  It can be distributed to fellow designers as, yes, ashcans and PDFs, traded or sold for printing cost.  You write <i>Mutant Mitonchondriae</i>, you send me a copy and in exchange I send you a copy of my game, <i>My Dinner with Entree</i>.<br/><br/>But if the authour goes to mass-market publications \u2014 yes, that includes Lulu, IPR, Your Games Now, RPG Now, Drivethru RPG, etc. \u2014 then the implication is that unless clearly marked otherwise, this is a finished product for general use.  A majority of gamers should be be able to open it, read it, understand it and play it without having to e-mail the designer, scan the forum threads, or otherwise do extensive research on "How does this play."<br/><br/>Therefore, for any game that is mass-marketed, people who play games are <b>not</b> just as important as the people who design them \u2014 they are <i>more</i> important.  They're the ones shelling the money and buying something that should work (note I'm not saying "something they should like.")  <br/><br/>Say for example than the bit I am proudest of in <i>My Dinner with Entree</i> is Mechanic X; I think it's great and my designer friends like it too. Before going to production I do blind playtest, where the playtesters have to play the game as provided without getting additional information from me, and a majority of them then say they hated Mechanic X or couldn't figure out how to use it.  I got my work cut out for me, don't I?  <br/><br/>If I want to publish this game for general use, then I have to go back to the drawing board and figure out how to make it work and explain it better, then playtest again.  If I can't get a majority of playtesters to use Mechanic X, then I can get rid of it, I can market the game to fellow designers and clearly describe it as such, I can continue playtest with revised versions, I can abandon the project for a while, I can seek help from other designers, but I sure as Hell shouldn't just slap a nice cover on it, insert a note that it has been playtested by 354 people, and publish it on Lulu.  It would be unethical because it would mean I am willing to sell an unfinished product as if it was ready.  <br/><br/>Note that there is nothing particularly indie about this.  Note also that for the first 20 years of the hobby, it was almost a tradition for publishers (FASA, Chaosium, White Wolf, GURPS, etc.) to do just that \u2014 <i>say</i> they playtested but not address any of the feedback received, or rush to publish without playtesting, especially for supplements.  The differences are (A) that as creators-owners, you guys can decide when you are ready to publish without being rushed by the company; and (B) that instead of one bad supplement reflecting on the company, one bad indie game can reflect on the entire industry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65995/#Comment_65995" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T10:37:51+00:00" title="April 29, 2007 10:37AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>But I see no corresponding culture of play.</blockquote><p>What?

What's RPGnet about, then, or any of the many other rpg communities that are not about design? </p>\nI'm willing to believe that rpg.net is about play. But it's not part of the indie gaming community. It doesn't focus on playing indie games, it doesn't focus on applying the same community attitude towards play and its discussion &amp; improvement. It can't be the other half of the indie design community because it doesn't share any of the indie design community's priorities or perspectives about play.<br/><br/>And that doesn't mean nobody on rpg.net does any of those things, or there's never discussions of value there about play. But rpg.net is a totally separate community, as far as I can tell, with almost no continuity to Story-Games or The Forge, in terms of membership or general perspective on gaming.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/><br/>And it's not like there isn't any of this discussion here -- there's quite a bit of it, and it's great -- but I do get the feeling that play is not as <i>exalted</i> here and in other indie communities as design is. Design seems to have a special status and a special enthusiasm attached to it, which is both understandable but also kind of weird. It would be cool if some of that same enthusiasm could be channeled towards creative innovation in <i>play</i>, as well as in design. We have a lot of design competitions, for example, but I've never seen a play competition. (I'm not saying there aren't any, I'm not that well-informed.) We have design challenges, but no corresponding play challenges, even though both seem like cool ways to challenge people and expand our horizons as gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66037/#Comment_66037" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-29T20:34:16+00:00" title="April 29, 2007  8:34PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, <br/><br/>I think part of the problem is that you can see what I design, especially if I have a book to sell you. Its much harder to see what I play, especially when you live 3000 miles away. <br/><br/>Now some folks (Judd, say) have gotten a lot of status (and rightly so) for their wonderful AP posts. I've often said that many of the designers in the community should have a shrine to Judd, because his posts have probably gotten more people playing Indie games than any other single person other than like Ron. But that's status due to AP posts and their value in moving games -- not necessarily status for the play itself.<br/><br/>AP posts, like books, you can see and read and comment upon. AP posts are a shared thing among the folks on the net. Play is a shared thing among people at the table.

Excellent.<br/><br/>The real magic that happened (IS happening) from there is that people then used the internet to enhance their life instead of replacing it: That is, they used the internet to find other like-minded gamers... then the same like-minded gamers in their physical vicinity, whom they could then go meet and play with. <br/><br/>Folks who found each other on the Forge, and said "Hey, I live near you! Let's game sometime!"<br/>RPGNetters who went to local RPGNet meetups.<br/>Story Game INSERT CITY/AREA HERE meetups.<br/>Stuff like NerdNYC.<br/><br/>Screw the internet communities (ok, I do love y'all, and this little community we have here, but I'm in the middle of a point here), use them to find focused local gaming groups.<br/><br/>Shit, not sure where I was going with this (too late, gotta go to bed).

Fact is that I talk more about playing indie games there than here and with people that also do post here, at times. Imaginably you are observing that there are not as many posters interested in indie games, proportionally, as there are here, so they seem lost in the shuffle, but I assure you they are there. Saying there's almost no continuity seems analogous to saying that Florida has almost no continuity with the rest of the North American continent. Florida is <em>just not that wide.</em></p>\n<p>I mean, you're asking, "where is the play community?" and I have told you, and then you say to me, "But that one's not good enough because I don't post there, and there are tonloads of people there who are going on about all this other stuff too." You know what? There is not only <em>room for</em> an indie play community out there, there is such a community already in evidence.</p>\n<p>Before I like had my coffee and read what Brand was actually on about, I was about to say this to him:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Brand, what's with the fetishization of AP posts?</p>\n<p>I play Exalted like twice a week. I do not post AP about it now or ever. There is exactly no reason I would want to. But it <em>definitely</em> colours my posting about Exalted on rpgnet and I say so when it does. I don't think it's less of a play community because I don't regale an audience that can't even be bothered to feign interest with tales of the increasingly arcane events and insular drama of my game.</p>\n<p>The AP post is exactly what 'talking about play' looks like when it <em>happens in a particular design community</em> and <em>is intentionally designed to support discussion of game desigg</em> and I don't think it's reasonable to really care about it outside there. Looking in the rpgnet Actual Play forum, checking some random threads, it seems like the vast majority of threads have no posts by other than the author, and those that run into discussion end up being about the source material or interpretation of the text. And <em>so what.</em> That's just not how a community that's focused on play organically works, apparently.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>And um I think the questions of "where are the play contests" and like "where is the exaltation of creative innovation in play" are exactly questions that one would ask if one expected exactly analogous interactions in the design and play communities, and that is <em>extra dinosaur silly.</em> I'm constantly talking about how to play good and have extra bonus fun, and maybe you're just not seeing it because you're reading with design-community eyes. That's not the language being spoken out there.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66053/#Comment_66053" name="Item_166" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T01:14:58+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  1:14AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2007 1:16AM by Mcdaldno.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas, well put. All around.<br/><br/>I have trouble getting much out of extensive, background-heavy AP reports on The Forge and it seems like you do too.<br/><br/>I also, however, have difficulty pulling any play-focused "stuff" out of most RPG.net threads. I find that RPG.net reads like prep rather than like play. I see a lot of "How can I make this system work with this genre". Most of the play focused stuff seems to be "stupidest thing a GM ever said" or "how many TPKs have you had?" Polls.<br/><br/>I totally believe you that there is a wicked community of play discussion at RPG.net, and specifically one focused on indie games. But I have trouble finding it. Not in a stiff, Forge-AP form... but, in any form. I'm wondering if you could help point this out to me a bit.<br/><br/>Like, link me to it happening. a link or two or three.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And now, to seem super hypocritical... Shreyas and Daniel, remember that the topic at hand is about quality control, not communities for discussing actual play. I realize the two are connected, but let's make sure to stay focused on the topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66151/#Comment_66151" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T09:41:14+00:00" title="April 30, 2007  9:41AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm glad Shreyas came out against detailed Actual Play posts. I agree with him completely. I almost said something myself, but I thought that might be too controversial, even for a list of controversial ideas.</p>\n<p>But now that he's opened that bag, I want to say why I think Actual Play posts, as we have come to think of them, are not helpful for quality control. They're trying to do too many things at once. For example, there are instructions on the Forge about how to include the names of all the people involved, which characters they chose to play, how they interacted with each other, moments when they seemed to turtle or to struggle for control with the GM, and so on. These instructions are really intended for GNS analysis, back when people were trying to investigate GNS more and analyze where their play group was having problems. Most of it is useless for quality control, unless someone is reporting that their group, which normally has no problems, had problems when playing your game. Even then, it's only useful if you can eliminate non-game reasons for the sudden problems.</p>\n<p>Another problem is the focus of most AP reports on the story that play session produced, or the "insular drama" and "arcane events" that Shreyas mentions. I believe the focus on that comes from the idea of AP as a selling point for a game. Maybe that's useful after a game has reached the post-ashcan phase, but when the game is still being developed, all the designer wants to know are moments that stood out during play: high points and low points. "We spent 45 minutes following the prep instructions and got so bored, we almost gave up." "We totally weren't expecting the lightning-fast exchanges and general excitement of the repartee phase!"</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66177/#Comment_66177" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-30T11:01:49+00:00" title="April 30, 2007 11:01AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas, right on about the RPGnet indie community.
