Essentially, it's sort of Zombie Apocalypse: the Movie: the RPG.  I have this idea I want to use.... I know, bad idea, but the idea is just too cool, and I'm trying to get past the detail of implementation.  <br/><br/>So in each Act (the game is divided into three Acts, either one per session for three sessions or one per one-third of one session), each player gets to make one Exposition about something.  It's a thing the player is declaring to be true, about their own character, their relationship to another character, to the rationale for zombies in the setting, whatever.  It's very much related to the dictum that "If the audience sees a gun in Act I, it needs to be fired in Act III."  <br/><br/>So, anyway: all the time in movies you hear characters... expositing.  Bits of info dumping.  For instance, one character says, rather clumsily, "As you know, Bob, zombies are vulnerable to &lt;insert technobabble here&gt;."  The player who has dropped that bit of exposition has for this game defined that as the zombie vulnerability, with the added implication that &lt;insert technobabble here&gt; will be found somewhere by some character between now and act III and used to end the zombie menace. <br/><br/>I want these Expositions to have some degree of... <i>reality</i> is the only way I can describe it.  Like, say, if a player describes his character's family as being important to him, without using that bit of Exposition, it's just a bit of background noise.... but if that Exposition (token or whatever) is used, then the family is flagged as being important to the plot in some way.  Like, without using the token or whatever, the zombies can eat the family out of hand, but if they are explicitly Exposited, it takes a fight to take them out.  (Gawd, describing it like that sounds like I'm reinventing <i>Capes</i>, not that that's such a bad thing.)<br/><br/>Am I overthinking this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151280/#Comment_151280" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T23:16:25+00:00" title="June 17, 2008 11:16PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmm...I like the idea...<br/><br/>In television, there is a similar technique called "laying pipe".

For instance, one player drops an Exposition that in the mountains there's a secret military facility where they're working on a secret weapon against the zombies.  If he spends his token on it or whatever, it's now a true statement.  If (and here's where I'm not sure) he doesn't spend the token, either he doesn't make the statement, or it's not really true, or by the time they find the secret military facility in the mountains it's too late and everyone's already dead or zombies. <br/><br/>What I don't want is that when the guy spends his token to say "I need to get to my family," that that sets up a contest where he either wins or the family dies.  But yeah, it is a way for that player to say "Yes, my family is out there, and there's something important to me about them being there, so I want them to be a part of the game."  Whereas, if he doesn't spend the token, and says "I need to get to my family," then I guess we eventually get a heartbreaking scene where he has to blow away his zombified wife and kids.  <br/><br/>Does this make sense or am I approaching it backwards?  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SweeneyTodd</cite>Well, mechanizing a particular piece of input can be a way to say "I want this to be explored in a particular way".

And my comments illustrate just one approach, sorry guys.  I think what you are saying makes sense, Chris, and the really important piece will be how the economy functions.  Those statements are going to be epochal, because the introduction of the secret base creates a framework for substantial in-game activity.  They need to be issued at a rate that matches the sort of game you want to run (which is a nice group-set dial I think), and there needs to be some understanding about what the parameters are.  Maybe only a practical upper bound, because players will latch onto smaller stuff (we're playing TSoY zombie holocaust, and my guy is obsessed with his family bible.  Obsessed!)<br/><br/>The "zombie swarm between things" principle is rock solid!  You could even quantify that - "You want to rekindle your love for Sally?

Off the top of my head, magic in Mortal Coil is defined in this fashion, virtually everything in Universalis is built this way, the GM's budget in PTA and Agon is spent to establish the mechanical strength of things, and Spirit of the Century (along with some other games) allows you to establish information through skill rolls.  In the latter case, if you make your History roll, for example, you can declare stuff like, "Wow, these ruins are millions of years old, way older than human settlements in this area."

It would be nice to have a way to nicely quantify this bonus. <br/><br/>Jason, I hadn't thought much about an Exposition economy, beyond the statement "In each Act, each character gets one Exposition."  It seems, though, that this makes a nice reward mechanism.  It also means more complexity in the design, but not insurmountably so.  <br/><br/>Thanks for your comments, guys!
