                    So, the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2410" rel="nofollow">thread about Torg, which ended up being a thread about Shadowrun</a> reminded me of something that happened recently:<br/><br/>I played Shadowrun at a con a couple of weeks ago.  It was the first time I'd played in about a gazillion* years.  It was the new funky 4th edition, which I've looked over and thought was an interesting change, somewhat less fiddly than earlier editions.  Unlike a lot of people I actually really rather liked Shadowrun's system.  I guess there's something to do with the fact that when it came out in 1989 I was 14 and when you're that age learning the rules to games like that it pretty easy because you have plenty of time.<br/><br/>The game I played in was part of a thing called Shadowrun: Missions.  It's kinda like the "Living" games, except advancement is much less of an issue in Shadowrun than it is in D&amp;D, so people appear to be far less bothered about tracking characters XP and stuff.<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun, and I realised something pretty interesting after the game was over:  I was, without thinking about it, stating my desired outcome for every action I was taking.  So, while the session started off with people saying stuff like<br/><br/>Player 1: "I shoot him"<br/>*Rolls dice*<br/>Player 1: "7 hits!"<br/>*GM rolls defence*<br/>GM: "He goes down in a hail of bullets, but the other 4 Yakuza start to return fire."<br/>Player 1: "Damn, what the hell does it take to scare these guys?"<br/><br/>I started saying stuff like:<br/><br/>Rich: "I shoot Johnny Ono in the face.  He's in charge of this Yakuza posse, if I just blow him away coldly that'll hopefully rattle the others.  If we can show them we're good, they might just back down rather than risk getting into a fight they can't handle"<br/>*Rolls Dice*<br/>Rich: "7 hits!"<br/>*GM rolls defence*<br/>GM: "Johnny goes down, your two shots hitting him in the chin and forehead.  The other Yakuza guys show a look of shock and surprise as the body of their leader slumps to the ground and they begin getting pretty nervous.  Rich, gimmie an intimidate roll."<br/><br/>After a while I realised that the other players started doing it as well.  I think it lead to some more interesting scenes and things probably played out with lots more colour than they might have because people were really starting give the GM some decent idea of what we actually wanted out of the game.  He seemed to really pick up on that stuff.<br/><br/>The game was fun, I think I might have managed to subconsciously make it a bit more fun by drifting some hippy ideals into a very traditional game.<br/><br/>Plus, y'know, they gave me a character who was a hot elf chick with an armoured trenchcoat and two katanas and I got to decapitate some ghouls with them.  Which was totally awesome.<br/><br/>* Checking my notes, it seems a gazillion in this context is a number equal to 5.                </div>

I haven't read that whole link yet. But for me, it seems that Rich was doing the Player equivalent of a Funky GM Trick. <br/><br/>Like, a Funky GM Trick might be to have all the players start in media res (I think Jeff Rients said something like, "At the beginning of my sessions the players find themselves in the middle of a combat, and it's only later that we find out how we got there and why"). Or use name-cards with the character names on them. Or grab a player and say, "I need you to pretend to be the shopkeeper for this scene, can you do that? Good, Go!" Y'know, little tricks that make the game more interesting to some.<br/><br/>Rich just did the same, but as a player. Not really being sneaky about it, just throwing it out there. People took to it, and it sounds like it worked. Rock on.<br/><br/>Something I do at games when I'm a player is that I'll state my emotions as if the other players were reading them in a book.<br/><br/><b><i>ANDY:</i></b> " "What?"...I say that as a put on this incredulous face, while thinking of the implications of what Fragdor the Orc said to me earlier."<br/><br/>Like, I say that entire thing. If I can't express the nuances like an actor supremo (and I can't), I just show AND tell. At my last Con game I noticed one of the other players started picking up on it.  It didn't do anything huge to the direction or control of the game, but it at least gave a little more depth to the social action, and showed another tool for folks to use.<br/><br/>Agenda-free Player (or GM) Tricks.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I don't think this is sneaking up conflict resolution, but something else: no explicit stakes, neh? GM retains full interpretative power.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that the reason I've never missed conflict resolution is because when having my characters do things for non-obvious reasons I've always tried to make sure the GM knows the character's reasoning beforehand -- which is what you did. GM could still have decided that you're just being silly or introduced a complication.<br/><br/>"Johnny goes down with his brains plastered across the ceiling. Everyone looks surprised for a second before diving for cover. One of the yakuza yells from behind the sofa: ``Fuck, why did you have to do that? Have you no idea of the tips we have to pay the maids to clean up a mess like that!?``, and pops a cap in your direction. Another says: ``Chill, maids are nothing. He was always an asshole, and this is our ticket up the ladder.``"                        </div>

                            The thing that's really interesting to me is that this wasn't some kind of clever trick or something I was playing to encourage anything.  It was the third game I played in the con, and the first two were Scott Dorwood's DitV game and a massive, 8 player UmlÃ¤ut game.  So I was really in a hippy gaming frame of mind and just started playing Shadowrun that way without thinking.<br/><br/>I think the point is that, yeah, with games like that where the GM has complete authority (sorta-kinda) he often has to second guess what the players are up to.  The GM in this situation is kinda operating in the dark as to the player's intentions.  Letting him know what your intentions are for an action is tantamount to saying "wouldn't it be totally cool if this happened?"  If players do that, it takes some of the load off the GM if he's up for that.  Also, if suggests things the GM probably hasn't thought of.  More ideas in the GMs head = more likelihood of an awesome idea.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really didn't do this with any kind of agenda, it was pretty organic to see the GM and other players pick up on it.                        </div>

                            Cool stuff, no question about it.<br/><br/>The only thing I would add is that knowing the scheme the character has in mind allows not just cool successes, but also allows the GM to create interesting complications, and to lay down an awesome garden path of misconceptions -- something which is otherwise pretty much impossible unless the scheme is really obvious. <br/><br/>I justed wanted to underline that (1) this was not conflict resolution (2) there is plenty of life in task resolution yet.                        </div>

                            I phrased that badly, but I labour indeed under the impression that without stakes you don't have conflict resolution. Given that the default system that was being used doesn't involve stakes I don't think you can assume implicit stakes just because the character's reason for doing something has been explained.<br/><br/>I'll try again: does letting others in on the reasoning of a character turn task resolution into conflict resolution? If this is not a sufficient condition then what makes this a case conflict resolution?<br/><br/>Maybe I'll just go and add myself to the list of people who don't understand what conflict resolution means. ;-)                        </div>

                            Well, it's not <em>necessarily</em> conflict resolution just because you have stakes (and, like Brand pointed out, stakes are not a requirement for resolution to be on the conflict level).<br/><br/>The short version is that conflict resolution puts the objectives that are the cause for a character's actions on the line, whereas task resolution puts the success or failure of a particular task (ahem) up for grabs.<br/><br/>Fred Hicks wrote a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1728&amp;page=1#Item_44" rel="nofollow"><em>great</em> article</a> about resolution a few months back.

                            I believe the defining factors are that the method of resolution has to resolve (gain, loose, transform, or escalate) the intent (implicit or explicit) of the player (not the character).<br/><br/>But I'm not sure :-(                        </div>
