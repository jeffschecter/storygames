I'd particularly love to join in on a session or two of story gaming, but I'm certainly up for some 4th Ed. or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm close to useless in languages other than English, so no German-speaking groups, please.  =)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny takers or pointers?  Any great game stores for SG stuff in ZRH?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n-John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293274/#Comment_293274" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T19:02:44+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  7:02PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I went, J\xf6rg Bours and his buddy took me out to eat, to a comic and then a game store. No real stores focusing on 'story games', but really nice people and interesting food. Eat the Parisian Macaroons or you will regret it. I met up with him from RPGNet. Will give you his contact info privately, but a "Hey, anyone up for meeting in Zurich" post over at RPGnet went a long way.<br/><br/>While the university-going crowd like Joerg and his buddies love any kind of RPG, they're really into it for the long run: They love long campaigns. But if you bring a one-shot, I'm sure they'll like it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
