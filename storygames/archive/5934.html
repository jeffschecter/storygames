Lordy, I didn't realize how much I missed that game!<br/><br/>We had Mike, who'd read Capes long ago but never played, and David and Nathan, who were new to the game. David I've played Shock: with before, Nathan I'd never met.<br/><br/>I spread out a potpourri of old-skool comics (Spider-man ranging from Lee-Ditko to the deaths of Captain Stacy and daughter, X-men including the Dark Phoenix saga, and a couple of Byrne Fantastic Fours with choice Doom appearances) for inspiration, and with 12-inch Doctor Doom presiding, I explained the whole Capes premise ("Power is fun. . .but do you deserve it?"). I talked about the kinds of conflicts inherent in a classic superhero story, referencing the comics for examples. Then I passed out the Click 'n Locks, and we hit the ground running!<br/><br/>Here's what we made:<br/><br/><b>David</b> made <b>Behemoth</b>, an ancient Celtic Earth spirit, 12 feet tall and ponderous, who has awakened and crossed the Atlantic ocean, confused and angered by the march of technology and driven to its largest concentration, NYC.<br/><b>Brick + Inhuman</b><br/>Justice 3, Truth 1, Love 1, Hope 1, Despair 3<br/>Justice Exemplar: Osprey, an ecoterrorist using the Behemoth for his dirty work. Petty Crook + Crusader, I forget the Exemplar conflict. Perhaps we never made one.<br/><br/><b>Mike</b> made <b>SPOT-9</b>, a giant humanoid robot with the intelligence-enhanced brain of a dog. He was only supposed to be a temporary guinea pig, his master intending to transfer his own brain, but there was a terrible lab accident and. . .well, there's no master anymore, and SPOT-9 is loose and confused.<br/><b>Robot + Guilt-ridden</b><br/>Justice 1, Pride 1 Love 3, Fear 2, Duty 2<br/>Love Exemplar: Johhny Solder, a tech from the lab with a fondness for SPOT. Conflict: "Johhny's trapped in a. . .!"<br/><br/><b>I</b> made the <b>Harbinger</b>, mysterious manipulative herald of the downfall of Civilization, at least if he has anything to say about it.<br/><b>Teleporter + Seducer</b><br/>Obsession 3 Pride 1 Truth 2 Despair 1 Fear 2<br/>Truth exemplar: Senator Harrison, corrupt politician backed by industrialists. I forgot to give him a conflict, but it would have to be about duping the public, of course.<br/><br/><b>Nathan</b> made <b>Joe Smiles</b>, AKA <b>Super Smiley</b>, eager young community booster and all around nice guy, who uses his fighting skills to protect the neighborhood.<br/><b>Martial Artist + Angsty Nice Guy</b><br/>Justice 1, Truth 2, Love 3, Hope 2 Duty 1<br/>Hope Exemplar: notorious mobster William "Bill Blaster" Blastione, who's putting the squeeze on the 'hood with his high-tech thugs. High Tech Mooks + Ex-Victim, conflict: Bill's about to hurt someone.<br/>(by the way, if anyone's curious about the above templates, you can find 'em all and more on <a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/" rel="nofollow">the website</a>.)<br/><br/>I picked Bill Blaster to play and set the <b><i>first scene</i></b>, in which Bill's thugs are leaning on the proprietor of a family restaurant in Joe Smiles' neighborhood. Everyone placed themselves there--Joe's busing tables, just, y'know, to help out, David played the corrupt Senator, there for a business lunch with Blastione, and Mike whipped up Mr. Vincienzo, the owner.<br/><br/>I played out the free conflict "Bill's about to hurt someone," and layed it on thick--Bill's doing the whole threatening talk about "protection," his goons all have conspicuous jacket bulges, and Vincienzo's shaking in his boots. Joe comes in all obesquious to take drink orders, trying to defuse the situation. Then while he's in back, the sitch escalates, about to get ugly. . .and Joe comes hurtling back out front, triple-flipping in the air and landing on the table, serving out the drinks without missing a drop. But then Vincienzo gets brave and starts bragging on Joe and how bill's in big trouble now, this guy's going to clean his clock. Joe busts out some more lightning moves and disarms all the thugs, training their own blasters on them to wait for the police to arrive. Meanwhile the Senator's trying to beat a sly retreat without incurring Bill's wrath, but fails, earning the mobster's emnity.<br/><br/>Scene ends with a new hero born, and the adulation of the masses headed by a grateful Mr. Vincenzo.<br/><br/><b><i>Second scene</i></b> was rather unrelated, as we wanted to bring in all our remaining hero/villain characters. So the Behemoth is attacking a secret lab complex, alarm claxons blazing and paramilitary folks scurrying frantically about. Joe Smiles is leading his By Scout troop in the surrounding woods, and leaves them in the hands of the assistant Scoutmaster to respond to the crisis as Super Smiley! Manwhile, Spot-9 is sniffing around the complex and wants to use this distraction to gain access to is old lab, to figure out what happened to him. And the Harbinger perches, a jet-black haunting figure, atop the complex surveying the chaos below, preparing to intervene in his own time ("Event: the Harbinger offers a terrible choice").<br/>The Harbinger and K-9 fought at the gates to the complex, 2 12-foot titans clashing mightily, and Super Smiley lent a hand. The two heroes alternated between physical force and convincing the Behemoth of the error of his ways. . .which got really fun when the Harbinger appeared and began making a very tempting case for tearing it all down--today the lab, and tomorrow the world! The lab's defenders put up a "protonic momentum inhibitor array" or somesuch around the combatants, though that didn't deter the Harbinger. Spot-'s pal Johnny Solder then rushed up to the guards (Mike paid a Story Token to add a second character) claiming that Spot-9 was property of the lab and shouldn't be damaged. The guards then made plans to capture Spot9, but Spot unleashed a missile barrage that KO'd the field generator. Johnny realized his mistake and distracted the troops, while everyone beat a retreat. Spot fled into the woods and was picked up by Johnny, and the Harbinger, realizing his tool would be greatly damaged if he stayed to fight, convinced the Behemoth to join his cause and teleport away with him. . .leaving behind Super Smiley, once again the brave hero who saved the day!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132631/#Comment_132631" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T09:52:31+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  9:52AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some interesting observations and issues:<br/><br/>1) For some reason, I keep falling into the trap of setting up an opening scene with lots of dialogue and only one Powered (I.E. Dept-producing) character. Once again I just walked blindly into the situation, and only when I started to wonder when anyone was ever going to get a couple of Dept Tokens so I could explain Staking and Splitting, did I realize I had a slow-starter scene on my hands. Still, though, it seemed like the right scene to do, especially as we realized in hindsight that we'd just played Super Smiley's Origin Story. The scene did leave us all craving some straight-up action, but then. . .that's just what we did next. Maybe that's not such a bad warmup after all; it allows some buildup and exposition, as opposed to just plunging in.<br/><br/>2) The one thing that always trips me up when teaching Capes is Inspirations--there doesn't seem to be any elegant way to explain how the dice-matching works, and I always tend to forget about them in the first place and have to backtrack. I think there's something about the finality of "OK, conflict's finished, clear it away" that makes me instinctively, well, clear it away, before I remember that those dice need to stay put with their numbers showing for just a liiitle bit longer.Not sure there's much to be done for this, it's just a thing.<br/><br/>3) I've noticed as my Capes-Fu has matured that it's become easier to marry description/narration to the mechanics. While "take an action, say what your hero's doing, roll the dice" is pretty easy to grasp, narration for stuff like Inspirations and staking debt is easier to let fall by the wayside. I'm starting to see those mechanics move from sorta metagame to an integral part of the narrative (the Flash demo on Tony's website is a big, shall we say, Inspiration), and that's pretty neat.<br/><br/>4) There was a social thing I encountered that was a little stickier. We had one player, Nathan, who seemed a little out of sync with the rest of the group. It's not that his input wasn't creative or fun, but it was sorta. . .produced in isolation, it seemed; while the rest of us were busily building a web of characters and conflicts around Technology vs. Nature, he was in his own corner, so to speak, producing a Martial Artist and a Mobster that had nothing to do with the whole network of Hidden Labs and Celtic Earth Spirits and portents of doom. Now, we all <i>made</i> it work--our little Silver Age universe was resilient enough to hold that disparity and not shatter, and everything was connected (the Harbinger to the Senator to the Mobster to the Martial Artist) despite the disunity, and it was fine. I mean, hey, if Marvel Girl can be Misty Knight's roommate. . . it was like the first scene was some intro story from the back of Journey into Mystery <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23182&amp;Mode=like">#182</a> or something, and the second was Supervillain Team-up #13: The Harbinger and Behemoth. It was cool. But the fact is we had one guy who didn't seem to be on the same wavelength. He tended to have a hard time keeping up with what character is which and what they're doing and what just happened, though he never lacked for cool and entertaining input when his turn came around.<br/><br/>The thing is, I often found myself "suggesting" or "directing" his input a little, just trying to make an action or concept mesh. Either taking an idea that just pushed the silly barrier a bit and going "hmm, how 'bout if it was like this. . .?" or else "now, remember, you've got the Behemoth in a headlock, so if you're going to do a different action you'd have to let go of him. What about using a personality trait and talking to him?" I had only the best motives at heart, of <i>course</i>, and I never vetoed an idea or even toned it, just made the gonzo make sense, made it the "right" kind of gonzo (like adding the "Blastione" to "Bill Blaster). But still, it left a bad taste in my mouth. It felt too "GM-y," too "my game my way," too controlling, too patronizing. I dunno, maybe my fellow players will chime in here on how they felt about it. Nathan's a great guy, and I don't want to patronize him or put him down.<br/><br/>Anyway, the upshot is, even with that bit of friction in my head, the session was rewarding, exciting, hilarious, and left us all wanting more. While I've enjoyed the one-shot at parties thing, which Capes does well, there's really robust potential for ongoing play, even with minimal prep (like 4 Heroes/Villains, with one exemplar each), that I'm dying to explore. I've got at least one player practically <i>begging</i> to continue our sessions, and I'd be delighted to as soon as my current short-run game wraps up.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132696/#Comment_132696" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T12:17:44+00:00" title="March  5, 2008 12:17PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Behemoth here.<br/><br/>This was my first experience with Capes, and compared to the other superhero games I've played (many, going all the way back to Superhero 2044) it's the only one that renders a true comic-book feel.  <br/><br/>Melinglor is being too hard on himself, reading too much "coercion" into the "guidance" he was giving Nathan.  Nathan was playing his first GM-less "indie" game, and it was clear that he was in need of a little nudge.  Melinglor provided a lot of positive as well as constructive feedback.  I think it played out well.<br/><br/>The session also served to highlight my frustration with one-shots.  A single session is sufficient to introduce a character, but not sufficient to develop one...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132698/#Comment_132698" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T12:23:02+00:00" title="March  5, 2008 12:23PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, David!<br/><br/>I'm glad to get that outside perspective; hopefully Nathan felt the same way.
