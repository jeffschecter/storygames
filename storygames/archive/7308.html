She had a lot of fun, but the rules definitely seem designed for a group. The static hung out around 1-5. Without more people rolling there were less failures, and I stuck in an NPC team leader to try to accumulate some of that insubordination Static and while that produced some interesting situations (she was obedient to the point of absurdity - I had make the team leader a bit of a psycho) it was a little limp. We're going to game again tonight and I'm not sure if I should tinker with the rules since she had so much fun the first time, or if I should ditch it in favor of something I know will work with one player (maybe Hero's Banner).<br/><br/>Oh, and so I ran into a problem and maybe I just couldn't find it in the rules but it goes like this. She ended up fighting an HP, losing a crapload of rolls, and reaching a situation where her stats were so reduced that she couldn't possibly win if she rolled, and her heart rate was through the roof. As far as I could tell by the rules, I couldn't just narrate her dying, but she wasn't going to make a roll that she couldn't possibly win that would result in her death. Also, as far as I could tell there's no maximum heart limit that results in your ejection/death like there was in Lacuna's first attempt. Does such a limit exist?<br/><br/>What happened in game is she just laid there in blood and broken glass after she got thrown through a window, with the HP trying to taunt her into doing something. She refused to act, and there was an interesting conversation, and eventually it got bored and left. I did not want to just outright narrate her demise and I'm not even sure if, by the rules, I could. Could I? Or should I even? How does a player die in these circumstances?<br/><br/>Anyways, that's been my experience with Lacuna and a lone player.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162422/#Comment_162422" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-13T08:35:29+00:00" title="August 13, 2008  8:35AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's how Lacuna goes.
