Their English is good enough to play even if we have rough patches where we have to stop and use our dictionaries. I use the roleplay to teach spontaneous, new vocabulary;\xa0the students have to write a simple AP after the session as a homework activity.\xa0 So, it's a comprehensive learning activity: speaking, listening, vocabulary, and writing; the students enjoy it.\xa0<br/>In the past, we've played using <a href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">@John_Harper</a> 's Pocket Danger Patrol playsets: a fairy-tale fantasy playset, an Agents of Shield-esque re-skin, and a Journey to the West one.\xa0 These were playsets I'd brewed up based on the students' interests. Recently we wanted to change rule sets, so we've started to play Kingdoms of Ooo by Mike Wight ( <a href="/forums/profile/Gremlin_Legions">@Gremlin_Legions</a> ) (I hope I got Mike's last name right).<br/>Kingdoms of Ooo is a World of Dungeons (WoDu) hack, set in the world of Adventure Time, a post-acapcalytic world of magic, technology, mutants and fairy-tale creatures.\xa0 But Kingdoms of Ooo isn't a straight up re-skin for Adventure Time.\xa0 It strips out some WoDu rules and adds some interesting innovations of its own.\xa0 It's a play-to-find-out sandbox.\xa0 One thing I've done is transplant our campaign into our own setting (hence the title of this post, "Not-Ooo").\xa0 It's a similar setting, but not Adventure Time.\xa0 I didn't want the students watching the show and thinking of th show as cannon. I wanted them to be free to create their own world.\xa0 Otherwise, we are playing the RAW.<br/>In the older group, the characters are a half-demon prince, a great captain of soldiers, and a healer ready to defend her patients with a sword.\xa0 Why they are together hasn't been established yet. The younger group comprises a young thunder wizard (we're looking for more players for this group, but at the moment, it's a group of one).<br/>For our first session, I brought Dirk Leichty's (<a href="/forums/profile/Dirk%29">@Dirk)</a> Bleakwood House Chronicles dungeon starter. The two groups have approached the module completely differently.\xa0<br/>(to be continued)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
