One of the things suggested was a 10-15 minute scene/teaser for various games. I think they were popular back in 2006 at the Forge and its derived booths, but I haven't heard about them recently.<br/><br/>Is anyone still putting out little one scene teaser scenarios for a taste of their games? Or has the Games On Demand concept swallowed that whole space?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
