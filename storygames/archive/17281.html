They also try to IP violation on the art, despite the fact that the project's artist posted a video of himself (prior to the nonsense) drawing the art in question by hand using a different reference entirely...LAME, Chaosium.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1460165270/cthulhu-playing-cards/posts" rel="nofollow">The project creator ended up caving</a> because Chaosium has more money to spend on lawyers, regardless of the actual legalities. Yay, capitalist legal system... <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/><br/>I will add that he spoke gracefully about the coup, but I doubt I will purchase another Chaosium product after the icky feeling the whole situation gave me. I am still getting a couple decks to support the creators (and for my collection!), but only because the licensing agreement doesn't involve any additional royalties for Chaosium beyond what's already been paid, so withholding my cash at this point doesn't hurt  Chaosium any.<br/><br/>2. <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/674003445/classic-dungeon-adventurers-miniature-set-chibi-an?ref=category" rel="nofollow">A different project rips off the D&amp;D cartoon of my youth</a>, so I contact the project creator to ask whether he had licensed the images after which the minis had been based (which I suspected he hadn't, since the project was careful to avoid mention of Dungeons and Dragons). After no response back, I looked back and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/674003445/classic-dungeon-adventurers-miniature-set-chibi-an/posts" rel="nofollow">he had made an update (which slyly tries to call the project a parody)</a>. Looking back at the project page, the word <b>parody</b> had been carefully inserted (and bolded, even!) in order to afford its magical protective shield...fuck that. I reported him to Wizards, because that is not parody, it's use of IP without permission, and it's dishonest business. <br/><br/>I am actually in the beginning stages of creating an AW hack based off of Fantasy Flight's IP and a friend asked why I didn't just change the names of things to avoid IP issues. I explained that that would be intellectually dishonest and that it was better to license the IP and art assets from FF if I ever intended the project to go to publication. Just the right thing to do, in my mind.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391772/#Comment_391772" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T11:00:16+00:00" title="September 29, 2012 11:00AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aye, I had thrown in for a deck of Cthulhu cards prior and I read that update about the legal trouble and my heart sank a little bit.

They're sold in similar places and for similar purposes. It's not like you could take a say skateboard trademark and use it unlicensed for snowboards without having trouble. The key issue is whether a customer would be likely to get confused by the similarities, and I have to say that at least I would: if I found "Call of Cthulhu" playing cards being sold at a game store (with extremely similar trade dress to boot!), I would assume that it's the Chaosium trademark at work. Ultimately trademark issues are of course somewhat subjective, but if you believe differently, you have the option of seeking legal opinions, both binding and otherwise.<br/><br/>It's notable that the existence of the public domain short story is a red herring here, trademark does not care. "Public domain" is a label for works that are free of copyright. Similar situations abound, and I guess that it's pretty obvious to everybody that the existence of say an old literary author with the surname "McDonald" does not justify starting a literary coffee shop called "McDonald's" in a market where that name is heavily associated with an entirely different product.<br/><br/>Trademarks are important, often much more so than mere copyright (this being said by a copyright-critical individual, you understand). As far as I can see, Chaosium is handling this situation with perfect courtesy and professionalism, and they've apparently offered an acceptable deal to these hopefuls so as to make the project work. In their stead I would probably have reworked my art and presentation (call them "Cthulhu Rises" playing cards and avoid that classic green-tinted Chaosium look, and you're pretty much golden, I'd imagine), but apparently they're so clueless about trademarks that it's probably better to simply let Chaosium's licensing department make sure that they're good to go rather than try to figure it out themselves. Who knows, they might even net some slight improvements to the already slick visuals.<br/><br/>That other case is just sad. "Diminutive Mage" indeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391784/#Comment_391784" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T12:44:17+00:00" title="September 29, 2012 12:44PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking on the back of my most recent pack of my "Call of Cthulhu (R) The Card Game (TM)" Asylum pack, it appears that FFG licenses the Call of Cthulhu trademark from Chaosium.

Anime chibi DnD minis are probubly as niche. but honestly i thought those minis were styled for use in super dungeon explore.<br/><br/>i really really wish this world still had things that entered the public domain. imagine if star wars was public domain, ok imagine if something you still liked from childhood was public domain.<br/><br/>for a ludicrous example, Dorthy is public domain but her shoes are not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/silby" title="silby"><img alt="silby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/silby">silby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391823/#Comment_391823" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-29T19:47:38+00:00" title="September 29, 2012  7:47PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2012 7:47PM by silby.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's not that inexplicable, since the ruby slippers were created for the 1939 film, whereas the original Baum novel featured silver slippers, and Baum died in 1919. /derail                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391837/#Comment_391837" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T00:46:50+00:00" title="September 30, 2012 12:46AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ludicrous things can still be explained.

Two entirely different legal phenomena, so I don't immediately see what Dorothy's shoes have to do with the Call of Cthulhu trademark.<br/><br/>As for ludicrous, that's in the eye of the beholder; the ruby slippers thing doesn't seem ludicrous to me because I understand that copyright is about published works, not about vague thoughts and wishy-washy impressions people have in their heads. Maybe somebody associates ruby slippers with Dorothy (obviously because of this other work they've enjoyed), but that has nothing to do with a specific written work that has lapsed into public domain but does not have that particular element. You can't deduce what is public domain and what isn't by what random cultural associations given people might have in their heads - you have to look at the publishing record to see what things have entered the marketplace and when. The book and the movie are separate things, I don't see anything strange in them having separate and unique legal existence in copyright law. If this wasn't the case then the movie "Tangled" from Disney would be public domain due to having a basis in a classical fairytale. <i>That</i> would be ludicrous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391841/#Comment_391841" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-30T02:09:23+00:00" title="September 30, 2012  2:09AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2012 2:12AM by TylerT.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were to publish a catalog of Dorthy with shoes in all conceivable colors aside from ruby red and copyright it, then how would anyone use Dorthy again? barefoot perhaps? Understand that aside from thinking it's a bit ludicrous I make no real value judgement of the laws or politics. When you tell the average person that Dorthy is public domain but her shoes are not they tend to laugh and ask why. There are reasons for it but on the surface yes, quite ludicrous. especially when you consider that the red shoes will likely be protected for much longer than Dorthy herself was.<br/><br/>And I know the difference between trademark and copyright, in the case of characters they often have both forms protection and for characters trademarks are quite a bit more powerful form of protection. In this case my educated guess would be that copyright defends the movie and imagery with ruby red slippers where the "idea" of Dorthy with red slippers is trademark protection given it's imitating a specific version of Dorthy that people would associate with the producers of the movie in a way that may harm their trade.<br/><br/>but I do not wish to argue politics.

The use of color in that film is so amazing in so many ways, the ruby slippers really are the unique creation of that work and they are pretty important to what makes that work unique.<br/><br/>Now, whether a movie from 1939 should be protected or in the public domain is another debate.
