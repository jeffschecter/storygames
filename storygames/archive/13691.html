Selene claims that she pulls the seas and the tides created the fertile area in which life was created. Also, her light provided the inspiration for man to create his own lights to see in the dark. Dike says that without her influence and moral standards, life would be a meaningless throw of the dice. Just then, in a tent on the plains, a baby is born to a nomadic tribe and the godesses enter into a wager as to who can have the most inflience on this child's life. One player is Selene, another Dike and a third the child. They will use the dice to determine the outcome of efforts to influence (fate) and efforts to dispense with the guiding hand of deities (hubris).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309691/#Comment_309691" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-26T07:15:36+00:00" title="January 26, 2011  7:15AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once upon a time a genial scientist <b>woke up</b> with a bad headache after having eaten a<b> weirdfish </b>during the previous meal. His head felt dull and <b>squary</b>, and his temples ached <b>as if someone had drilled holes in them</b>. <br/>Suddenly an <b>idea</b> came to him: that it was finally time to bring <b>justice</b> on an humanity so wicked as to serve weirdfish for supper. So humanity was doomed in his eyes and deserved no more opportunities to amend to their wickedness.<br/>He thus devised an enormous <b>magnet</b> to draw the <b>Moon</b> towards <b>Earth</b> and make it fall on it bringing Apocalypse on the wicked humanity, while he escaped the planet on his <b>rocket</b>, another genial invention. But he failed, because he forgot that gravity and magnetism aren't the same thing, and his rocket was in fact poorly designed at holding pressure and atmosphere whithin its ambient, as it flies through the interstellar void. So he horribly died during the rocket's launch and his evil plan never came to fruition.<br/>And the moral of this story is that weirdfish is not good for your health, so good kids never eat weirdfish, even if it colors your tongue a striped blue funny color.<br/><br/><br/>(I'm sorry if I ruined the mood...

This is me figuring it out as I type; I'm on my iPad so I'm typing a lot slower than normal.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'll go with the orientation of the picture as opposed to the "actual" top/bottom of the box.<br/><br/>So I see 3 elements grouped and would go with the first set being the past (origins of the situation), the second set being the present (the situation unfolding), and the third being the future (the likely outcome if things proceed without interference).<br/><br/>Past: Justice gone awry (scales on their side). It could be interpreted as just gone wrong (upside down scales), but a misdirected something feels better than something gone wrong (injustice). The map either seems to mean a world-influencing event, or a trip; it could also be a reference to the ocean. Light bulb seems to be either an idea or an invention.<br/><br/>Present: moon has lots of symbology (silver, impulse, emotion, feminine, awakening or even resurrection I think, as well as divination) and is in a "standard" position. We've got an inverted eye... If you want to go mystical, the eye could be something hidden or at least obscured. Otherwise I'd go with something lost, or something that's been searched for but is no longer sought. The magnet is sorta trickier... If you go with shape facing, then it'd count as "inverted" (opposite, relying on the usual shape position of the crescent moon) and would suggest repelling, rather than attraction.<br/><br/>Future: dice seems to mean chance or luck. Since it's in the future position and "luck" can be either good or bad based on how it seems to have influenced things, I'd go with chance. I've got no idea what that flask inside a flask thing actually is. But it makes me think of a nested doll or one of those ships inside a bottle. Fish puts me in mind of Pisces which is prosperity/virility, as well as the story of Jesus with the bread and fish; it's not in a normal/swimming position though, so that seems bad.<br/><br/>Hmmm... Taken all together, I guess I'd craft it as such:<br/><br/>In the past a great person was sent into exile; they hadn't commited a crime, but were no longer in favour. Along the way they disappeared; so far nobody has been able to find them and a few haven't made it back alive from their searching. The land is headed towards ruin and only they have the ability to prevent the famine that will inevitably follow.<br/><br/>Or....<br/><br/>A fantastical device was created and subsequently sent away, in an effort to keep it out of someone's hands/control. However, it was subsequently lost. Now, _something_ evil has come back and is corrupting the land. Research suggests that if this device could be found, it would either be able to contain the spread of corruption or possibly even the source of the corruption itself.<br/><br/>If you just wanted to go higgledy-piggledy I come up with...<br/><br/>A person is plotting revenge for the wrongful punishment they received. They plan to perform a ritual/procedure which will result in the death of a number of people, but will allow them to step back in time and try and right the wrong they suffered. And if they're successful, it will mean the future never happened and therefore the deaths didn't happen, so they're not _actually_ doing anything wrong, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
