And role-playing games were rare and expensive. We'd rarely get new games, and it was a big deal to try out something new. So:<br/>- High demand for new games<br/>- High supply of time<br/>- Low supply of money<br/>In this environment, spending time instead of money on getting your fun was a great deal for a role-player.<br/><br/>Now, we're grown-ups with jobs; we have more money, and less time to waste - we want fun <i>now</i>. And there are lots of good, cheap (even free) games out there. Game publishers are more or less begging for attention. So:<br/>- Low demand for new games<br/>- Low supply of time<br/>- High supply of money<br/>In this environment, spending time instead of money on getting your fun is a <i>terrible</i> deal for a role-player. <br/><br/>It's no surprise that the indie designers who are successful, are those who play their own games a lot with a lot of different people. It makes it very easy for others to try out the game (low time investment). This isn't necessarily positive for the state of RPGs as a whole, since being an active social networking person with single-minded focus on one single game doesn't necessarily mean you make good games. <br/><br/>It's also no surprise that word-of-mouth is so important: People want to know that a game is actually fun before they spend even five minutes looking at the rules. This is positive, as it helps good games get the attention they deserve.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that short games with high "bang-for-buck"-ratio are popular. With little time to spend, people want faster fun.<br/><br/>And, of course, it's no surprise that famous game designers sell more games. It's safer to buy from people who've given you fun in the past, than from unknowns. This might be positive, as it helps good designers keep on designing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160434/#Comment_160434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T07:10:05+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  7:10AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd agree with the caveat that some of us have less discretionary money now than when we were teenagers, because now we have to justify why we're not putting the money toward bills, kids, savings, retirement funds, etc. When I was a teenager making $500 a month with my part-time job, I could easily spend the whole amount on whatever, because I wasn't paying rent or anything else like that.

If a game takes relatively little time to go from reading -&gt; playing, the folks I know are all over new games.  It's like buying a new DVD.  You open the case, stick in it the machine, and *boom* fun happens.  It's the time investment that's a bigger deal than not wanting to learn new systems.  If I can grok a new system in 15 minutes, I'm sold.  If it's more than that, there has to be a big payoff that easily foreseen down the road; otherwise, it's much less likely to happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160451/#Comment_160451" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T09:38:10+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  9:38AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs speaks the truth.<br/><br/>Getting from "bought" to "played" is the largest marketing challenge for an RPG company.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160452/#Comment_160452" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T09:48:47+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  9:48AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget the time needed to explain the game to players who never read the game manuals (no matter how short), and their attention span (that decrease rapidly with age).

I run a lot of one-shot games at conventions and Endgame, and countless times I've had players tell me "I bought this and wanted to see how it works before I try running it myself" in addition to all the "I wanted to see what it was like before I bought a copy."  I've bought far more games than I've played.<br/><br/>Paul Tevis' podcast of his Polaris game convinced me to try playing it, although I'd owned a copy for some time.  Heck, even Dogs sat on my shelf for six months before I got around to reading it, although I ran it very soon after that.<br/><br/>I think it might be useful to have more podcasts of groups playing a game well, especially if it were a GM who really knew the game well, teaching it to new players.  Some people can learn a game by reading the text, and others are visual or auditory learners, or learn by doing.<br/><br/>I think part of marketing a game should be providing a good demo kit so that enthusiastic GMs can show others what it's like.  It'll come as no surprise that <em>Don't Rest Your Head</em> has such a kit, and it would be an excellent model for others. <em>Dogs</em> has a great demo, but as far as I know it's just tucked away in some random thread somewhere, so good luck finding it.  It comes with a great example town (Tower Creek), though.<br/><br/>One of the things that's kept me from running <em>Sufficiently Advanced</em> yet is the lack of a demo. Sure, I could make one myself, OR I could spend that time running several games of DRYH instead, with guaranteed fun instead of maybe-fun.<br/><br/>Seth Godin and Clay Shirky  both write very well about the advantages of leveraging the enthusiasm of your core supporters into bringing the good word to others:\n<blockquote><br/>"People don't believe what you tell them.<br/> They rarely believe what you show them.<br/> They often believe what their friends tell them.<br/> They always believe what they tell themselves."<br/>-- Seth Godin<br/></blockquote>\nProvide more ways for people to show their friends how good your game is!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160499/#Comment_160499" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T16:14:36+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  4:14PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anecdotaly, and looking at our community, we can't all be *that* short on time, because a vast number of us seem to have time to design new games, which takes a heck of a lot longer than just playing one.
