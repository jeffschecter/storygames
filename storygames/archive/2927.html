Its purpose is to better reflect the Lovecraftian world as I see it, and to avoid the CoC death spiral to a large extent. The system is based on Fudge/Fate, with a custom ladder.<br/><br/>The basic idea is that as characters encounter the truth about the universe, they accumulate unease about how accurate their worldview is, until a sudden revelation shifts their worldview quite dramatically. It uses two scores for this.<br/><br/><b>Confusion</b> measures the discordance between a character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s worldview and their experiences, on a scale of 1-100. The higher it is, the more acutely the character feels this mismatch.<br/><br/><b>Insight</b> represents how far their worldview has shifted from the human norm. It starts at the default value (Ordinary/3 in my game) and proceeds in discrete steps to the maximum (Legendary/8 in my system). It's a skill that can be used to understand phenomena that ordinary people find baffling. But it also acts as a social handicap. Each level of Insight above Ordinary gives a -1 on all social interactions, as people gradually perceive you as strange, even deranged. The price of insight is alienation.<br/><br/>Correspondingly, a strange event or encounter also has two values: Mystery and Weirdness. <b>Mystery </b>corresponds to Insight - how difficult this phenomena is to understand (Ordinary to Legendary or above). <b>Weirdness </b>(1-100) shows how disturbing it is \xe2\u20ac\u201c a measure of lack of subtlety, if you like. The more human-friendly forms of Nyarlathotep or Yog Sothoth would have high Mystery but low Weirdness. Equally, the more outrageous aliens (Flying Polyps) would have lower Mystery (it's just an alien) but quite high Weirdness (it's really obviously alien).<br/><br/>After the encounter is over (I don't like spoiling the moment with die rolls), match the character's Insight vs. the encounter's Mystery to see how well they can accommodate it in their worldview. If they want to roll on their Insight skill, they can (4dF, or d4-d4, etc.). <br/><br/>Not rolling means if it doesn't fit, the character just accepts that it doesn't make sense. Rolling means they try to make sense of it. If they roll well, they decide that there must be an explanation for it (up to the player what this might be). If they roll badly, the more they think about it, the less sense it makes.<br/><br/>If Insight (modified by the roll or not) is less than Mystery, they become more confused. Multiply the Weirdness by the degree of failure (1+) and add the result to their Confusion.<br/><br/><i>Example:</i> Jane meets a shoggoth (Mystery: Very Hard/7, Weirdness: 85). She's seen some odd things and has Insight: Decent/4. She rolls +1 on the dice. This gives her an effect Insight of 5 for the encounter. Degree of failure is thus 2. She adds (2x85=170) to her Confusion (ouch).<br/><br/>When Confusion goes over 100, add a level of Insight, and reduce Confusion by 100. Repeat as necessary. So Jane's Insight rises to Good/5 and her Confusion becomes 70, assuming it was zero before the encounter.<br/><br/>When a character moves up from one level of Insight to the next, they receive a Revelation, as their perspective shifts. The nature of the Revelation is partly a matter of taste. The GM can use it to impart some useful piece of information the character ought to know, or it can be something far more general about the nature of the universe. One useful approach might be to ask the player what they think is most bothering their character at the moment, and then shed some light on that. A realization that something they have been thinking (or assuming) up to now is wrong is especially appropriate. Suggestions on how to handle this would be very welcome. This might also be a good time to make a change in the character's Aspects.<br/><br/>Confusion can be reduced by healing environments, but Insight never drops. Once you've seen the truth, there's no going back. My current thinking is that PCs who reach Legendary Insight without being permanently locked up should probably be retired. <br/><br/>The social handicap provided by Insight has the useful effect of making it more likely that characters will take Consequences from social combat. This is where the phobias, etc. can come from. So PCs of high Insight may well prefer to avoid their fellow humans, apart from those who understand them reasonably well. The ultimate social combat is trying to convince the men in white coats that you're sane (or the witch-hunters that you're not a witch). This gets harder as Insight rises.<br/><br/>I also have some ideas for Uncanny Abilities to allow the Insight to be used for more things (Stunts, basically, the only ones in my system), but I'll stop there, as this is already quite long.<br/><br/>Does this seem workable? It's a little elaborate, but in many ways it's the most important thing in the game. Does it feel Lovecraftian? Are there practical problems I'm overlooking? Am I making any sense at all? I'm not sure how well I've explained it. It's quite simple, but seems to take a lot of words to get through!<br/><br/>All feedback appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66483/#Comment_66483" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T18:20:41+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  6:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>Are there practical problems I'm overlooking?</blockquote>\nBeware of multipliers.  If brand new PC Diane rolls a -4, for a total of -1, and a MoF of 8, then she gets 680 confusion, and jumps to 9 Insight.  Sure, a -4 is unlikely, but it still means that there events the attempt to comprehend can be an instakill.  <br/><br/>Barring strange edge effects, it does make sense, and puts Pickman-style characters within the realm of PC concepts.<br/><br/>The upshot: it has a nice feel, so long as you control for the upper ranges of things - either modify how things work (i.e. a failure doubles confusion, End Of Line) or carefully restrict the relationship between Mystery and Weirdness so that ((M+1) * W &lt; 400)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66491/#Comment_66491" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T19:17:14+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  7:17PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            in my first read through i rather like it.

My initial design sketch was using d4-d4, so I didn't think about -4 on the dice, but I think the use of Fudge dice is something I'd want to include nowadays. I also originally designed it so that seeing Azathoth et al. can be just as dramatic in effect as it can in CoC, but maybe that wasn't too clever, thinking about it. Your suggestions are good. Another would be to cap the maximum gain of Confusion from one encounter at 100 (the character has a terrible revelation, but remains exactly as confused as they ever were). Yet another: permit a new die roll with each increase in Insight, so that each time there is a chance of accommodating the event in the new worldview. So Diane would go up one Insight, then roll again. It wouldn't happen very often, so I think repeated die rolls would be OK here. And you'd need a series of really bad rolls for the insta-retirement effect.<br/><br/>I think at the moment I'm leaning towards the straight 100 cap as the most playable. But that's just a gut reaction.<br/><br/>I should maybe add that this mechanic is not supposed to have anything to do with the "your character is scared and runs away!" stuff. If that's required, it can be done using social combat mechanics to attack the character's Composure instead. Obvious, perhaps, but worth a mention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66508/#Comment_66508" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T02:56:32+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  2:56AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>And you'd need a series of really bad rolls for the insta-retirement effect.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Just in support of your already expressed preference - 'extremely unlikely' is still too often for a result that no one ever wants.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66509/#Comment_66509" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T03:08:12+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  3:08AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>'extremely unlikely' is still too often for a result that no one ever wants</blockquote>(big grin) Yes, rather obvious when you put it like that...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66540/#Comment_66540" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T07:31:24+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  7:31AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Dave,<br/><br/><span style="color: red;">The basic idea is that as characters encounter the truth about the universe, they accumulate unease about how accurate their worldview is, until a sudden revelation shifts their worldview quite dramatically.</span><br/><br/>My thoughts on your mechanic is that tracking state changes for characters only goes so far to hold a player's interest.<br/><br/>Zak Arntson was working similar thematic territory in Chthonian.

Interesting read. Actually, I read it once before, but I think the sense of it rather passed me by. I'll have to think about those ideas might be applied to a less "authorial" game, if you know what I mean. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>tracking state changes for characters only goes so far to hold a player's interest.</blockquote>An excellent point. I think in the case of Insight, that's not too much of a problem. Each increase in Insight brings a new ability that the PC didn't have before (they become more psychic, in essence), as well as imparting a Revelation, altering their Social abilities, and (I think) probably changing their Aspects too. (My current notion is to get them to swap one existing Aspect for one that reflects their new mindset, or a relationship with some alien entity, or something like that, so that they can see their old personality disintegrating and a new one replacing it.) Still, your suggestions to Zak have me thinking.<br/><br/>Confusion is more of a bare number (a bit like watching your SAN go down in CoC). And it would be nice to do something more with it, rather than just giving players a rough guide as to how desperate their character is for answers. If anyone has any suggestions, I'll be interested to hear them. Otherwise, food for thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66812/#Comment_66812" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T16:03:05+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  4:03PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An update: I asked Fred Hicks what he thought of this idea, and particularly about Confusion (1-100) not being very idiomatic in FATE terms. His suggestion was to use a wound track mechanism, which having thought about it for a day or so, is a cracking idea (thanks Fred!). It both enables the cap I said I wanted, and makes things more atmospheric and involving, to boot.<br/><br/>So: Instead of a simple Confusion score, have a wound track with (at least) three different rows. Something like: Odd Events/Weird Encounters/Inconceivable Phenomena, etc. I'm not sure how to determine how many boxes in each, but something like 12/6/3 might be OK.<br/><br/>Any encounter can be rated as one of these levels (replacing its Weirdness score) according to how blatant it is. Resolve Insight vs. Mystery as before, and tick off a number of boxes equal to the level of failure (if any). Extra ticks spill over into the next category as usual. So eventually the character has seen so many slightly odd things that now they form a pattern, and the next slightly odd thing strikes them far more heavily, etc. Eventually they go off the end of the last track, go up a level of Insight, and the track is wiped clean.<br/><br/>Some things could be rated Beyond the last track level, and unless you can understand them, they just immediately trigger an Insight change. Whether to wipe the track in this case, I'm not sure. I think probably yes.<br/><br/>Any comments?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
