<p>Okay guys ... everything I learned about decentralized, enthusiasm-based, empowered organizing came from the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1045&amp;page=4#Item_11" rel="nofollow">Go Play thread</a>.  So I blame you for sticking this idea in my head, and now I insist that you folks help me work out how to present it.</p>
<p>Over on the Forge they're having a thread about <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21000.0" rel="nofollow">how to improve the booth</a>.  People are very eager to find one or two leaders (characterized by their good ideas) and to organize behind those leaders.  People want to be <em>followers</em>.  They're dripping with enthusiasm to be followers.</p>
<p>I'm just basically not cool with that, and I'm doing a crappy job of explaining why.  It's not that it wouldn't work:  I'm sure it would work quite nicely.  It's that I think we could do <em>so much more</em> if everyone were creating their own cool ideas and executing them.</p>
<p>Picking <em>the best idea</em> and lining up behind it ... that makes sense in a world where it takes the concerted, full-time effort of many people in order to bring any idea to fruition.  But the Forge generally (making games all on our own) and Go-Play more recently (unconnected efforts that all came to a wonderful head) show that <em>we don't live in that world</em>.  We live in a world where we are each empowered to create tools for our community, and just to hand them out.</p>
<p>The old "get behind the leader" model is outdated.  But it's also <em>seductive</em>, because you get to be <em>lazy</em> and call it virtue.  You're not being a slacker, you're being a <strong>team player</strong>.  You're showing servant-leadership, and proactive synergy.</p>
<p>Blood-pressure ... rising.  Help me Story Games!  Help me figure out how to explain this issue (and to think about it) in a way that helps me to inspire people with how cool they can be, without harping on how cool they're <em>not being</em> at the moment.</p>

                            I think you answered your own question, Tony.  When these things work it is because people are energized, self-directed, and committed to openness and transparency.  The Go Play thing took off because people just went nuts in their own directions and shared what they made and learned in support of the general idea.  As you note, nobody planned or explained anything, they just did stuff.  <br/><br/>So the thing to do is to stop worrying about followers and start doing stuff to improve the booth, stuff that matters to you, and share what you do.  I started to do that with my script thread, which unfortunately went nowhere.  Shrug.  I'll try something else when I get a chance.  If other people latch on, tell them to take it and run with it but offer no support or organization.  This all reads as less than helpful but I feel your pain - I've just stayed out of it so far.                        </div>

<p>I just ... I feel like I am <em>undermining</em> the exact thing I want to achieve.  By doing stuff on my own I seem to be making it <em>less likely</em> that other people will do stuff on their own.</p>
<p>I go out there and say "Hey!  Check this out!  I don't need to follow anyone, I can just do my own thing and it will be helpful!"  Then people say "Oh cool!  Tony's doing something.  I could think of something myself, but I suppose I'd better just follow him instead," and suddenly <em>I'm the problem</em>.</p>

I also think you might be missing the fact that supporting someone else's good idea, isn't a bad thing.  As an example, take the Games on Demand idea at GenCon this year.  I thought it was an awesome idea.  So, I volunteered to man the table and support it.  Kat was in charge (it was her idea) and I followed her lead.  Could I have come up with another awesome idea and done that?  Sure.  But the GoD tables would have suffered for it.  In fact, if everyone who volunteered to help GoD had decided to do their own thing instead and not jumped in to support Kat's idea, the whole thing would have failed miserably because the idea needed more support than Kat could have possibly given it by herself.                        </div>

<p>Andrew:  Of course helping is a good thing.  But there's no dichotomy there.  You are not presented with the choice "Think up something cool on my own <strong>OR</strong> help someone else do something cool."  You can do both.</p>

                            Tony, who do you want to present it to? With respect to this goal, you have (in my glib taxonomy) the proactive, the supportive, and the passive. Are you trying to persuade all 3 camps to try and become more proactive, just the last two, or just the middle one? It sounds like you're just bothered about the supportives, but I want to be sure.<br/>[edit 4 clarity)                        </div>

                            Let me see if I get what you want...<br/>
<br/>
You essentially want people to participate in a large brainstorming activity where everyone brings their ideas to the table.  They even go start acting on these ideas.  Now, which ideas actually end up gaining enough support or gather enough momentum to stand on their own and succeed isn't the point at the moment.  You just want to see everyone getting their ideas out there instead of latching onto someone elses without contributing their own.<br/>
<br/>
Is that somewhat accurate?<br/>
<br/>
Just as a side note... I think your statement "Think up something cool on my own OR help someone else do something cool." You can do both. is true.  However, "Help someone else do something cool AND do my own cool thing." is not always a possibility.  Again... I could have decided to do my own cool thing at GenCon but I would not have had the time or energy to do the GoD tables AND something else that required similar commitment.  I do have to sleep at some point.   However, I could have thought up some other cool things and thrown them out there to see if someone else wanted to run with them.                        </div>

                            I dunno. I'm basically an evangelist at heart.  I enjoy following, but I'm just as happy to stand around and be enthusiastic at anyone who'll listen.  I think what you're looking for is evangelism: lots of people being charismatic and enthusiastic about the things that set them on fire, to the people who're inclined to listen.<br/><br/>But here's the thing.  Listeners are a part of that equation, right?  Listeners and followers aren't too different.  And the only way you get someone to get out of follower mode, I think, is to be an example to them as to how to be someone who's listened to.  Eventually some of them will start doing exactly what you want: going out and Doin' It Themselfs.                        </div>

<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>You essentially want people to participate in a large brainstorming activity where everyone brings their ideas to the table. They even go start acting on these ideas.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>No, actually.  That sounds like a really cool idea, but it's not what I'm aiming for.</p>
<p>I'm aiming, in fact, to <em>systematically cut out</em> the brainstorming-before-acting phase of things.  I'm saying let's not make everything a group project.  Let's make everything an individual project, with an awareness that it needs hooks for other people to add to it, if they want to.  Again ... think Go-Play.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how we publish books, for inspiration.  We start small ... within the resources we, personally, have on hand.  We don't hold off on publishing a book until we have enough outside investment to publish 5000 copies.  We scrape some money together and print 100 ... or we Lulu and print on demand.  In any event, during the time when we <em>would</em> have been trying to organize other people to help, we are instead selling games.  If nobody ever buys ... no biggie.  The project was worth the effort, and you can walk away with a useful experience.  If other people dump their resources in, they (a) get something concrete and immediate and (b) contribute to growing the size of the project (more print runs, etc).</p>
<p>I'd love to see people following the <em>same process</em> as regards our personal/volunteer projects.  I'll take GoD as an example, and talk about how it could have been done differently.  Not better, just differently.</p>
<p>Suppose Kat said "Okay, I'm going to provide some people with Games On Demand.  I'll do it for four hours on friday, and four on saturday.  If anyone else wants to use the same moniker and run tables, that's cool with me.  Here's the schedule of what's running, so we don't end up with five people in one slot and none in another.  If we get full coverage, great.  If not, that's cool too."</p>
<p>That's another way to organize ... one which doesn't require any help or public brainstorming or organizing before you take the first steps.  It just requires a willingness to do purely what you can do, and to feel that if that's all that happens, that's enough.</p>
<p>There are important constraints on what you can do within that context.  You obviously <em>cannot undertake</em> a project whose first useful step requires more resources (in terms of time, energy, money, whatever) than you personally can contribute.  But there is an absolutely huge amount that you <em>can do</em>, and there is really no conceivable downside.  It's a bootstrapping operation.  The worst that happens is you get to do a fun, personal project.</p>
<p>You can't build a cathedral on your own, but you <em>can</em> worship God on your own, and invite anyone who wants to join you.  If enough people do then the cathedral gets built.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Just as a side note... I think your statement "Think up something cool on my own OR help someone else do something cool." You can do both. is true. However, "Help someone else do something cool AND do my own cool thing." is not always a possibility. Again... I could have decided to do my own cool thing at GenCon but I would not have had the time or energy to do the GoD tables AND something else that required similar commitment.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Sure.  You can't do more than you can do on your own resources, and if those resources are already bespoke then you can't spend them twice.  But that just means you take on projects that don't require those resources.  I mean, seriously, how much time-at-Gencon did anyone put in to creating Go-Play stickers?  Maybe a few minutes distributing them.</p>
<p>The big projects that require assistance from everyone are not the only projects that can make a difference.  I'm a big fan of the projects that start with one person, an idea, and a willingness to fail.</p>

                            So you're telling people, basically, to be creative, and do it largely without any initial support? <br/><br/>Of the people who come to The Forge with a game idea, how many actually end up publishing their game? Of those, how many actually do it without following the Forge model, which includes getting lots of help from Forge people? <br/><br/>Er, you're asking everyone to be prodigy's. <br/><br/>Further, I, personally, am one of those team player people. I think that the leader/follower model works better. Because anyone who isn't inspired to be a prodigy then helps those who are. <br/><br/>You seem to believe that if one ever follows that they will never lead. Napoleon was a corporal to start out. <br/><br/>I think you're seeing a problem that doesn't exist, and proposing a solution to it that's completely impractical. It's just like on The Forge when somebody says something like, "Dudez, there should be a glossary." Well, it only gets made if you make it. Suggesting that other people do more simply doesn't get anything done ever. <br/><br/>OTOH, if you do go and do something yourself, you just might inspire others to be the same. I think that leading by example to show people to be their own leaders is about as good as you're going to get. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

<p>Mike:  What has this got to do with the word "prodigy"?  I'm not asking anything prodigious.  I'm simply asking people to do stuff on their own.  The whole point is that it doesn't have to be big stuff.  The examples I've held up aren't "Create a grand unified theory of physics" they're "Make a web-page" and "Print some stickers."  Do you think that such self-starting actions are <em>beyond the ability</em> of most folks?</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with people who want to follow.  Helping each other <strong>rocks</strong>.  Go ahead and help out with someone else's project.  Just don't let that stop you from <em>also leading</em>.  It's easy.  Go do it!  Go Play!  Go Help!  Go Inspire!  Go DO!</p>

                            So, I've got a question: What about people who just aren't as creative?  Who actually <i>need</i> the brainstorming sessions to even come up with and flesh out an idea?  I must admit I'm one of these people.  I work a lot better when I can work <i>with</i> other people and bounce ideas off of them.  They can come up with stuff that I never will!  For me, group work is the way to go.  This means I'll practically *never* go out there and just do something.<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

                            Great thread, and it reflects exactly the frustrations I'm having in another community I'm part of, where ideas never seem to come to anything because people lack time, energy and organization. My approach has gradually evolved to:<br/><br/>* If I have an idea that I can do on my own with nobody's support, and that I want to do because I want to do it - I do it. If anyone later picks it up, uses it, joins in, builds on it - that's jam. I make sure I leave hooks for people to do these things (like Tony's description of how Kat could have run GoD).<br/><br/>* If I see someone else doing something that I think I can engage with or build on, and they're offering that opportunity, I do that too.<br/><br/>* If I have an idea that requires other people to join in in order to make it fly - I toss it out into the wild and see if it thrives. If so, cool. If not, well, I have three or four ideas a week which would take a month each to implement. Plenty more where those came from.<br/><br/>* If I have a project that I'm working on, and other people's input would really improve it, I ask the people I'm connected with for their comments. They don't have to "work on the project" with me, they just have to look at what I've done and bounce suggestions. This improves my ideas <i>notably</i>. This is my answer to Nancy's question: I say, "Hey, I thought of this, I'm planning to do it, what's your reaction?" Nobody feels like responding will <i>commit them to anything</i>, but they get a degree of involvement and ownership. This is basically what the Go Play thread did, too.                        </div>

                            I think what you may be looking for is more of a primer. because if you don't speak "forge" you might as well just fuck right off. no one, and by that I mean no one I met, was interested in explaining any of the lexicon in a concise clear form. even the FAQs were 100% jargon with zero explanation.<br/><br/>My wife, who is a technical writer, literally laughed out loud and asked if any of these people had ever been taught how to write.

                            Ross: the possible irony of your post thrills me to my cynical core, but did you read this thread beyond the subject line, prior to posting? It's not about explaining Forge jargon, it's about explaining the merits of different organizational methods in a thread on the Forge. Am I missing some way in which that relates?<br/><br/>Tony: I do think you're being a little disingenuous by constantly bringing up the Go Play stickers. As you've pointed out, they're sticker and t-shirt designs -- they don't require a very significant effort or commitment. I'm not suggesting that it wasn't a great idea, but it's pretty rare to find an idea that is both very investment-flexible and is also awesome and useful. Go Play also had the advantage that it didn't actually have to solve any problems -- it was more about creating opportunities. If you're trying to get an idea specifically to solve issues like booth organization, game demos/exposure, etc., it's not surprising to me that people are looking to focus their efforts. There's more at stake, and the scale of the problems suggests that they cannot be solved by a single person. (This latter is not an argument for or against either 'side', since the concern seems to be about how to mobilize multi-person efforts.)                        </div>

Try getting a BA in western philosophy from a university which prides itself on the fact that its undergrad philosophy program is as vigorous as most MA programs.

And every generation (and often writer) has their own jargon that changes meaning depending on which year they said it).

Ah!  Good point!  Possibly unintentional, but a good point.  That phrase "very investment-flexible and also awesome and useful" is, in fact, a terrific way to describe what I think we should be trying harder to create.<br/><br/>I think that the idea that they're pretty rare in any <i>objective</i> sense is probably flawed.  They are discovered rarely because people aren't looking for them.  I think we should consciously look for them more.  Their power is easy to underestimate.<br/><br/>Oh, and Andy ... you were right on the patience thing.  These ideas seem to be sprouting up with greater frequency:  Jonathon Walton's <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21000.msg217796#msg217796" rel="nofollow">brilliant little</a> idea of running the demoing the same situation in different game systems, for instance, is a natural self-starter.  Nathan has jumped in to invent and head <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21053.0" rel="nofollow">organized playtesting</a> at Dreamation.  I guess what I mostly needed to do was chill out and wait.<br/><br/>I'm still interested in hearing better ways to word what's going on, if only to have better words to praise people for what they're doing.                        </div>

                            Many people prefer to be followers. If they're happy as followers, let them be happy.  So long as you're not closing a door, eventually if they feel like it they'll step through. They're not children. They don't have to be taken by the hand and taught that it's okay to do their own thing.                        </div>

                            Sorry it took so long to get back here.<br/><br/>Tony, don't think me a misanthrope when I say this. But suddenly coming up with some idea to do that has the energy to actually get you off your ass and actually do that thing? That's prodigious. I was the only person at GenCon selling the Go Play stickers for charity. I'd mentioned it to other folks and hoped they'd do it at the Forge Booth. They didn't. Now, I could call em slackers (or myself for not having taken more time to get them to do it), but inertia is a fact of life. I think that we all are doing a great job as it is. I'm not sure where I could have done more at GenCon than I did, as it happens. <br/><br/>Does the energy barrier seem lower to you than I describe it? Well, Tony, most folks aren't like you. Like Luke, you've simply got way more energy than most people do. <br/><br/>Again, I don't think that makes other people bad, it makes them normal. I just think that it's unrealistic to think that simply by exhorting people to do more that this will produce anything. Put another way, I think that they already will get inspired to do things. Telling them to get more inspired? <br/><br/>I wish I knew how. <br/><br/>But, hey, if you think it's helping... no reason to stop I suppose. You probably have enough energy to keep trumpeting this and still do whatever else it is that you plan to do. And, heck, under the "even if one person..." sort of criteria, you're probably right to try. Who knows. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>
