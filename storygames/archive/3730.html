In our case, probably a TSOY hack.  I'm thinking about genre emulation and Keys, and it occurred to me that maybe it would be fun to have what are essentially negative Keys.  These would push counter-survival behaviors, and the reward would be dispersed.  Here's an example:<br/><br/><b>KEY OF TERROR (group experience) <br/>\xe2\u20ac\u0153Oh sweet Jesus, help me!\xe2\u20ac\x9d <br/><br/>1 bonus die to share for being terrified. <br/>3 bonus dice to share for refusing to help because you are afraid. <br/>5 bonus dice to share when your fear gets someone killed. <br/><br/>Buyoff: Face your true fear. </b><br/><br/>The XP from hitting the Key is immediately dispersed to other players as the Key of Terror guy sees fit, as bonus dice - which the recipients can use or hoard.  This would be how bonus dice appear - they are never free in this hack.  Otherwise, they work normally.  This would lead to a lean bonus die economy and encourage cinematic failure, which both seem appropriate.  Maybe the GM gets bonus dice the old-fashioned way.  <br/><br/>Talk to me about the pitfalls and delights of such an approach!  I have this lingering worry that I can't articulate ...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83632/#Comment_83632" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T07:50:23+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  7:50AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2007 7:50AM by DanielSolis.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat. I too have been wondering about how keys can facilitate more group interaction in a manner similar to the Scrips and Thematic Batteries in FLFS.<br/><br/>The tricky thing is that earning GXP for an internal emotion, as is the case for the 1 GXP condition. 3 GXP and 5 GXP look like they'd work because they cause some actual in-game action or inaction, with the resulting consequences leading to further interesting play. What's something that you could <i>do</i> out of fear to earn 1 GXP?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83633/#Comment_83633" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T07:53:30+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  7:53AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point, they need to be written to avoid any passivity.  But they will, in some cases, be entirely internal.  Here's another:<br/><br/><b>KEY OF OBSESSION (group experience)<br/>\xe2\u20ac\u0153I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t care if he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s infected, I won\xe2\u20ac\u2122t abandon a God-damned child!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>You have an unreasoning attachment to an object, person, or idea.  It is the focus of your concerns and actions.  <br/><br/>1 bonus die to share for keeping the thing you are obsessed with safe.  <br/>2 bonus dice to share for convincing another to obsess with you.<br/>5 bonus dice to share for risking your life or the lives of others in service to your obsession.<br/><br/>Buyoff:  Abandon or destroy the object of your obsession.</b><br/><br/>This is sort of like Key of the Mission.  If the thing you are keeping safe is "civilization", it becomes inward-focused and passive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83634/#Comment_83634" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-27T08:00:32+00:00" title="July 27, 2007  8:00AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tokyo Heroes, my sentai (Power Rangers) game (which will get a massive overhaul whenever I have the time, which could be quite a while) has something like that. Characters get one Key of their own, and two Team Keys that represent what all of them have in common as a team. One of them is "Pride," so that the team can get extra dice for standing around and doing goofy poses, even when it gives the monster of the week an opening to attack. Unfortunately I haven't yet playtested it enough to see if there are any real problems with this approach, though I am planning to make it the players' responsibility to ask for dice rather than the GM's to keep track of everyone's Keys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
