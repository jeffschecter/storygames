I'll post details about it in a bit, but I had some questions first:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen is Iron Game Chef 07?  I don't want to compete with that madness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're making a D&amp;D; adventure thingy, dudes really ought to play it.  Is there any way to recruit playtesters for such things?  Like, groups of playtesters, each doing one of the submissions?  I have no idea how many people have an active D&amp;D; group goin'.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also like these things to be hosted somehow, but I have no web-hosty magic...<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe this was a bad idea, but in principle I think it might be a fun contest, and I'd like to see what all the SG-heads do, when they're all grinding away at something Gamist like D&amp;D;, which is like the chicken noodle soup to gamers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_57893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/57893/#Comment_57893" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-02-23T13:38:28+00:00" title="February 23, 2007  1:38PM">February 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds interesting to me James<br>Last i heard GC was in the Early March timeframe                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
