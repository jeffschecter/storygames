We grabbed 30-35 people, mixed them up, rented space, and now we're going to play 5-6 session RPG mini-campaigns every other Friday night. <br/><br/><b>The point\u2026</b><br/><br/>We went back and forth discussing GM tips\u2026 a lot of which I'm sure you've heard before\u2026 but a few were less common bits of wisdom. 1 tip was really obvious in retrospect but I haven't seen it mentioned much and has worked wonders for me\u2026<br/><br/><i>"Bored? Have monsters burst through a door and attack!"</i><br/><br/>Not that but in the same vein\u2026<br/><br/><i>"Nervous? Introduce an NPC that's nervous and talk in character how nervous you are."</i><br/><br/>It works! <br/><br/>My fallback is an NPC who is new to their job or is coming out of retirement and is nervous because they haven't done this in a while. You almost immediately feel more relaxed and as a bonus often the players become more empathic to you and your NPC. <br/><br/>What uncommon, often not quoted in books, GM tips do you use?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318139/#Comment_318139" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T02:58:31+00:00" title="March 30, 2011  2:58AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NPCs who fit the stereotypes of "I'm too old for this shit." and "Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in."<br/><br/>And the every popular "favor for a dying friend."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318227/#Comment_318227" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-30T15:59:25+00:00" title="March 30, 2011  3:59PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2011 3:59PM by stefoid.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its a lot easier for everybody concerned to deal with acknowledged nervousness rather than unacknowledged nervousness, so just acknowledge it up front.  Your 'nervous NPC' is a way of doing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
