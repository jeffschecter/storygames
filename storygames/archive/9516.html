This reroll gets a number of boxes depending on the length of game you want to play - maybe 3 or even 1 for a one-off, 5 for a 2-3 session story, more for greater length, but always an odd number.<br/><br/>Unlike the other rerolls, this one doesn't need to refresh and can be used as many times as desired until the Identity of the Blade Runner is established. Every time a player chooses to use Identity for a reroll they assign either Human or Replicant to success or failure <i>before</i> rolling. The result fills in an Identity box with an H or a R for Human and Replicant respectively, depending on the assigned result of the reroll, and representing gathering evidence for one identity or the other. Once the clear majority of boxes are filled in with one result, a scene must follow shortly after where the character is revealed as either a human or replicant. Whether this is an end for the character as playable or not I guess depends on the game, but my feeling is this would signal the bowing out of that character since they no longer straddle the no-man's land of being definitively either human or replicant.<br/><br/>For example, Deckard has 5 boxes of Identity and 2 are already filled in 'R'. He gets in a fight with Pris and is losing, so decides to use Identity for a Combat reroll, assigning success to Replicant (He succeeds because his replicant body is tougher than a human's should be). He rolls, but fails again. He fills in his third box with a 'H' and the mystery of Deckard's identity continues - if he'd succeeded, with 3 out of 5 boxes filled with an R he'd need a scene shortly where he's revealed as a replicant. Perhaps something involving origami creatures from his dreams?<br/><br/>Workable? Good idea? Bad one?<br/><br/>The nice thing I think is that if a character wants to keep their character's true identity a mystery, then they stop using the reroll before hitting the point when this becomes certain. The player can also strongly influence the outcome by choosing tactically whether to assign success or failure to which identity - if you'd like a human end to the character's story for instance, regularly assign 'replicant' to the low chance of success side of the roll (Social for instance, where human empathy might plausibly represent success and a replicant's difficulty with this explaining the failure).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211091/#Comment_211091" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T12:14:05+00:00" title="June  9, 2009 12:14PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conceptually interesting.

Ralph, you're right - when it comes right down to it, any player with a strong preference is essentially just choosing the outcome. <br/><br/>I'm trying to cater for both the player who comes to the point where he or she <i>knows</i> during the game that their character is, absolutely, going to end up a replicant or a human and to a player seeking a more exploratory approach - personally, and especially at the early parts of a game, I like the idea of being (potentially) surprised by the outcomes, and the random element appeals.<br/><br/>I think the simpler approach, deciding whether the reroll will clock up a replicant or a human box check regardless of the success of the roll, may be the way to go. <br/><br/>However, I really dislike games where the GM interprets the consequences of character action when this infringes on the internal psyche of a character. I could never quite get comfortable with (for example) Humanity in either Sorcerer or WoD Vampire. I'd definitely go with Darcy's suggestion of the GM flagging the identity consequence <i>before</i> the decision to reroll is taken, and the player deciding accordingly.<br/><br/>To keep the mysterious element, maybe each tick each way affects a final die roll?  Eg. 5 boxes, each box is worth 2 points, so 3 human ticks and 2 replicant give a number of 6 or less for the character to be a human? All ticks of the same kind removes the random element altogether.<br/><br/>Seems a bit unsatisfying, however, with everything loaded into a final die roll. <br/><br/>OR, a lot more interestingly, each box ticked is a vote for the character being a replicant or a human. On top of that, each <i>other</i> player (including the GM) adds a secret vote based on their impressions of what would be cool as an outcome. <br/><br/>OR each time a box is ticked every player secretly votes one way or the other and the votes are revealed when the final box is ticked - that would, however, give the player a lot less control over their character's fate but on the other hand puts the onus on them to frame the reroll in such a way that one or other conclusion is strongly implied.<br/><br/>I do really like that last one, although there's some book-keeping involved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211139/#Comment_211139" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T14:03:10+00:00" title="June  9, 2009  2:03PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of one vote, when the last box is ticked, and thus the boxes are really just a record, a reminder to others. After all, I might think something you did for a reroll is so very Replicant-y that the other, minor (in my mind) rerolls don't sway my vote, regardless of the box totals. And yet, the box totals have a certain weight relative to the other players' votes: if there are more boxes than players, and they are all Replicant (or human) then our vote won't matter.<br/><br/>I am less jazzed about the vote-every-reroll, because of the handling time and because of your expressed concern that it over-weights the players' votes.<br/><br/>I don't like any GM fiat stuff, so "the GM decides" is crap, to me. Suppose we play GM-less--now we have to vote every time (or assign the decision arbitrarily, like "the player to the left" or "a random player not in the scene").<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Perhaps you could consider allowing a revealed Replicant to continue play, rather than just go off-screen or become an NPC? Is the "straddl[ing] no-man's land" the whole kernel of play, in your mind (seems you're open to at least SOME play where they persist as PCs)? If not, then allies and friends become hunters; there are desperate attempts to get away from the hunters; maybe even room a Duel-Of-Wits-type mechanic for getting folks to give you the time and space to flee; perhaps even an epilogue scene of one's last days of joy... or fear: that was the tear-jerking shit at the end (with Roy's final choice in life and if you come to the conclusion that Deckard was a Replicant).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211384/#Comment_211384" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T11:39:22+00:00" title="June 10, 2009 11:39AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I keep wanting to post to this thread, and being held back by the shameful fact I haven't played Tears in Rain yet.  It's on my bucket list!<br/><br/>But, as a big (Phillip K.) Dick-head, the whole question of man vs. machine, human vs. artifact, independent vs. controlled is a question that cuts through everything and doesn't get resolved till the end -- if then.  So my gut instinct is that resolving the question in play would drain some of the resonance out of the game... what does it add to the game to find out Biggs isn't a Replicant, she's just a cold-blooded killer?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211443/#Comment_211443" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T14:39:53+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  2:39PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crap - I just wrote a long answer then had the whole thing disappear...<br/><br/>David, my thoughts are largely like yours at the moment. The way I think I'll go is:<br/><br/>* An Identity track of (by default) 5 boxes<br/><br/>* Each time Identity is used for a reroll, the player narrates suitable in game fiction and fills in a box with either an H or a R<br/><br/>* When the track is full, add up the number of each R or H and each player adds a vote. The result determines whether the character is a replicant or not.<br/><br/>* The GM (with player input) frames a revelation scene to take place pretty soon. After the fallout from this scene has been resolved, the player describes an epilogue and the character is retired from the game (possibly recurring as an NPC)<br/><br/>The number of Identity boxes could be increased or decreased, but the weighting of votes might need tinkering with. I think an ideal ratio of track votes to player votes should be 5:3 or 5:4. For a 10 box game, player votes might be worth double, for a 3 box game, box votes could be worth double.<br/><br/>Regarding whether the character can still be played after their identity question has been resolved, I think it should work a bit like Doom in Conspiracy of Shadows, and mean the end of the character's playability, for two reasons:<br/><br/>1) In Trollbabe the protagonists exist in the space between trolls and humans, existing in neither camp but intrinsically linked to both. As written, Bladerunners in <i>Tears in Rain</i> don't really exist in this space, as, while the question is referred to in the text, the Bladerunners' tasks puts them firmly in the human camp, charged with exterminating the replicants. Bringing in a mechanical crutch for the Identity question puts that uncertainty further into the forefront of the game - it can be ignored, or never conclusively resolved (4 boxes ticked out of 5), but it's there as an open question throughout. Sort of like the 'Hatred of Home' flashback in 3:16. Once this question is resolved, the character cannot exist in the no-man's land, they are identified with one camp or the other.<br/><br/>2) As Danny said, P K Dick's writing regularly revolves around questions of what it means to be human. In 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'the question of whether Deckard is human or replicant is conclusively answered by the end of the book, despite some red herrings along the way. If the game is to echo the same themes I don't think a character has enough legs to continue for long after the question has been confronted and resolved.<br/><br/>Danny, I'm not sure if you're arguing for retiring characters after the question's been resolved, in which case I agree, or arguing against a mechanic to address the question in the first place. If the latter, I'd argue that Dick's 'Do Androids Dream...' does resolve the question and Deckard is able to kill the final replicants precisely because he's human, something the inhuman replicants cannot account for: they think that if he sleeps with the body double of one of his targets, he won't be able to go through with retiring her. Deckard shows that being human sometimes means doing something that denies everything that particular human values. He's a killer, but he's certainly not cold-blooded about it.<br/><br/>It's a different case in the movie. Deckard's identity is a sideshow to the main theme of what makes a human human, and while there are clues in there, it really doesn't matter if he's human or not. I'm aiming for something that can be used to echo 'Do Androids Dream...' or 'Bladerunner', or a mixture of the two - the question can be resolved, hinted at or ignored completely, depending on the preference of the individual player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211740/#Comment_211740" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T16:09:32+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  4:09PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2009 6:51AM by Per_Fischer.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a wonderful thread, I just wish I knew how to contribute...<br/><br/>As Adrian says, I hinted at the Blade Runners' flux between human and replicant in the text, and it was actually my (sorry) excuse for taking Trollbabe's premise to this setting.

On the plus side, there's the mechanical temptation to edge towards being a replicant to ensure the success of conflicts you care about, but on the (for me) slightly negative side, it removes the clear character arc for human characters - while they can always move toward certain replicant-hood, they can't ever establish their authentic humanity. <br/><br/>However, that might not matter that much anyway - it could be a rule that the player of any character not having used all their 'replicant' boxes up could choose to die or retire as a human at the player's decision, should they wish to establish this as fact, or alternatively, that it's just a feature of the game that absolute proof of humanity cannot be established.<br/><br/>One area this may fall down is the power of the reroll to tempt a player into crossing off a replicant box: since rerolls are available in other ways, there may not be an awfully strong temptation to resort to the replicant re-rolls.<br/><br/>Hmm... I think I'm at the point where I'll have to try it in practice to see what works well or not.

They love, hate, feel remorse, cry, they ask existential questions. It's a world turned upside down.

I think 'Do Androids Dream...' and Bladerunner can be viewed kind of like two different games of Tears in Rain:<br/><br/>In the novel version, the theme that emerges is fed into by the fact that the replicants are less-than human without true empathy (for the most part anyway), but also that the humans have become less human due to technology (mood devices. etc.) - so it does very much matter that Deckard is a human, otherwise you just get a murderous android murdering other murderous androids.<br/><br/>Bladerunner, on the other hand, establishes that the human/replicant division is no longer valid with the Nexus 6 models, and the Bladerunners are persecuting the replicants. Sympathy sits firmly with the replicants by the film's end.<br/><br/>In both cases, if they were a game, these things shouldn't (IMO) have been evident at the game's outset, but develop into a full theme by the end of the game - perhaps in your game it turns out that to catch a replicant you need to be a replicant (e.g. Deckard's implied replicant status in the film), perhaps in another's the theme deals with how fundamentally replicants will never understand humans (e.g. Rachel sleeping with Deckard in 'Do Androids...' to try and use his human empathy against him. It doesn't work, and Rachel is confused by that), otherwise you're in danger of playing a game that just rehashes the conclusions of the film (or book).<br/><br/>So all the Identity track is intended to do is to push that question of replicant vs. human mechanically into the game, and keep it at the forefront - whether the answers need be definitive, central to the game's theme or peripheral, or anything else, should only come out at the game's end, otherwise you're just replaying the book, or the movie.<br/><br/>I really think it's something I'll have to try and see how it works out in play. Like others here, I have concerns that it could be too unsubtle a tool, but on the other hand it could be a really cool way of reinforcing the question in players' minds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212227/#Comment_212227" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-14T13:01:27+00:00" title="June 14, 2009  1:01PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2009 1:23PM by Adrian P.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited: Removed my softer compromise.

When (or if) the final box is filled out, the character's story is about to resolve in some final way, with a subsequent epilogue.<br/><br/>The change is that when the final box is filled in, the player chooses whether or not to uncover the truth about their character:<br/><br/>- if they choose not to, the character's identity is left ambiguous as they flee off into the sunset/lie in a pool of their own blood, dying/quit their job for good, etc., like Deckard's in the movie.<br/><br/>- if they choose to reveal the truth, as many votes as there are Identity boxes are divided amonget the players: uneven splits favour the controlling player, then the other players, and finally the GM  - e.g. 5 votes amongst 3 players: 2 for each player and 1 for the GM; 4 votes amongst 3 players, 2 for the controlling player, 1 each for the other player and GM. <br/><br/>- The votes of players <i>and</i> those from the filled in boxes are tallied, with the controlling player casting the deciding vote in the case of a tie.<br/><br/>- During the resolution scene and/or epilogue, the player must definitively reveal the true identity of their retiring character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
