<p><em>Note: This is x-posted RPGnet. Think you can do better? Yes, that's a friendly challenge.</em></p>
<p>I'm starting a game of nWoD Mage soon. The GM tried to have each of us have unique paths and Vices, and I chose the Path of Obrimos and the Vice of Greed. (If you're not familiar, Obrimos is the path of those Mages who have been Awakened to their powers by some Divine Entity; this definitely feels like the crusader archetype.) Our cabal's Order is the Free Council - a generally hippying pro-enlightenment bunch of mages, more or less. Or to put it more shortly: we're not tools.</p>
<p>So that's what I know, but I'm still trying to flesh out a really good feel for my story, and possibly a good suggested Virtue to take here. I'd love to riff off your ideas!</p>
<p>What I'm thinking so far: my character is the priest of a church filled up primarily of Haitian immigrants in a run-down part of Boston. (If you've ever seen those churches that take up residence in those unused storefronts, that's what I'm talking about.) I'm thinking it's a mostly Catholic service, with just an undertone of [URL="<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voudoun" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voudoun</a>"]voudoun[/URL] (if you know how to listen for it). The style of this is ideally not like campy Hollywood voodoo, but a bit more subdued, perhaps a bit more like the actual faith even.</p>
<p>He is Awakened and feels compelled to protect his parish and his local people, but he's also quite Greedy, in the sense of wanting to accumulate as much as he can for his church, with the self-justification that he's trying to use it to keep people safe (but at this point, he's still hoarding it for its own purpose). I'm thinking that not too long ago, he made a point of urging people to doublecross some local criminals affiliated with organized crime, leading to the murder of the guilty criminals - but also the pocketing of a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with the hope to parley this into still more power.</p>
<p>I'm not totally sure what would be a good Virtue to have here, and what other good character hooks to add onto this. Would the Virtue of Charity be a good counterpoint to Greed, or would a more traditional Fortitude or Faith be better? What was his life beforehand? (Perhaps he was a failed businessman - the source of his greed?) How is he trying to save everyone (since he is on the path of the crusader)?</p>
<p>I'm basically looking for some more ideas of where to drive this character to make the upcoming game really sing. I know that each of the other four players represents one of the other sins (except for Lust and Sloth) and that the Seven Deadly Sins will be a part of the coming game. The other players are evenly distributed amongst the other Paths.</p>
<p>Let me know if I can clarify any details or WoD-specific things.</p>
