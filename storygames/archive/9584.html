Traits can be used to accomplish something <i>really well</i>, to do better than expected, etc, as well as checked for an extra card in a conflict. Both of these count toward number of uses, and once you're out of uses of a trait, to use it again you've got to spend Fanmail (or refresh it). When I played no one ever checked off a trait except during a conflict.<br/><br/>Am I reading the rules right? I didn't see anything that assigns responsibility for saying during free narration "Hey, don't you think that's a use of Rocketbike?" Is it the Producer's job? The player's? Once you're checked out of Rocketbike, it also seems to mean that you should cut way down on Rocketbike narration, 'cause you can't check it for an awesome result.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
