They dive to the rescue, ramming one slug with their car and saving some other drivers, but a fire breaks out! Luckily, they save all the bystanders, but the RCBC collapses due to gross structural damage! In addition, Arwun malfunctions due to a device implanted in him without his knowledge in his 'Previously On...' and begins advertising 'silky lingerie' to the assembled populace!<br/>\n<br/>\nInterlude #1: On the Carpet<br/>\nOur heroes get chewed out by Col. Makeshift at DPHQ and are ordered into the sewers to find the source of the slugs. Arwun is rebooted but the device inside him is not actually removed...<br/>\n<br/>\nAction #2: The Sewers<br/>\nWe join our hopelessly lost heroes wandering the sewers, pinned by a giant slug at one end of the tunnel and a swarm of baby slugs at the other! Even as they defeat these, more slugs appear! Eventually, they find their way into the nest of the Mother of All Slugs, from which strange silky threads are being spun... They defeat it, but at a high cost: the acid explosion caused by killing the Slug Mother destroys the foundations of the building above them, which collapses into the sewers! As it falls down, they read the sign on it which says "Temporary Rocket City Beauty College"!<br/>\n<br/>\nInterlude #2: The Bar<br/>\nA shamed Vincent Limelight goes to drown his sorrows... in an ice-cream parlour, of course! Whilst there, he is recognised by Dr. Atlanta, head of the Sunshine Cosmetic Products company, which sponsors not only the RCBC but also the upcoming fashion show which was to have been held there. In a gesture to placate Dr. Atlanta, Col. Makeshift offers the use of DPHQ to hold the show instead! Our heroes are assigned to the security detail for the show...<br/>\n<br/>\nAction #3: The Catwalk<br/>\nA bevy of Rocket City's loveliest supermodels are on the catwalk in DPHQ's main reception hall, when the daring &amp; silky lingerie they are wearing begins to sparkle with an unmarsly green light... Vincent recognises the material of the lingerie as being made from acid slug silk! He bravely attempts to bring down the supermodels on the catwalk, but is hit by a mind control ray and falls helplessly in love with the brunette! Meanwhile, backstage, the leader of the supermodels bursts through the back wall... the Ubermodel! Arwunn fights her, eventually bringing down both her and her blonde and redhead cohorts. Unfortunately, he is not in time to save his friend from the clutches of the brunette, who takes him away to a nearby broom closet for forced mating! After doing so, she breaks through the floor into the sewers...<br/>\n<br/>\nTO BE CONTINUED..?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe ran the game using the modified rules for x2 and x3 skill dice in the 'KO'ed' and 'Vaporised' boxes, but it was hard to see if this made a lot of difference. Only Dave got his danger meter that high and almost immediately rolled 7 danger with no hits! This included his 3d12, so it was very much at the hard end of the probability curve, which is why I was soft on him and had him abducted for forced mating rather than vaporised.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe abilities got a good outing, particularly Dave's Danger is my Middle Name, which was the only source of hits he got on some rolls, particularly the last one mentioned above. Jef's Critical Strike only came in once, against the Slug Mother (it would really benefit from being able to get more than 2 people at a time to play the game!) but the Detachable Flying Head saw lots of duty!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also quite pleased with my slug generating strategy: the 'Lost in the Sewers' threat popped out an acid slug if they didn't do anything about it, but if they tried to find their way through and got 3 Danger... another slug popped out! I started with 2 slugs but I think they went through 4 in total before finding the Slug Mother, which was staged behind the 'Lost' threat (I just wrote it on the back of the card and turned 'Lost' over to 'Mother of All Slugs' when they beat the former)<br/>\n<br/>\nJef also suggested something like random event cards, for when inspiration escapes us; maybe some kind of random deck you could draw from instead of adding a danger die to your pool? Some of the cards would benefit the players, some would hinder them, but all of them would add additional colour to the scene.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229546/#Comment_229546" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T07:07:47+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  7:07AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Mullen</cite>(I just wrote it on the back of the card and turned 'Lost' over to 'Mother of All Slugs' when they beat the former)</blockquote>\nAwesome idea.

Any advice for other Patrollers on how to handle those?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, just take it naturally. The three priorities are: reincorporation, reincorporation, reincorporation. Jef &amp; Dave pretty much flowed straight from action to interlude to action without missing a beat, because the interludes were natural consequences of the action (you let the Rocket City Beauty College be destroyed, so your commanding officer tears you off a strip) and the action scene just picked up from where the interlude suggested, but in media res again (you get ordered to track the slugs into the sewers, so the action starts when you are already well along with that scene and up to your neck in acid slugs!).<br/>\n<br/>\nJef &amp; Dave are both veterans of several InSpectres games, so they are quite used to the idea of making up plots and colour on the fly and having the random details sewn togther to make a coherent plot thread. Say what first comes into your head, don't overthink it and don't try to 'outcool' anyone else, just let the story write itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd include slugs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229695/#Comment_229695" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T15:25:34+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  3:25PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent advice, James!
