Think about it, tons of nerds with no sleep, lots of booze and/or caffeine, and easily-provoked nerd rage are just a fiasco waiting to happen. So I put together a playset, drafted some friends to help me test it, and after some minor tweaks I can happily say that it is ready to be released into the wild:<br/><br/>Some highlights from the game include:<br/>* A fanblogger, who had his name legally changed to "Admiral Sulu", and Dave, a small time crook, kidnapped the celebrity guest of honor by drugging him and stuffing him in Admiral's van (vanity plates: NTRPRYZ). Unfortunately, during the scuffle, the celebrity guest of honor hit his head on the nightstand. So they took him to a veterinarian they knew and made her patch him up. <br/><br/>* Later on, Admiral and Dave went to get coffee at a diner, leaving the guest of honor drugged in the back. While they're inside, you see the van's engine start to smoke just as the celebrity guest of honor open the back of the van and wander off in a drugged stupor. Dave and Admiral don't notice anything until the van explodes, at which point Admiral freaks out and gets the cops to arrest him by showing them the photos he took on his iPhone of him and the drugged guest of honor.<br/><br/>* The cops release Admiral, having concluded that the photos were PhotoShopped, since they had gotten verification that the guest of honor was at the convention. Admiral raced back to the convention center to find the guest of honor, still dazed and confused, by the largest hentai booth at the convention looking at pornographic fan manga. He was still wearing his housecoat and pajamas from the night before, and had a 7-11 Big Gulp and a corn dog.<br/><br/>Good times.<br/><br/>So here for your Fiasco enjoyment is GenCon: The Worst Four Days In Gaming.

I mean, the locations are taken 100% from real life. The needs are mostly based on stuff I've observed happening at GenCon - except for the crime stuff, natch - though some are exaggerated for effect. The objects are mostly mix of stuff I've seen and stuff that is only slightly exaggerated. For instance, I did see a discreetly placed rack of leather floggers, only it was at the big leather booth, not at a corset booth. And there were life-sized R2D2s, but I don't know if they contained any dead hobos. (Who knows. They might.) Oh, and the signed photo of Felica Day exists. Brennan Taylor told me that he stood in line to get a signed photo for his daughter, so I totally put it in.<br/><br/>Anyway. I have a suspicion that this might be closer to reality than some other playsets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior" title="14thWarrior"><img alt="14thWarrior" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.netflash.net/llanade/BHG_Avatar_Sm.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/14thWarrior">14thWarrior</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293762/#Comment_293762" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T10:04:51+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 10:04AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So my next question... gonna run any Fiasco games with this playset locally? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293777/#Comment_293777" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T11:00:25+00:00" title="September 17, 2010 11:00AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2010 11:23AM by wundergeek.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not immediately, no.

This describes perfectly how I felt every time I went back to our room on the fifteenth floor. I didn't know whether to hug the wall or to walk next to the void so I could hold onto the railing. It was awful! I think it's part of why I figured the yawning void deserved a spot. It's WAY too easy for me to picture people falling to their doom from the twentieth floor.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>Also: this playset makes me very happy.</blockquote>\nYay!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
