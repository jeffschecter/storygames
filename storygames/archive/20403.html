Long time no see.<br/><br/>I've written a new thing. It a speedy horror RPG inspired by Graham Walmsley's <i>Cthulhu Dark</i>. The file includes the rules of the game as well as my first scenario for it.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SQcmcHPP7KdtP0VjY1LvYQIQ7fO83n2o24w8I-pTQz4/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Things Just Ain't Right v0.1</a><br/><br/>If you are so willing, I would like to borrow your eyeballs for a few minutes. I promise it won't take long; the rules and the scenario together take up only fourteen wide-margin pages.<br/><br/>What I'd like you to do is look for any glaring issues. Such as...\n<ul><li>Are the instructions clear? Do you imagine you could sit down and run this thing immediately or would need additional information or clarification on anything?</li><li>Do you see any holes or inconsistencies in the scenario's plot? </li></ul>\nMark Causey has already done a great job being the first-reader on these documents and he helped me fix quite a few issues. However, he and I play together fairly regularly and I want to be sure there aren't any issues that we missed because we're sharing the same assumptions.<br/><br/>If you have any other miscellaneous questions or suggestions concerning the game, feel free to talk about that too. <br/><br/>Thank you for your help. I appreciate your time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449141/#Comment_449141" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T06:17:36+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  6:17AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2015 6:18AM by Paul_T.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Eric!<br/><br/>I only made it through the rules portion for now; I'll have to come back for the scenario.<br/><br/>Comments:<br/><br/>* Almost everything is clear. I don't feel 100% confident about playing just yet, but it seems pretty solid.<br/><br/>* The way healing could potentially double as an advancement mechanism kind of blew my mind a little... very interesting! (I don't even know if you intended it that way, but it's definitely food for thought.)<br/><br/>* I'm not totally sure I understand the idea behind the advantage token. It sounds like you collect them by leaning on your Advantage... but can spend them at any time. Is that right? So, for instance, a character who repeatedly draws on their Stock Muscle Car and banks the tokens, compared to a character who left their Muscle Car in the garage, might be more likely to survive and/or succeed (but mostly survive) in the course of the scenario?<br/><br/>* Characters engaging in supernatural and violent stuff roll more dice. This is cool, because they can get really messed up, it encourages people to look for dangerous and sanity-affecting situations. However, they also have *really* good odds of overall success. Nothing wrong with this per se, but is it appropriate to the intended genre?<br/><br/>I'll be back to read the scenario tomorrow!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449148/#Comment_449148" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T14:00:47+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  2:00PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul. Thanks for the response.<br/><br/>I'm glad to hear that you felt the rules were clear. That's really good to hear.<br/><br/>The advancement possibility of healing is intentional, but unlikely to occur for any given character in any given scenario. Even with liberal use of tokens, a character is unlikely to lose fewer than two points in heath or sanity by the end of the story. The end-of-story reward is really meant to give the players incentive to bring their character into the next story to see just how bad things end up for them.<br/><br/>But! If your character survives and comes out the other end with more health or sanity than they started with? That would be deeply unexpected and therefore completely awesome.<br/><br/>You are correct in your assessment of the token system. Are you more concerned about someone leaning too hard on their advantage (like, using it too often) or are you more concerned about banking those tokens?<br/><br/>As for your final question; I do think the characters' chance for success is appropriate for the genre. If the players are willing to consistently put themselves in harm's way, then they are very likely to succeed at saving the world at the cost of their own lives and sanity. Seems about right to me.<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing your notes on the scenario.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449149/#Comment_449149" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T14:45:38+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  2:45PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was giving it a read and made it about half way through the scenario before I was called away. I found the instructions sufficient to play, but I will need to think on this for a while. <br/><br/>So far the only thing that stood proud to me was this. You wrote: "If the PCs attempt to kill or capture Judy, remind them that she is a monster and they don\u2019t know her weakness yet." <br/><br/>My question is what happens if they do attack her?  After all she is going to attack them using her voice regardless of what they do. Does she have some power or ability beyond her voice? <br/><br/>Of course I'm might have misread this or later in the text this question might be answered and if that is the case please disregard this. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449150/#Comment_449150" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T15:32:56+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  3:32PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 26, 2015 3:34PM by Eric Provost.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi gloomhound, thanks for posting.\n<blockquote>My question is what happens if they do attack her?  After all she is going to attack them using her voice regardless of what they do. Does she have some power or ability beyond her voice? </blockquote>\nJudy has <i>three </i>powers: A deadly voice, eyes of madness, and invulnerability to death, capture, and banishment. All monsters get that third power, just so long as the PCs aren't using the monster's weakness against them.<br/><br/>A lot of different things might happen if a PC attacks Judy, depending on the situation, the intent of the attack, and the outcome of the dice. Judy could get injured. She could be forced to lose her grip on Geoff. The PC could break her jaw, preventing her from talking. They could blind her, cripple her, and generally screw with her plans.<br/><br/>The only things the PCs cannot do are kill or capture her. If you had some means of "banishing" Judy, you wouldn't be able to do that either.<br/><br/> You say you want to cut off her head? As the GM I can choose between saying that this will kill her and therefore automatically fails or I can say that she lives just fine without her head, <i>The Thing</i>-style. <br/><br/>You want to tackle her and tie her up? She uses her voice to shake those ropes loose and runs away while you aren't looking. Or she dodges your tackle, or you accidentally make eye-contact mid-dodge and get hypnotized by the shifting test patterns burnt into her retina.<br/><br/>Personally, I try to go <i>"Yes, and..."</i>-style these days. For example:\n<blockquote>PC: I hit Judy in the head with the fireplace poker.<br/>GM: Remember, she's a monster and you don't know her weakness yet. <br/>PC: That's cool. I'll hit her anyway.<br/>GM: Nice. Judy really doesn't want to get hit by that poker, so make an action test. Since you're totally open to physical harm, make sure to roll the red die.<br/>PC: I succeeded, but took two harm. So... ?<br/>GM: The poker connects with Judy's head, peeling flesh back from her face and sending her reeling... but she keeps her footing. Naturally, she screams from the pain. Describe that two-harm injury for us.<br/>PC: Oh, well if she screamed then it was totally from that. Um... blood flows from my ears, nose and eyes as the sound tears me apart from the inside...</blockquote>\nCool?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound" title="gloomhound"><img alt="gloomhound" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gloomhound">gloomhound</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449151/#Comment_449151" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-26T15:38:49+00:00" title="October 26, 2015  3:38PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good to me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_449163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449163/#Comment_449163" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-27T05:56:24+00:00" title="October 27, 2015  5:56AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric,<br/><br/>Good answers. My "issue" with the tokens isn't a problem, per se - just an odd side effect. Seems kind of funny to me. My instinct would be to make leaning on your specialty a tough choice - do you stick to your specialty, or take the more risky route of doing something you're not familiar with? - whereas here it's a real no-brainer. But maybe I'm just not seeing something!<br/><br/>(Back for scenario later.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
