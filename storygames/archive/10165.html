(Not in the standard UA universe, more's the pity).<br/><br/>I'll be holding it one day a week (which day is To Be Determined) over Google Chat.  I need 4-5 players before I begin.<br/><br/>Create your own characters, with the standard Street Level stats (and without magic.  Yet).  All the PC's are friends from college.  One must be a young-ish woman, and another player, that girl's lover.  <br/><br/>A girl and her lover (player characters) receive threatening letters from her exes... at the same time that bizzare and clearly supernatural things begin to happen.  It <i>cannot </i>be a coincidence, and you must investigate before something terrible and horrifying happens.  And what is the connection between the stalkers, the supernatural attacks, and an artifact called The Mask of Joy?<br/><br/>For more info, post here.  I'll whisper interested parties with my G-mail address.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
