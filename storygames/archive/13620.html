I'd like to ask people to come in costume. I think it likely that we would be more than six; I would have people spread through the appartment, meet in small groups of 3-6 people and tell stories amongst each other, and then mix up the groups in between stories.<br/><br/>Has anyone ever tried this?<br/><br/>Any advice on running this? I never ran a LARP either.<br/><br/>For one thing, should I play as well, or should I have more of a facilitator role? Maybe play the sultan?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307749/#Comment_307749" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-11T00:50:26+00:00" title="January 11, 2011 12:50AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Never tried it.

Rather than... \n<blockquote>have people spread through the appartment, meet in small groups of 3-6 people and tell stories amongst each other, and then mix up the groups in between stories</blockquote>\n... I might keep everyone together, but have them take turn playing characters and being audience. A potential twist here would be to only allow audience members to pull gems out of the Sultan's bowl.<br/><br/>In this manner, GMs would have an incentive to ask players who are close to winning to play characters in their story, ensuring (I hope) that everyone gets to play a character eventually, and simply play audience.<br/><br/>However, it might screw with the economics of the game... Or would it? Perhaps not everyone would get to tell a story, but the game would last just as long as it normally would...<br/><br/>What's the best way to do this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307832/#Comment_307832" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-11T17:06:47+00:00" title="January 11, 2011  5:06PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've wanted to do a LARP version of 1k1N for awhile now.

I'd say, in the situation you describe, a good option would be to go with your initial instinct to ask folks to come in costume, having read the rules and having completed the first part of character creation (name, role at Court, five senses).Since the second half of character creation (envies, ambitions) has to happen in company with other people, plan on having everyone in one room for a bit to finish up, introducing themselves in character and creating envies and ambitions. Then open play with people disbursed through the space to play stories.  Having a couple different rooms with bowls of dice, so smaller groups could play in, say, the kitchen and the bedroom and the dining room, is a fine idea. Then everyone comes back to the living-room for the between-story Court scenes, where the Sultan's will is made known. Someone plays the Sultan and a couple folks play viziers, who's job it is to sit in on the stories in different rooms and report back to the Sultan (who could of course wander where-ever he wanted, whenever he wanted!) with the results of the final rolls. Here's an idea of how it all might look:<br/><br/>Habib, Amia, and Daud have finished their story, watch by Vizier Asan. It turns out Habib has incurred the wrath of the Sultan, Amia is closer to her goal, and Daud is closer to winning his freedom. The Sultan has been listening in on the story told by Sulima, who has incurred his wrath for a second time, Nizam, who is closer to her freedom, and Aba Sadi, who is closer to his goal. When everyone comes back, Vizier Asan presents to the Sultan the error of Habib, the praiseworthy actions of Amia, and the hard work of Daud. The Sultan would then make judgments accordingly, and to the people he was observing as well.  I would do the first Court scenes  over a meal, as a feast before the Sultan. After passing judgment,  the Sultan directs which people go in which groups for the next stories.<br/><br/>The Viziers ought to also have goals and ambitions, and they ought also to be at risk of angering the Sultan, they just have a bit more work to do (as befits their station). Viziers get to declare interests and take part in the stories the same as everyone, they just are the ears of the Sultan, and the people know it.<br/><br/> Get a list of who's playing who before the event, if you can, just to see what you have. This could help tailor your 'set design' for the Palace - if there are some dancing girls, a couple poet/astrologers, some foreign princes, and the cook, that could be a different-feeling court than one that has war veterans, hawk-masters, the sultan's daughter, and the captive knight.<br/><br/>And, yes, you should play as well. You can be the Sultan or not, your choice, but someone ought to be, and you, as host and most familiar with the game, are a natural choice. Since the game is designed to share around the Story Guide role, it's not very GM-heavy, but you will want folks to be familiar with the rules beforehand if possible. If you pitch the game well, and tell them the part about how the stories come from our most familiar childhood nursery rhymes, favorite limericks, and well-known ballads, they will be ok. That and the character creation sheet will go a good way, I think. No-one has to learn a lot of very complex rules to run or play 1001 Nights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307967/#Comment_307967" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-12T20:27:11+00:00" title="January 12, 2011  8:27PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you Meguey, lots of good advice here!\n<blockquote>And, yes, you should play as well.
