The only characters we actually learn anything about in the movie and who have any meaningful motivations at all are Neytiri and, ironically enough, Quaritch. The others are just two-dimensional cardboard - except for Jake - who doesn't even manage two dimensions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269617/#Comment_269617" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-01T10:13:29+00:00" title="May  1, 2010 10:13AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget the embodiment of evil capitalism, that guy had even less of a personality than Jake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269627/#Comment_269627" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-01T13:01:34+00:00" title="May  1, 2010  1:01PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that this could work rather well, actually. Just put a heavy emphasis on hot-shotting goals and rework the anchor thing (maybe take it out entirely?).<br/><br/>I actually kinda liked the corporate guy (as a character, not a person.) The actor did a good job with a pretty bad script: he makes it clear that this guy knows what he's doing is wrong, but if he doesn't do it, the next guy will come along and be even worse. That, plus a sense of entitlement ("we _tried_ the nice way!") makes him feel very accurate to me. A nice view of how an authority figure would work.<br/><br/>Oh, hey! You could totally have multiple authority figures (corporate, military, and scientific) giving you multiple, sometimes conflicting, mission goals. That'd be cool.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
