Background and Initial Discussions<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly some background. We have 6 players, one of whom is completely new to our group, which has been meeting weekly since 2001. None of us had played PTA before, and only I had read the rules. I was confident our group would take to PTA, as Universalis is a favourite.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started by briefly discussing our favourite TV shows, TV characters etc. and I used the discussion to introduce the key concepts of PTA. We agreed that we would seek to avoid a TV series too similar to the games we otherwise play; no criminal/intelligence type investigations or fantasy. A science fiction series was discussed but abandoned as there were very mixed opinions. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe all agreed that historical drama would be fun, providing that we have creative license. Societies of the New World quickly became the focus for candidates: a Native American tribe\xe2\u20ac\u2122s first contact with Europeans, Viking settlers in North America. Then Rome was mentioned and somebody suggested that a prison break involving slaves would be interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Decision<br/>\n<br/>\nWe agreed that an early 1800s Caribbean plantation would be the setting for our series. The series will be a 5 parter (+ pilot). It will have a serial structure leading toward a revolt by the slaves in the final episode. The tone will de defined by massive contrasts (wealth, power, moral), by fear, by brutal violence and by distrust. Our initial feeling of the theme of the show will be \xe2\u20ac\u0153Never abandon hope\xe2\u20ac\x9d. Our show will be called Devil\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Eden. The heat and passion of the Tropics will be a touchstone.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Setting<br/>\n<br/>\nDevil\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Eden is set in the Devereux Plantation, which grows coffee in a coastal valley, on a French island somewhere in the Caribbean. The Devereux Plantation is quite distant from the island\xe2\u20ac\u2122s principal town. It is a large plantation worked by 300 slaves.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Protagonists<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan Hendrix \xe2\u20ac\u201c An English spy posing as a coffee merchant for a London consortium. Mr Hendrix wishes to ferment revolt amongst the slaves on the island and thereby weaken Paris\xe2\u20ac\u2122 grip on this part of the Caribbean.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdges: Agent Provocateur, Charismatic.<br/>\nConnections: Marcus Devereaux (plantation owner)<br/>\nIssue: Unwilling to consider that he can be wrong<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah \xe2\u20ac\u201c A slave recently bought by the Devereuxs. She will be set to work in the Devereux\xe2\u20ac\u2122s house as a chambermaid. <br/>\n<br/>\nEdges: Natural Leader, Beautiful<br/>\nConnections: To be defined (we left this open as Sarah is new to the plantation).<br/>\nIssue: Pride. Sarah was high status before she was captured for the slave trade. The submission required of a slave will not sit well with her pride.<br/>\n<br/>\nGabriel \xe2\u20ac\u201c A slave, Gabriel will flee the plantation during the pilot episode and become a runaway. <br/>\n<br/>\nEdges: Athletic, Good Instincts<br/>\nConnections: Jacqueline Devereux<br/>\nIssue: Forbidden love. Gabriel is in love with Jacqueline Devereux. The extent to which his feelings are reciprocated has yet to be defined. <br/>\nPersonal set: After his escape Gabriel will hide behind a waterfall, a small distance from the plantation.<br/>\n<br/>\nZachariah \xe2\u20ac\u201c A 12 year old slave, younger brother of Gabriel. Zachariah can read.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdges: Small, intelligent <br/>\nConnections: Michael, his father, another slave.<br/>\nIssue: Self doubt. <br/>\nNemesis: Jacques Devereux<br/>\n<br/>\nAbraham \xe2\u20ac\u201c An elderly slave, a widower, well regarded by Marcus Devereux (insofar as he regards a slave) and respected by the other slaves due to his knowledge of Voudoun. Abraham\xe2\u20ac\u2122s duties require him to be in the Devereux\xe2\u20ac\u2122s mansion much of the time. Abraham can read and owns a copy of the Bible.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdges: Trusted by all, Occult Reputation (Voudoun)<br/>\nConnections: Father Christoff, a priest.<br/>\nIssue: A fear of responsibility. Abraham remembers previous slave rebellions and their terrible consequences.<br/>\nNemeisis: O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly, the overseer.<br/>\nPersonal Set: A slave hut, quite distant from the area where most of the slaves live, close to the forest and a beach.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Other Cast Members<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcus Devereux \xe2\u20ac\u201c A rich plantation owner, still Mr Devereux is not as wealthy as he once was. (This has yet to be resolved; gambling or a shipwrecked investment have been raised as causes of his recent financial setback.) Devereux wishes to marry his daughter to a wealthy associate in exchange for a large dowry. He is concerned by the recent fall in coffee prices. Mr Devereux owns a townhouse in the island\xe2\u20ac\u2122s principal town.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenevieve Devereux \xe2\u20ac\u201c Marcus\xe2\u20ac\u2122 wife. She delights in socialising and entertaining, and insists on wearing the latest fashions from Paris. From France originally, she both loves and hates the island. She hopes to return to France but in elevated circumstances, and (somewhat unrealistically) wishes to become ennobled. <br/>\n<br/>\nJacqueline Devereux \xe2\u20ac\u201c Daughter of Marcus and Genevieve. 17, beautiful, something of a tomboy, she enjoys riding her horse and treats her father\xe2\u20ac\u2122s slaves with a measure of dignity. Jacqueline often clashes with her mother. The exact nature of her relationship with the slave Gabriel will be defined during the pilot.<br/>\n<br/>\nJacques Devereux \xe2\u20ac\u201c Son of Marcus and Genevieve. 7 years of age. Crippled by polio, he is wheeled around the house in a wicker wheelchair. He hates Zachariah, a young slave. <br/>\n<br/>\nFr Francois Christoff \xe2\u20ac\u201c A young RC priest. The Devereux plantation falls within his parish. Fr Christoff is assisted by Abraham when he conducts Mass for the slaves.<br/>\n<br/>\nO\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly \xe2\u20ac\u201c Head overseer. He wields his whip with spite and fierce energy. He was born in the County of Clare, in Ireland. O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly is accompanied by his dogs everywhere he goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Closing Comments<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel very good about this game. The setting has immense dramatic potential, there is conflict potential almost every direction I look. I think it will be a challenge trying to restrain the dramatic events in the first few episodes to ensure we have the rebellion during the 4th or 5th episode. <br/>\n<br/>\nNext session, our pilot episode, is in 2 weeks, prior to which we will choose screen presence. I intend to update after the plot. Feel free to post any queries you may have and I would particularly welcome any suggestions for scenes, conflicts, events etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62409/#Comment_62409" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T04:51:43+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  4:51AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that's a set-up rife for drama and conflict.

I'm confident we will do so with sensitivity and an awareness that yes, this is a game, but we will also be making a collective moral statement(s) about an issue which is still very painful for many. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe did have time to discuss language, and which terms would be acceptable, whether we would like to draw boundaries around certain terms of abuse. We decided not to, but to treat the language with respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there will be no harm discussing some other boundary issues before we begin the pilot, particularly in relation to our female protagonist. This is something I'm thinking over and input would be very much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, it's probably worth mentioning that many 17th Century Caribbean slaves were Irish, transported for religious and political reasons, and that our group is based in Dublin. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs regards direction - I think our surrent understanding is that the final episodes feature a mass revolt, and brutal efforts to suppress it. Yes, there will be romance, particularly between Genevieve Devereaux and Gabriel, but that it will probably be doomed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62414/#Comment_62414" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T05:30:00+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  5:30AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope you'll keep us updated as you play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Delirium" title="Delirium"><img alt="Delirium" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Delirium">Delirium</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62418/#Comment_62418" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T06:00:56+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  6:00AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2007 8:04AM by Delirium.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will do!<br/>\n<br/>\nI should also note that I've posted this AP to the RPGnet AP board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Delirium" title="Delirium"><img alt="Delirium" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Delirium">Delirium</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63589/#Comment_63589" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T03:33:13+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  3:33AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2007 3:41AM by Delirium.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pilot Episode<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Preparation<br/>\n<br/>\nI\xe2\u20ac\u2122m usually a high prep GM, which I enjoy. That said, one of the benefits of PTA for me is that I cannot do much prep because scene framing is largely in the hands of the players. I am forced to jettison prep in favour of improvisation during play, which is good because it forces me out of my comfort zone. As such, I was restricted to thinking through the initial scene (the producer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s scene) and brainstorming three or four potential conflicts for each protagonist. Not having ran PTA before I was a little concerned that we might have had an issue with developing meaningful, well designed conflicts, which is why I prepared a list. As it happens, this was not an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Screen Presence<br/>\n<br/>\nWe agreed the following screen presence profile for the protagonists:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGabriel\t2\t1\t1\t2\t3<br/>\nAbraham\t1\t1\t2\t3\t2<br/>\nJonathan\t1\t2\t3\t2\t1<br/>\nZachariah\t2\t3\t1\t1\t2<br/>\nSarah\t3\t2\t2\t1\t1<br/>\n<br/>\nThis took about 20 minutes and also sparked some very interesting thoughts among the players as to the eventual fates of their protagonists. Zachariah\xe2\u20ac\u2122s player stated that he is inclined to have Zachariah die in the last episode, and that perhaps his death could act as a dramatic trigger for the resolution of the love story between Gabriel and Jacqueline.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally we discussed the purpose of the pilot episode, and agreed that it should explore the plantation, introduce each of the protagonists and their respective issues, and act as a proof of concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Producer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Scene \xe2\u20ac\u201c \xe2\u20ac\u0153I am not a cruel man.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus: Plot<br/>\nAgenda: Establish the financial concerns of the Marcus Devereux.<br/>\nLocation: Blesson\xe2\u20ac\u2122s office in the plantation house.<br/>\nPresent: Marcus Devereux, plantation owner, Blesson, Deveruex\xe2\u20ac\u2122s secretary and agent, O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly, Devereux\xe2\u20ac\u2122s overseer, and Abraham, a trusted slave.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs this was the very first scene of the series, I was keen to establish the physical and geographical reality of the Devereux plantation. Shots of the plantation, the house, the slaves returning from the fields and the surrounding jungle vista as the tropical sun began to set were described. The plantation house is a 2 storey affair, bright white, with two wings, shuttered windows and a steep, grey slate roof. House slaves can be seen closing windows and lighting lamps within. <br/>\nWe then focussed on Blesson\xe2\u20ac\u2122s office and its occupants. Marcus Devereux is patriarchal, fatherly. His hair is thinning and and his white waistcoat does little to hide his paunch. O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly, his overseer sits in a chair which can barely contain him. O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly is in his late 40\xe2\u20ac\u2122s, a bull of a man with a wide, red Connemara face and curly grey hair. He is a man alone. Blesson sits comfortably, half spectacles lodged on his nose, his skinny neck emerging from a dark, formal suit. Abraham, the elderly slave stands back, hiding from O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly\xe2\u20ac\u2122s gaze. Abraham is tall, and lean, his eyes are lowered respectfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nDevereux speaks, informing the others that there has been some trouble\xe2\u20ac\u2122at the neighbouring Lecroix plantation. He enquires of Blesson how the coffee harvest is going and is informed that this year\xe2\u20ac\u2122s harvest is not good, and that prices are poor. To further complicate matters, a ship Devereux had invested in has been lost. O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly suggests that, in order to halt any spread of trouble, a severe example be made of any transgressions. Devereux declines this suggestion, for the moment, as he does not wish to punish for punishment\xe2\u20ac\u2122s sake. However, he concedes that stricter measures may be necessary in the future if trouble spreads, \xe2\u20ac\u0153I am not a cruel man, but any rot will have to be cut out.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Instead, Devereux asks Abraham to monitor the slaves and to report any talk or suspicious behaviour.<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict: Abraham\xe2\u20ac\u2122s issue is a fear of responsibility, born of his memories of a prior slave rebellion. Abraham does not wish to act as a spy. He wants no part of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nStakes: If Abraham wins, he manages to assure Devereux that there is no cause for concern and to avoid being asked to make reports. If he loses, Abraham will commit to watching out for trouble and to identify any miscreants.<br/>\n<br/>\nI expended 2 budget, Abraham drew on his trusted trait and 1 fan mail, earned earlier during the scene, so it was Producer 3 vs Abraham 4. Abraham wins and Devereux\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fears are allayed. Abraham states that the 'English' ideas have not spread among the slaves, the slaves listen to Fr Christoff and accept their lot. However, O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly is seething that his suggestion has been overruled while a slave\xe2\u20ac\u2122s word is listened to. Abraham glances at O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly, betraying a hint of satisfaction. This is sure to lead to friction with O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly. The scene ends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Delirium" title="Delirium"><img alt="Delirium" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Delirium">Delirium</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63603/#Comment_63603" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T06:12:21+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  6:12AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4. Abraham\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Scene - Worship<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus: Character<br/>\nAgenda: Hint at Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Love for Jacqueline<br/>\nLocation: The beach, close to Abraham\xe2\u20ac\u2122s isolated slave hut. Early evening.<br/>\nPresent: Abraham, Gabriel, Zachariah, Fr Christoff, many slaves<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scene opens with Fr Christoff holding the Eucharist aloft, chanting in Latin before the slave congregation. Abraham is assisting Fr Christoff. The Mass ends and Fr Christoff leaves. Some time has passed, a fire has been built on the beach. Gabriel and another slave are practising a form of capoeira watched by a large crowd, some of whom are drumming. The camera lingers on the lithe forms of the athletic slaves, spinning, dancing, dodging; kicks arcing in the tropical heat. With each drumbeat, the scene blends, chopping back and forth, to a silent flashback - Gabriel is remembering a recent liaison with Jacqueline Devereux. Jacqueline and he met in the jungle and she taught him how to dance in the European style. We see the beautiful couple together for the first time. The tone is playful, tender, but charged. Gabriel stands on Jacqueline\xe2\u20ac\u2122s foot. She falls over, laughing. He tries to help her up but she pulls him down to the ground. The flashback ends. Gabriel is smiling, he dodges another kick as he notices a rider watching the slaves. Due to the firelight, he cannot make out who the rider is. Is it Jacqueline?  <br/>\n<br/>\nConflict: Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s issue is forbidden love, love between a slave and his owner\xe2\u20ac\u2122s daughter. Do his thoughts distract him from the capoeira bout?<br/>\n<br/>\nStakes: If Gabriel wins the conflict, he wins the capoeira bout and feels that his love for Jacqueline is somehow legitimised. He will be emboldened and inclined to take risks. If he loses, Gabriel will become more cautious, aware of the grave risks he is taking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis conflict, entirely designed by my players, buried any concerns I had that we might have teething difficulties taking to PTA\xe2\u20ac\u2122s conflict system. I spent 2 budget to match the player\xe2\u20ac\u2122s use of Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Instincts trait. Producer wins and wins narration rights! I narrated Gabriel losing focus and taking a blow to the head. He falls to the sand, echoing an earlier fall with Jacqueline. His brother Zachariah notes Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s distraction, as does a house slave named Rachel, who also realises that Gabriel was sorely distracted by the rider and asks herself \xe2\u20ac\u0153Why?\xe2\u20ac\x9d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Delirium" title="Delirium"><img alt="Delirium" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Delirium">Delirium</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64365/#Comment_64365" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T06:43:29+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  6:43AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5. Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Scene \xe2\u20ac\u201c News of England<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus: Character<br/>\nAgenda: To establish the relationship between Gabriel, Zachariah and their father, Michael.<br/>\nLocation: The dormitory hut for unmarried male slaves. Evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nGabriel, Zachariah and Michael, their father, are by their bunks at the quiet end of the hut for unmarried male slaves. Michael is clearly a weakened man. He is listless and very thin. We discussed why this was and decided that a year or so ago, Michael\xe2\u20ac\u2122s wife and the boys\xe2\u20ac\u2122 mother had been ill. Michael had appealed to O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly, the overseer, for help, but O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly had refused. As O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly walked away, Gabriel, enraged, threw a stone at O\xe2\u20ac\u2122Reilly, hitting him in the back of the head. Michael took the blame, and was chained to the weeping pole for three days, before being whipped mercilessly. His wife dies, and Michael lost his hut. Michael blames Gabriel. [We probably should have used a flashback to give this family\xe2\u20ac\u2122s history a narrative treatment but we lost the run of ourselves.] <br/>\n<br/>\nThis end of the hut is a calm contrast to the busy, noisy far end. Michael sits on a straw mattress, his legs hanging over the coarse wood of his bunk. Zachariah asks Gabriel why he lost the fight, what was it that distracted him? Gabriel chooses not to mention the observer on horseback, and explains that he was distracted because of news he has heard, that the English plan to end slavery. Gabriel mentions \xe2\u20ac\u02dcthe House of Commons\xe2\u20ac\u2122. Zachariah becomes suspicious, how does his illiterate brother know of the House of Commons, who has he been talking to? Michael is angry, and tries to shout Gabriel down, as he fears that these rumours will bring nothing but trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nDual conflict:<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict: Does Gabriel overcome his father\xe2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to stifle this foolish talk?<br/>\n<br/>\nStakes: If Gabriel wins the conflict, the other male slaves hear Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s talk of abolition and agree that this might mean their own freedom in the future, despite this being a French island. If he loses, Gabriel is shouted down by his furious father.<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict: Does a suspicious Zachariah link Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s news of England with Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s distraction due to a rider, during the capoeira bout?<br/>\n<br/>\nStakes: If Zachariah wins, he realises that Gabriel is certainly talking to a non-slave in the Devereux household, and the subject of their conversations are clearly very dangerous. If he loses, Zachariah will remain suspicious but will not have linked the rider to Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s news.<br/>\n<br/>\nGabriel wins, Zachariah loses. Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s news spreads like wildfire among the male slaves and they clamour for more details. Michael sits alone on his bed, broken, his pleas for sense ignored. Zachariah leaves, suspicious and very worried. Who is his brother talking to, and why? <br/>\n<br/>\n6. Jonathan\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Scene - Arrivals<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus: Plot<br/>\nAgenda: To describe the differing circumstances of arrival on the island of two protagonists.<br/>\nLocation: The harbour of the island\xe2\u20ac\u2122s principal town.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe scene begins with a series of shots of a small convoy of ships arriving at the island\xe2\u20ac\u2122s capital. A cannon salute welcomes the merchant vessels, who are escorted by a beautiful French frigate; a grand tricolore flies from her stern. One of the merchant vessels is a foul and ugly ship, her dark hold sealed with grating. Her cargo are people. Standing on the deck of one of the merchant vessels is a sharply dressed man, he has a confident and authoritative presence. This is Jonathan Hendrix.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ships dock and begin to unload their many cargoes. A priest goes aboard the slaver and hurriedly performs a blessing over the wrapped corpses of the many slaves who died during the final stages of their journey to this New World. <br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan disembarks and walks through the streets of the town, he throws some copper coins to some children playing in the streets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe shackled slaves are led from the hold, onto the dock and through the streets. Among the slaves is a young woman, who in other circumstances would be regarded as beautiful. She is known as Sarah. On their way to the slave market laughing children pelt the slaves with horse dung.<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan arrives at the office of a commercial agent, to finalise certain formalities and to receive details of his lodgings. He is told that his lodgings are some distance from the town, close to two plantations owned by the Lecroix and the Devereux families. The commercial agent remarks that proximity to the Devereux house may have its advantages; it is known that the Devereux women are beautiful and what man does not like to be amongst beauty? Jonathan is not happy to be lodged so far from town and demands closer lodgings. The commercial agent explains that this will not be possible, and that this is not how such matters are settled on this island. Besides, the frigate\xe2\u20ac\u2122s officers have taken the accommodation in the town. <br/>\n<br/>\nDual conflict:<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict: Jonathan\xe2\u20ac\u2122s issue is that he believes he is infallible. In this scene it is decided that he does not yet understand how a dispute such as this is handled on the island. <br/>\n<br/>\nStakes: If Jonathan wins, he insists on accommodation in town, and the commercial agent will apologise and accede. If he loses, the commercial agent will not budge and Jonathan realises that he must modify how he behaves in such circumstances otherwise he could miscalculate in the future. The social rules are different to those he is familiar with.<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict: Meanwhile, in an inter-cut sub-scene, Sarah is awaiting her turn for auction, from the auction pit we can hear the sounds of men noisily bidding for men. One of the auctioneer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s men orders her to strip. Sarah, in halting French, refuses. Sarah\xe2\u20ac\u2122s issue is her pride and this conflict could set the tone for her entire arc. <br/>\n<br/>\nStakes: If Sarah wins, her calm pride and strength of will overcome the intimidation of the auctioneer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s man. If she loses, he becomes angry and will punish her. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn conflict 1, the producer wins. Jonathan loses, but in doing so he learns a valuable lesson.  He will be domiciled close to the Devereux and Lecroix plantations. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn conflict 2, Sarah wins. She stands proud, with no hint of fear. The auctioneer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s man realises that forcing her to disrobe will be more trouble than it would be worth and, in any event, her beauty is likely to fetch a handsome price. He moves on. Sarah is subsequently purchased as a house slave by Blesson, the secretary of the Devereux plantation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Delirium" title="Delirium"><img alt="Delirium" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Delirium">Delirium</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64366/#Comment_64366" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T06:44:03+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  6:44AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            7. Zachariah\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Scene \xe2\u20ac\u201c Age &amp; Youth<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus: Plot<br/>\nAgenda: To advance the consequences of Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s rumour.<br/>\nLocation: The beach, close to Abraham\xe2\u20ac\u2122s isolated slave hut.<br/>\n<br/>\nZachariah sits alone on the beach, it is midday. He has managed to evade his duties for a short while and is lost in worried thought. We cut to a scene the night before, in which Zachariah came to Abraham, to discuss the rumours and what they might mean. Abraham serves Zachariah some tea in crude, earthenware mugs while Zachariah tells Abraham about the rumours that have begun to circulate. Zachariah warns Abraham that he will not say where the rumours originate, but he must know if they are true, if the English will abolish slavery. Abraham is immediately fearful. He realises what this could mean, if expectations of abolition are raised only to be dashed. Abraham reminds Zachariah that what the English do is of no consequence. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Our masters are French, not English.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Abraham warns Zachariah that some slaves have been killed on the Lecroix plantation precisely because the slaves became dissatisfied with what they have. <br/>\n<br/>\nConflict: Abraham vs Zachariah. [I think the rules state that all conflicts must be between protagonist and the producer, but the players asked that this be a protagonist vs protagonist conflict. As the logic in this circumstance supported such an approach, I happily agreed.]  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Abraham wins, he convinces Zachariah that talk of freedom is too dangerous and will bring the wrath of the French on all of them, man, woman and child. Zachariah will be frightened and will agree to try to dampen these rumours.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Zachariah wins, he begins to believe that emancipation might happen, that Abraham is an old fool who is afraid of change. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbraham wins, decisively, putting the fear of God into Zachariah. These rumours must be stopped! It is agreed that Zachariah is so frightened of the potential consequences of Gabriel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s talk that he might go to the house and report the rumours, in the hope that it is quashed without too much suffering, before events spiral out of control. Zachariah is glad he sought Abraham\xe2\u20ac\u2122s advice. <br/>\n<br/>\n8. Sarah\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Scene - Ascent<br/>\n<br/>\nFocus: Character<br/>\nAgenda: To bring Sarah to the plantation. <br/>\nLocation: The drawing room of the Devereux plantation house.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah, uncomfortable in a white cotton uniform, is being shown her future duties by Rachel, another house slave. To Sarah, the drawing room is alien, filled with bizarre luxury. Rachel, who earlier noticed Daniel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fixation on the rider during the capoeira bout, is taking every opportunity to demean the newcomer. Rachel is a petty and spiteful creature, but not without cunning. They are interrupted by the entrance of Genevieve Devereux, the mistress of the house. Mdm Devereux is a beauty, although jaded and decadent, with a hint of danger that perhaps springs from an unpredictable nature. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Good morning, girls.\xe2\u20ac\x9d She approaches Sarah. \xe2\u20ac\u0153This one is pretty. What is your name, dear?\xe2\u20ac\x9d Mdm Devereux holds Sarah by the chin and gazes into her eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\nConflict: Does Sarah\xe2\u20ac\u2122s pride mar her first meeting with Mdm Devereux? <br/>\n<br/>\nStakes: If Sarah wins, Mdm Devereux is impressed by her calm beauty and decides that Sarah will make a suitable personal chambermaid. If Sarah loses, Mdm Devereux chooses to punish Sarah\xe2\u20ac\u2122s wilful spirit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSarah wins, as the player played both of her edges (Natural Leader, Beautiful) and as producer, I played just 1 budget. I wanted Sarah to win this one, as it would give Rachel a reason to dislike Sarah and would also result in more screen-time for Genevieve Devereux.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenevieve says, \xe2\u20ac\u0153I like this one. Fiery. Some women would not like to have a beauty such as you in their presence, but I think my beauty will be enhanced by yours. Like one of my pretty little necklaces. You will be my new chambermaid. I never rise before 10.00, attend to me tomorrow morning.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Turning to Rachel, she says, \xe2\u20ac\u0153Don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t scowl, Rachel, it makes your eyes look piggy.\xe2\u20ac\x9d Lastly, Genevieve instructs Sarah to inform her if Mr Devereux \xe2\u20ac\u02dcshows an interest\xe2\u20ac\u2122.<br/>\n<br/>\nRachel, obviously, views Sarah\xe2\u20ac\u2122s elevation as outrageous. There is bound to be a reprisal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64372/#Comment_64372" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T07:19:57+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  7:19AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eoin, it might be worth your reposting here your answers to my queries on rpg.net, I think they would interest people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Delirium" title="Delirium"><img alt="Delirium" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Delirium">Delirium</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64463/#Comment_64463" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T14:22:32+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  2:22PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great idea! The following questions, in bold, were asked by Balbinus. Non-bold are my answers. <br/><br/><b>Great stuff, how did the group determine which conflicts were relevant to which scene and how did they set stakes? Did that interrupt the flow?</b><br/><br/>Interesting questions! The conflicts and stake setting emerged far more organically than I had anticipated. I think the players nailed the stakes of the first conflict and this really helped crystallise the method for everyone. I didn't ask my players the extent to which they were planning their own scenes, but I got the distinct impression that everyone had taken a moment to plan out their scene with a conflict in mind, so the conflicts were a part of the flow, rather than an interruption. It might help that of our group, almost all are comfortable with GMing.<br/><br/><b>Also, are players essentially playing their characters or are they also authoring in game elements?</b><br/><br/>Strongly authoring. One or two are really loving the opportunity to work in setpieces - the arrival of the flotilla was described in stunning detail! I'm largely going with the flow, I think I've vetoed just one idea and that was really just a descriptive element (a player initially described Madame Devereux as unattractive, however I wanted to hold on the possibility of tempting Jonathan with a dangerous affair, so after a little debate we went with jaded, seductive decadence).<br/><br/><b>And while I'm here, how do you find it to GM as opposed to other games you GM?</b><br/><br/>Great fun, and something else besides! Games like PTA and Universalis address two roleplaying issues that I totsally dig. Firstly, they are open. I immensely enjoy, and find fascinating, the process by which a group moves from a tabula rasa to the agreed specifics of a PTA series, or a Universalis game. This collective act of birthing a new story, the brainstorming, the give and take, is pure group creativity. And by virtue of the fact that we are selecting certain elements for our story, and rejecting others, we are commenting on what we find interesting and important in all stories.<br/><br/>In terms of GMing scenes, I really like the challenge of having to respond to the priorities and interests of the other players, as the player are framing scenes. And, so far, I have been very pleased that everyone around the table has framed their pilot episode scenes in such a way as to help establish the narrative. It will be very interesting, mid-series, to take a look at the extent to which we remain focussed on the central narrative thrust (toward rebellion).<br/><b><br/>Anyway, very glad you're posting this, I'd have loved to play it.</b><br/><br/>Very welcome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
