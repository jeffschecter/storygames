                    So, there's this wicked game called Bang!<br/><br/>It's a card game, where you play out a spaghetti western shoot-out. <br/><br/>Every player has a character. Each character has a special ability and an amount of hit points (most are 4, a few are 3).<br/>Each player is given a role card. These are Sheriff, Outlaw, Deputy and Renegade. There is only one Sheriff, ever. Although everyone knows who the sheriff is, all the other roles are kept secret.<br/><br/>You play Bang! cards to shoot people. You play miss cards to dodge bullets. You play Panic cards to steal from other players.<br/>There are caravan cards which give you extra draws. There are barrel cards that decrease your odds of getting hit.<br/>There are special cards like Dynamite (basically a Russian Roulette disaster. You light it, and if it doesn't blow up in your face you pass it on.)<br/>There are Indians that descend from the mountains and attack everyone when you play the Indians! card.<br/>There are different guns, and different horses, to put into play.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://files.boardgamegeek.com/bggimages/pic83818.jpg"/><br/><br/>So... I have a game group at school. before some Arts One class, we gather in the Arts One lounge and play games. Usually, we play Jungle Speed. Occassionally we've tried Fargo (a die-gambling game), Mao, and Gin Rummy. I bought Bang! last week, and sent an email out to people telling them to show up extra early for today's class.<br/><br/>We played. And while we were playing, I noticed a few things:<br/>-We all had specialized characters with hit points, weapons and tools, who were making very strategic choices about how to manage resources (cards and alliances).<br/>-A few players were getting "in character". Megan mentioned that "Yeah, the reason I missed is because this corset is too restrictive", pointing at hte illustration of her character, with its tight corset.<br/>-Most of the roles were secret, so people were trying to feel out who was on their side and who wasn't. Similar to citizens trying to establish who is Mafia in... Mafia. It almost felt like the Trust mechanics in tMW, except all done socially.<br/>-When the Dynamite card is played, there is a chance that it'll blow up in the face of the player who played it. Thus, there was a lot of decision making. Do I want to go out with a bang? It feels fitting for the renegade to throw dynamite into the mix, don't it? (It was more than pure statistics, too. People didn't want to play it too early, because the dynamics weren't right for dynamite laying, etc.)<br/><br/>And, I started to feel like this was almost a roleplaying game. If we'd had the opportunity to pick our character and role, it would definitely have passed as a RPG in my eyes.<br/><br/>So... I'm interested in story games. They've never played them, but are interested in Bang! (with its characters and special cards and strategy and such).<br/>I want to introduce them to story games, in a non-pushy, non-hard-sell kind of way. Just, "hey, you might also like this. and then this."<br/><br/>Bang! has a premise (spaghetti western shootout, ripe with hilarity and genre trope), characters (although no character narration), hit points and weapons and armour (and by armour, I mean barrels you hide behind), events (Indians descend from the mountains!).<br/>Where do I go from there?<br/>What game do I suggest?<br/><br/>They like visual elements. Tactile elements. It needs to be playable in 30-40 minutes, with 3-8 players.<br/>We like getting excited and riled up. Jungle Speed is thus a default game. (and not only that, but when it gets down to 5 minutes before class we tend to crank it up to quadruple speed and play while yelling at each other to go faster, and get full of adrenalin.)<br/><br/>Ideas?<br/>Misery Bubblegum feels like it might work, if the rules are still similar to what I played at Camp Nerdly.<br/>Tony, if you are reading this, what's the current state of affairs with that game?                </div>

                            I worry about Capes for several reasons.<br/><br/>First of all, superheroes is pretty geeky.<br/>Second of all, players create conflicts from scratch.<br/><br/>In (the version of) Misery Bubblegum (that I played, at least), internal and external conflicts came on pre-made cards. The conflicts were charged by narration to drop a die onto the card.<br/><br/>It's simple, game-y, the players are in direction opposition, and the premise (high school abusive relationships) isn't an inherently nerdy one*.<br/><br/>Can a Capes session play through in 40 minutes and feel finished?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong, but I think the fact that it's so open-ended makes it kinda intimidating. I am talking about a group of people who've never played any game involving narration; also, a group who only ever plays for the 45 minutes before class.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*Even though, yes, Tony does use it to play Buffy and Space-Robot-Pilots kind of stuff.                        </div>

                            I've only read it, and never played it, but would Dogs in the Vineyard be a good choice since they seem to be down with the old west and it has novel die mechanics?  Maybe someone who has actually played it can chime in with their opinion.                        </div>

How do you consider the Mafia-like aspect of Bang! a failure? Just because it doesn't work as smoothly or well as it could? Because declaring the sheriff doesn't feel like it helps the game much? I'm interested to hear the reason behind this claim (not that I don't agree with it).<br/><br/><br/><br/>Guys, I am going to challenge that idea about Dogs in the Vineyard for a second. Does the game work well with:<br/>1.) Variable amounts of players, often ones who want to "jump into the action"?<br/>2.) 40 minutes of gameplay, before a class?<br/>3.) Potentially fairly large groups? (we're talking 3-8)<br/><br/>The dice mechanics would be simple enough for them, and they like physically seeing the dice, and the premise would be totally cool with them, but I worry about the playability for a fairly informal group. Care to sell me on it further?

That's also a really cool idea. This helps make it even more transitional too. Not only do they not need to create characters, they can use the same ones from the last game we introduced. Slick.                        </div>

                            We frequently play with six or fewer, and the identities of the characters rarely end up mattering.  I have never - never - seen a Sheriff kill a Deputy, and I have only once seen a Renegade win the game.  What this tells me is that the roles' secrecy component, while sort of fun, isn't a core element of play - it breaks down too fast or - in the case of Outlaws and Deputies alike - isn't particularly relevant to begin with.  <br/><br/>Which is not to say that I don't love Bang!, because I do.                        </div>

                            This is a great thread, Joe!  At a previous job, there was a small group of people who liked to game together at lunch, and if the game was cool enough we could rope additional people in to play.  Bang! was quite popular for awhile because it was quick and could support 4-9 people pretty easily.<br/><br/>The Mafia-like aspects were pretty popular with people once they fully understood the ramifications (usually during/after the first game).  I thought the secrecy/backstabbing was a really interesting and simple metagame that fit well over the basic game mechanic.  My experiences were a lot different than Jason, but perhaps that was the large groups we played with or the group dynamics.<br/><br/>But this brings up a much wider question about "gateway" games for non-gamers that I've been thinking about for awhile.  I think the big difference between a more normal card/board game and a story game is that in the former, the elements of the story are already there.  No one is going to ask you, "Ok, Bart.  the Sheriff is having a smoke in front of the bank.  How are you going to get your banditos in there?"  The situations are already setup, usually in a stylized format.  When players add color to a card/board game, it's because it's safe to do so.  You aren't taking so much of a scary creative leap and the color isn't going to make someone "win" or "lose".  I saw the same thing when we would play fast-moving 9-10 person games of Formula De and someone would miss a braking zone and describe their car careening with smoking tires into the turn.<br/><br/>I feel like story games are something different, because in essence you are playing without a net.  There's no board, there are no cards or miniatures to fall back on.  In the end I think a story game so much more rewarding, but it's also an acquired taste.  <br/><br/>There's also the time commitment.  Most people will sit easily for a 30-40 min game, and maybe a 2 hour game if it's really interesting.  But if you think about the dynamics of non-gamers and casual gamers, usually if you are getting together for an evening to "game" you are playing several games.<br/><br/>I would also disagree about Dogs even though I love that game.  The dice mechanics take some getting used to, and the moral choices and subject matter make it not for everyone.  And in a 2-4 hour session you are only creating characters, testing them and maybe getting a few scenes in.<br/><br/>I think this quote was really telling: "They like visual elements. Tactile elements. It needs to be playable in 30-40 minutes, with 3-8 players."  Honestly, the closest I've seen to this so far is 'Once Upon a Time' (storytelling card game), but I just wasn't satisfied with the interruption-based mechanic.<br/><br/>Joe, the game you describe might not exist yet.  But when it gets made, I think we would have a great gateway game.  BTW, I think buffing out a game like Bang! is pretty awesome.  <br/><br/>Chris B.                        </div>

                            Oh god, I typed this huge post out and the window froze. Here we go again.
<blockquote>We frequently play with six or fewer, and the identities of the characters rarely end up mattering. I have never - never - seen a Sheriff kill a Deputy, and I have only once seen a Renegade win the game. What this tells me is that the roles' secrecy component, while sort of fun, isn't a core element of play - it breaks down too fast or - in the case of Outlaws and Deputies alike - isn't particularly relevant to begin with. </blockquote>
Agreed.
<blockquote>Now I want to design a functional, engaging card game that transforms into a full-blown RPG like a Decepticon after a few rounds of play. </blockquote>
I think you should! There need to be more simple, inviting, safe games which bridge into storytelling and narration. I don't have a game I can play with my mother before she cooks dinner. <i>This is a problem, Jason</i>. If I can't think of a single Roleplaying Game to play with my non-gamer, non-geek mother when we have an hour to spend together, then there is obviously a niche not being designed for.
<blockquote>I feel like story games are something different, because in essence you are playing without a net. There's no board, there are no cards or miniatures to fall back on. In the end I think a story game so much more rewarding, but it's also an acquired taste. </blockquote>
I feel like the group I'm talking about would like story games, but I need a way to bring them in where they feel safe and they have a lot of traction. Fairly closed-ended decision making (like escalation in Dogs, conflict cards in Misery Bubblegum), premises that give them enough tropes to play off of (as opposed to premises where they don't have a diving board to go from), tactile elements and small social footprint. That's what the game needs.
<blockquote>I would also disagree about Dogs even though I love that game. The dice mechanics take some getting used to, and the moral choices and subject matter make it not for everyone. And in a 2-4 hour session you are only creating characters, testing them and maybe getting a few scenes in.</blockquote>
I feel like the dice are easy enough for the group I'm talking about (they have done fine with complicated mechanics before so long as they are highly visual), it's more the timeframe that is problematic.                        </div>

                            My game <i>Mexican Standoff</i> is going to be a step up (so to speak) from <i>Bang!</i>, but be warned that it's short. You'll probably play through it in like 15 minutes. It has, roughly, the same-ish situation, but relies more on narration, not card play.<br/><br/>I really thought Clinton's <i>City of Brass</i> would make a good "gateway" or "halfway" type game. It's basically a board-ish game with a really heavy emphasis on narration. What I mean is that players have to narrate everything, but the narration has no barring other than color. Everything progress-related is decided by the dice, narration cannot effect progess. (This makes me want to call it a "not-rpg", but we don't need to get into that right now.)                        </div>

                            For the record, some interactions from today's games (both before and after class):<br/><br/>Alex: But... I shouldn't shoot Nicole again, that'd just be mean.<br/>Nicole; But, I'm not me in this game. I'm Vera Custard.<br/>Alex: Oh, right. Bang!<br/><br/>Megan: I step behind a barrel! *plays a barrel card*<br/><br/>Will: That's right! El Gringo strikes again!<br/><br/><br/>Just, y'know... interesting. Narration is coming out more and more frequently. Just putting character cards in front of them, having wounds to track, having equipment, and with cards that practically have a narrative built in... They move into roleplaying territory almost naturally.<br/><br/>Bang! is officially a gateway game in my books.<br/><br/>With the original set, there is a card called "Indians!" that makes everyone take damage.<br/>With the expansion set, there is a card called "Bible" which effectively acts as a one-time armour (It takes a bullet for you).<br/><br/>Cue lines about preserving moral purity, converting the heathens, and God saving your life yet again.<br/>When one person asked how a bible causes a miss, another replied, "Haven't you ever SEEN a western before?" (ie, they were getting "in genre").<br/><br/>I feel like, after the christmas break, if they still seem potentially into story games, I should introduce Dogs or Mexican Stand-off to them. It'd rock.                        </div>

                            Jason,<br/><br/>I don't mean to. Let me try phrasing it a different way.<br/><br/>Before class, we play games in the lounge. My classmates are now practically addicted to Jungle Speed and Bang! and a few others.<br/>They really like games, and sometimes they even want to play after class is over.<br/><br/>I like games with a storytelling element to them. I get the feeling that they would too, and I've said that before to them. <br/><br/>The issue is one of finding the right transition ground from where we are at right now (Bang!) to roleplaying games. It's not that I want to slowly brainwash them, or be sneaky about pushing it on them... They know I'd love to someday play a game with a strong storytelling element.<br/><br/>I've got a group with a very restricted amount of time, with people arriving at staggered times... Games need to be fast-paced, have tactile elements, and be easy to teach to new players. I feel like with the right game, approached in the right way, they might be really into story-gaming. I'm using this thread as a way of trying to figure out what that "right game, right way" is to show them story-games.<br/><br/>If it turns out that they don't like the game when I try to introduce it, that's cool too. We can play Bang! and Jungle Speed and Mao.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? I want to figure out what games would work, and how their pitches would go, to bring story games to this group.                        </div>

                            Fair enough.  I was just getting a sneakiness vibe, which would be toxic.  Why not ask them to come to your place some evening for a couple hours?  It's the before class circumstances that are limiting here, and you could change that.                        </div>

                            I wonder if a shortened version of The Roach (with a smaller number of hard-hitting scenes) might work well for your group.  It already has cards and you could pregen characters on sheets so you would be ready to roll.  Plus you could get a nice rubber roach to put in the middle of the table:)<br/><br/>I swear, that game is probably the closest I've seen to something that you could simplify (4-8 pages of rules), put in a box with the dice, the roach and everything you need to play and sell at a non-FLGS.  Not that it doesn't stand very very well on it's own thank you, but I think it has that wider potential.<br/><br/>Chris B.                        </div>

                            Thanks Chris!  You're not the only person who feels this way.  It'd take some work on Joe's part but it might be fun.                        </div>
