These were probably the most memorable experiences of the con; the dealer hall was cool, and I saw so many awesome games... but when I go to Gen Con, I want to make sure I play <i>something</i>. I know that there is a lot of evening/night stuff going on in the Embassy Suites, and I assume there will be something like the Games On Demand room from last year. But I'd really like to see if I can make some solid plans with anyone to actually play, and not just hope that something happens. I've found that hoping something happens almost always results in nothing happening.<br/><br/>It doesn't even have to be RPGs (although I'd love to actually try out some of the cooler stuff from the con)... my wife and I love board and card games, too. Maybe we can do a gaming exchange: you show me something cool you like, and I'll show you something cool I like. If you've never had a chance to play Tichu or Intrigue, now's the time to try! <br/><br/>So, does anyone want to get their game on with a stranger and his wife? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210098/#Comment_210098" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T20:13:47+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  8:13PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I take it no one is planning on playing anything at Gen Con?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210099/#Comment_210099" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T20:26:18+00:00" title="June  2, 2009  8:26PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a cornucopia of choice - so many options that it's easier to sort them out at the moment, when I know how busy or tired I might be at a given time. At the same time there's so many less flexible arrangements like booth work that need to be considered that committing to play beforehand doesn't work for me too well. Many things can't be arranged on a whim like play can, which tends to make play the thing I arrange last when it comes to conventions.<br/><br/>So while I do fully intend to play various games at Gencon, at this point I can only express a general willingness to do so when the time comes. Anybody feel free to tug at me on the spot and suggest things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210104/#Comment_210104" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-02T22:34:21+00:00" title="June  2, 2009 10:34PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2009 10:37PM by dyjoots.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait... is Zombie Cinema yours, or am I thinking of a different Eero Tuovinen?
