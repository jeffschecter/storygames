                    Lumpley, I was talking to some other dork about blorby game design and he said something similar to what you said the other day: with a very stripped down rules core very few things have to be salient.<br/><br/>And the game they proposed sounded to my ears similar to a game he wasn’t familiar with—Three Sixteen. Where the amount of enemy aliens that the PCs are fighting is wallpaper and can be improvised but the danger level of the group is salient and is represented by an amount of threat tokens.<br/><br/>And I’m like that’s all within the letter of the blorb principles, it addresses symmetry, but… the awesomeness of the blorb is that it moderates not only symbolic representation (your “dice”), which many games can do… it can also moderate diegetic representation (your “cloud”), which only few games can do.<br/><br/>From B4 The Lost City (good blorby example of what I want)
<blockquote class="Quote">The door to the room, as usual, will swing shut unless held or jammed open. In each corner of the room are small holes that release gas into the room. The gas trap is triggered by opening the door. The gas is odorless, tasteless, and invisible. An elf or thief has a 50% chance to hear the hiss of escaping gas.<br/><br/>The gas will take one round to build up in the closed room before doing any damage. During this round the characters will feel a little dizzy. Each round after the first, the gas does 1 point of damage. When they start taking damage, the party will realize it is getting hard to breathe. Rags or iron spikes jammed into the holes will stop the gas from filling the room. If both the room’s door and the secret door are jammed open, the gas will escape without harming the party.</blockquote>In another game design, this could’ve read<br/><br/>“Gas Trap, DC 12 to detect, DC 18 to disarm, ATK +7 / 4 dmg”. Everything salient is there, the stats, and then the specific location and mechanism for the trap can be improvised wallpaper since the players can’t meaningfully interact with it. In that game, they can <em>only</em> disarm the trap by making that DC 18 roll and they can only detect it by making that DC 12 roll.<br/><br/>So what this is telling me is that a necessary but hitherto underdiscussed component for blorb is:<br/><br/><b>Rules that have diegesis as input, not just symbols as input.</b><br/><br/>(Iow diegetical positioning needs to matter.)<br/>Examples mechanics include finchian trap finding and lawsian talking.<br/><br/> </div>

                            The dork (not Lumps, another dork) replied that I had misunderstood, he wasn't proposing a division along d-exp/s-exp lines but along different arenas in the game. I.e. separate definitions for saliency for "on the job" or "off the job". That does sound like a fruitful ground for game design.

Can I just say that I love this line specifically? The description not only states both mechanically and diegetically what happens, but here it also explicitly creates a <b>link</b> between the mechanical and the diegetic. <i>This is what this specific loss of otherwise-generic hit points from this specific source <span style="text-decoration: underline;">feels like</span>.</i><br/><br/>That's wild. Even as someone who grew up reading things like that, it feels strange and foreign to see it now.                        </div>

                            Agreed. "Rulings not rules" is an acceptance of the limitations of mechanics for every possible situation (a rather obvious fact in most systems, except perhaps for the most abstract); an acceptance of the fact that every case is unique no matter how much it might superficially resemble another, and one of the main reasons I find it so vital for the GM to live within, emulate, and when necessary, extend what I call the "spirit of the system."<br/><br/> </div>

I ask "How do you do that, exactly?" <i>because I use rules where I <b>need</b> to know exactly how they do it in order to adjudicate the rule</i>. If the description is just flavor text, I never remember to ask them.

I could quibble over the globality of rules vs rulings.  Let's just say "a local rule made up on the spot for a circumstance so unique as to confound the RAW, and which contains a multiplicity of fuzzy variable factors."  But further: unlike the general rules found in the RAW, such a rule also needs to cohere to the logic and history of this particular game world and its inhabitants, without breaking the game state in any way, and (for my preference, anyway) in keeping with the "spirit of the system."  In short, it must be more nuanced and fine-grained than a typical rule, and is often a fine-tuned descendant of a rule <i>de jure</i>.<br/><br/>The obvious analogy of a legal decision is not wasted here.  This is why some games literally refer to one of the GM's jobs as "judge."<br/><br/> </div>

                            The sticking point then is to what degree the rulings are precedence-setting.<br/><br/>But I mean what I'm going for here is applying a rule with diegetic input and diegetic output. As an example of such a mechanic: "Write down the name of your character's favorite food". Calling that interaction a "ruling" is a stretch but that's kind of what Finch does on page 2 of primer. I'm not really into that appellation but otoh I'm not really into arguing semantix either.<br/><br/>Any time you're <i>parsing</i> a string (diegetic input) vs just using an interned string (symbolic input).<br/><br/>"I put my hand on the door handle."<br/>"OK you're electrified!"<br/>That's another example of applying a rule with diegetic input. The trap being designed as "Whenever someone touches the door handle…"<br/><br/>(And the trap chapter in XGE was a very frustrating read for me for this reason.)                        </div>

                            Oh boy! 5th edition and traps... yeah.<br/><br/>Another angle on “rulings” I’ve seen a lot:<br/><br/>1. Some people use this phrase to refer to the context of procedural resolution in the game’s engine.<br/><br/>For instance, is the electrocution by door handle determined by a rule (roll Trap Checking against a door handle DC) or a ruling (the referee uses diegetic logic to “rule” when electrocution happens).<br/><br/>In other words, sometimes “rulings not rules” I used to refer to the process of engaging diegetic logic instead of referring to a codified rule. <br/><br/>(I’m not making an argument either way here; just observing how I’ve seen some people use the terms.)<br/><br/>2. When we play the game, do we try hard to resolve everything by established rules, or are we comfortable with handling each situation as unique?<br/><br/>In a lot of “modern” game designs, there is an established framework for resolving things. Some people use “rulings not rules” to refer to a style of play where we feel comfortable treating an electrified doorknob differently from<br/>a poisoned punch bowl, whereas some rulesets<br/>would insist that “a trap is a trap” and “all traps are resolved through [specified mechanical procedure]”.<br/><br/>I’m with you, Sandra, that “finchian trap finding” can be seen as a  resolution method governed by rules, not everyone sees it that way.                         </div>
