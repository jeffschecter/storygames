Burning Wheel has been one of my top contenders for when ever I do get around to playing it (that or Heroquest). It's a good fit and would definitely make a more grounded real world Sigil, which I dig, kinda like New Corzuban or something. <br/><br/>I think the game works as is and you can always add stuff on top of the basic game using the Monster or Magic Burners. One thing I have been toying with would be something similar to Faith for each of the Factions so they could work belief based miracles. I would prob also create a few Die Traits to cover the other cool Planescape bits as needed, like the Dustmen Pact for example. <br/><br/>If you run this, definitely come back and tell us about it!<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196319/#Comment_196319" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-09T15:39:55+00:00" title="March  9, 2009  3:39PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2009 3:55PM by akooser.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya Hansel,<br/><br/>  I'd hit up the posts on the BW wiki about first time play. If your whole group is new to BW then I would recommend reading pgs. 1 -77 of the main book (up to where it says play now) and then run the <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloads#The_Sword" rel="nofollow">Sword</a> for your group. Just stick with the rules on pgs 1-77. This way you have throw away characters and people can try out the system to see if they like it. <br/><br/>   There is loads of advice on the wiki for first timers. Once you figure out if BW will work for you and your group then proceed forward with the PS thingy.<br/><br/>This is stolen from a poster over on the BW forums but it can help draw in your players. These questions need to be answered as a group before your PS game begins.<br/><br/>"What's the Big Picture? What's going on in this setting that makes it ripe for adventure. What's changing, evolving, declining?<br/><br/>What's the world's culture? What are the cultural analogs? Analogs can be taken from historical earth, current events or fantasy works.<br/><br/>What's the conflict in which the characters are involved? What are the sides? What's wrong?<br/><br/>What physical place does this conflict take place in? What ecology, environment, place? <br/><br/>What's the name of the most important place in this setting? Not the capital or any dumb shit like that, but THE PLACE where all the action goes down?<br/><br/>What's the name of a faraway place that folks talk about, dream about or mutter under their breath about?<br/><br/>Who are the antagonists? Who is opposing the goals of the characters? <br/><br/>Imagine all of the characters are standing a room/ruin/field with the antagonists or their minions. What do the antagonists want from that meeting? What do the characters want from that meeting?<br/><br/>What type of magic exists in this world? <br/><br/>What character stocks are in play in this world? Which are restricted and why?<br/><br/>What cultural traits apply to the characters of this game world? Pick three character traits for each culture.<br/><br/>What's your Resources cycle? 1 month, seasonal, 6 months, annual? What's the game world's currency? Who collects the taxes? What do people do for work? What's the major economy? <br/><br/>Material world: What weapons and armor are available? Are some weapons and armor restricted to certain cultures or character stocks?

Maybe you can alter reality based on the character's beliefs somehow by sending an extraordinary amount of Artha, like a setting mini-epiphany.<br/><br/>I wouldn't bother creating lifepaths or any of that nonsense; I don't think it is necessary.

Thats a good point. A few more, of the top of my head:<br/><br/>Because it's reward-based, players aren't <i>forced</i> to do anything, just encouraged. So, ignoring the story possibilities set up by the specific Outer Plane gets you nothing. Fighting against it (struggling against that belief) gets you rewarded, and conforming to the Plane gets you rewarded even more.<br/><br/><br/>If you rewrite a belief to match the Plane's belief, of course you get rewarded with double Artha - one for each Belief, even though they are the same. I guess you could almost get the same effect if you rewrite your beliefs to be the exact opposite of the Plane's, then you get rewarded for pushing yours and struggling against the planes, but it won't be an even 1:1 ratio every time.<br/><br/>There are also traits in Burning Empires and later products (Blossoms, Magic Burner IIRC), that give Artha awards for specific behaviors. Something else to draw some inspiration from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197013/#Comment_197013" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T11:10:41+00:00" title="March 15, 2009 11:10AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hansel,<br/><br/>   You might check out your area to see if there are other BW players so you can go for a meet-up.
