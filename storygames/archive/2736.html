Most of my previous relationship maps have not been detailed enough to really get any kind of topological information from, but this one is pretty exciting. It led me to thinking about topological and geometric relationships and how they can be described in a relationship map in a way that can be interesting.  Perhaps even mathematically rigorous eventually, if I get some time to waste.<br/><br/>Because I handle a lot of my games like episodic TV or comic books, I thought about a show that's highly about relationships and had an unusual r-map that illustrated something that I liked and provokes a lot of interest: discontinuity in Lost's relationship map.<br/><br/>Now as you may or may not know, Lost is about a group of passengers on board an airline flight that crashes on a mysterious island. Each episode has both a character's flashbacks and progresses the plot on the island.<br/><br/>This means that the r-map has the central characters all bound up in the web of life on the island with each other, and the flashbacks are largely 'islands' of their own, attached to the main web only by the character whose flashback it is.<br/><br/>However, starting late in the first season, and highly ramped up during the second and third, audience members could see that the 'flashback islands' were themselves sometimes connected, and let me tell you, these discontinuities in the normal isolated flashback character relationship schema provoked a great deal of interest.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gliffy.com/publish/1200459/" rel="nofollow">Check it out</a>.  I've highlighted an 'anomalous' connection in red.<br/><br/>What these connections are is like the punchline of a joke - they're unexpected, they don't fit with what you've been told so far. Like a punchline, they attract attention disproportionate to their "objective" importance (for example, the anomalous connection I've listed is really just about a fellow, Randy, who's a terrible manager and ends up being a terrible manager everywhere he goes, not any kind of earth-shattering relationship or plot advancement.)<br/><br/>What does that tell you? Well, in order for there to be a sizable discontinuity, you need to have two things:<br/><br/>First, you need a network of sufficient complexity that you can have <i>continuity</i>, in other words, a pattern that the mind can perceive deviations from.  So for example, if you have a very small number of characters and they all have connections to each other, that's a pattern, but if you have a small number of characters and they have connections to some, but not all, it's possible that an observer would just say "meh, it's random" and not really attach much significance to any particular deviation from a rule.<br/><br/>Second, you need an outlier that is connected in a sufficiently different from the rest of the network that the mind can recognize it as breaking the pattern.  In other words, if you have 50 characters, all with 3 connections to each other, and 1 character with 4, that's not sufficiently different to attract much interest. By contrast, if you have 50 characters with 3 connections to each other and 1 character connected to <i>all 49 of the other characters</i> then people will get really interested - why is this dude turning up so much, what is his deal, how come he seems to be around every corner?<br/><br/>Thinking back to my old relationship-map days when White Wolf was doing them (not virtuously like we do them today, of course, but still), they typically had a small number of people or organizations on the map, but a high degree of interconnectivity.  In order to make a discontinuity on that map you would have to have someone who is really only connected to one person or organization - then the interest would come from "why is this guy not involved in what everyone else is involved in, what's his story".<br/><br/>In my Tenebrous game, you'll find that there's not a lot of interconnectivity between organizations outside of the context of specific missions. When I do introduce a character who recurs, it will make them that much more interesting <i>because</i> the rest of the world is busy in their cubicles.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62509/#Comment_62509" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-29T18:22:32+00:00" title="March 29, 2007  6:22PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2007 6:23PM by Sempiternity.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting!<br/><br/>Do you think such an anomalus relationship, given that this is a deliberate story-game, would be more or less effective if its statistcal significance is hovering near "random"?

So the attention/excitement is typically going to be on whoever the freak is, then: if you're following the conservation of NPC theory in a game, then the one who will generate the most interest will be the one who <i>isn't</i> one of the highly-conserved NPCs.  If your game is mostly separate, isolated, NPCs to emphasize how big and impersonal the world is, then the NPC who will strike the strongest chord is the one who's the most highly-conserved.<br/><br/>Interesting idea, and maybe even plausible, but I'll believe it works when I see it working.
