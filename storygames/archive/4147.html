The stuff that's seekrit is this:<br/><br/>Forum Discussion: It's stuff related to the inner workings of the forum (like outages, fixes, questions on how to use the code, etc). I didn't see any reason to air dirty laundry.<br/><br/>The Sandbox: The same reasons.<br/><br/>Little Ideas: These are where you dump your "I'd love to use this someday, but for now I'll share it with y'all" ideas. At first, I kept this hidden, y'know, like as a community feature. If you're "in", you can see cool little ideas that others had, and share your own. And they won't get "stolen" or misjudged by other folks. Nowadays, I think the "Stolen" bit is silly, and yet I still wanted to have a Benefits of Membership thing going on, so Little Ideas remains the main Seekrit Area.<br/><br/>Links to Gaming Discussion: It's for the community to talk about the latest buzz, link to other articles, books, blog posts, and give a running commentary. I had a really good reason for keeping this a member's only area, which honestly I have completely forgotten. I might have to check the archives from last year to see if I could remember that train of thought. Nowadays, I think the "Monthly Gaming Discussion" is a cool draw to these forums (original idea totally stolen from Judd, IIRC, who used to do it weekly), and maybe I intended to keep it private ala "Benefits of Membership".<br/><br/>Game Design Help: This I'm keeping hidden for two reasons:<br/>MAIN: I want people to not see this area until they join. Story Games is not a Game Production Powerhouse, it is an RPGNet for small press games, new play styles, and related discussion. For people who are already talking about that sort of thing, Game Design Help presents and area for other members/participants of this site to ask others for help or ideas. I don't want people to join only for the ability to get community design feedback. I want people to contribute a little here before they start asking for feedback.<br/>SUB: To keep folks' ideas private. Some people like to design on their blogs and stuff. Others might be a little more shy or trepidatious about sharing their ideas or requesting feedback in public. So it's a non-judgmental community only thing.<br/><br/>The main cool stuff you get for joining, though, is under your accounts panel. Jump on in there and check out the various Stylesheets. I HIGHLY recommend "Jazzman". I might even eventually make that style the forum default. <br/><br/>Also, if you click on the Categories page, you can choose to NOT see discussions on a particular topic.  Don't want to see people pimp their shit? Then go and click on Hide Discussions from the "Directed Promotion" category. Or if you are tired of everyone's "Game Design Help" threads, you can click on that button on the Categories page and they disappear.<br/><br/>Trick your shit out.

I was of two minds on this one.  I didn't want people to join this site SIMPLY to plug their own shit to the world (that is, posting a link here hoping to attract the eyes of lurkers) before contributing to the site. I mind it less if people join the site, see Directed Promotion, and plug their gaming stuff to the community who might be interested in it. <br/><br/>And I mind it <b>not at all</b> if people plug their shit, in public or private, if they've posted here or there, contributed a little to the site. Not talking 50, 100, 200, or 500 posts.  Just SOMETHING more than "Here's a link to my New Thing!" and that's it, period.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93028/#Comment_93028" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T16:22:31+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  4:22PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93067/#Comment_93067" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T19:53:55+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  7:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gah, the Jazzman text is SO BIG.
