They had a pre-supposed idea of "first the PCs do this, then they do that, then they do this".<br/><br/>They were pretty salvagable compared to what later became the standard adventure format. But. They were among the first (not the very first) modules made this way.<br/><br/>Before, modules were a place that you explored.<br/>Room A has this, room B has that, room C has this.<br/><br/>After, it was a sequence of events.<br/>First they go to Cairo and they see this clue. Then they go to Madrid and they see this clue. Then they go to Moscow and fight the boss.<br/><br/>Again, not every module in the DragonLance series was this way. And, a lot of people have conflated the linearness of the novels with the linearness of the modules.<br/><br/>Still, when we talk about DragonLance-style adventure, what we mean \u2014 fairly or unfairly \u2014 is an adventure that has events arranged in a sequence, rather than spatially.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473738/#Comment_473738" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T19:09:10+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  7:09PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, thanks!<br/><br/>Yeah, I never ran any modules (not out of some egalitarian bent, just couldn't afford it, lol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473739/#Comment_473739" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-10T19:12:04+00:00" title="May 10, 2018  7:12PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://grognardia.blogspot.se/2008/04/how-dragonlance-ruined-everything.html" rel="nofollow">A lot of my thinking on Dragonlance is just me parroting Grognardia</a>.

I think that this blind spot exists for rather many of us younger gamers who didn't live through the '80s changes in the creative nature of the hobby. The old style got so well buried that the hobby nowadays is full of people who simply cannot conceive of how little they know about one type of tabletop roleplaying - it's like thinking that you're good at music, except you don't even know that classical music exists. The fact that the very terminology of the hobby has been repurposed doesn't help things - you can think that you know what "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" is, all without knowing that a rather different game used to be played under that title. The OSR people have had to essentially invent a new parallel terminology ("old school" and all that) just to be able to talk about the older era distinctively.<br/><br/>Once you know that you don't know, like Socrates, you might have a shot at educating yourself a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473917/#Comment_473917" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-14T16:52:55+00:00" title="May 14, 2018  4:52PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D modules tended to be site based.

I know that had I gotten the idea of reading the Keep on the Borderlands (why would I?), I could have gotten on top of this stuff a decade earlier than I did - it's really a quite good text in its context, I found it very easy to understand what it is trying to do, and why.<br/><br/>Fill in the holes with ancillary reading, whatever you need - iterations of the Basic texts, AD&amp;D 1st edition, third-party supplements, more adventure modules, magazine stuff from the era, memoirs of the people who were gaming then, OSR historical revisionism, Grognardia-style historical analysis...<br/><br/>In fact, you could just skip all those primary sources and read Grognardia if you're just interested in the OSR "standard interpretation" of it all.

I was 10 years old at the time. Accordingly, the Dragonlance novels shaped my interpretation of what D&amp;D was supposed to be about. This was also the 2nd Edition era, and--if memory serves--the game texts largely reinforced the idea that D&amp;D was about heroes going on epic quests to save the world. Or at least, they didn't disabuse me of the idea. ALL of the campaigns I DMed from age 10 through university were, in one way or another, predicated on the Dragonlance model.<br/><br/>Interestingly, a year or two after I started playing (let's say age 12) I had the opportunity to play in a campaign DMed by my friend's uncle, using <i>B2 Keep on the Borderlands</i> and 1st Edition rules. I remember writing a two-page Code of Chivalry for my Paladin character (as recommended in the 2E <i>Complete Paladin's Handbook</i>, only to have him killed by a stirge on his first foray into the swamp the party was exploring. Needless to say, it was a bit of a play-culture shock. Despite the frustration of frequent character death, I enjoyed playing in this campaign for a couple of years.<br/><br/>I discovered the OSR around the time that 4th Edition D&amp;D came out, as I was looking for alternatives. At that time, I ran a campaign based on the aforementioned <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i> and using the 1983 Basic rules. Aside from any potential nostalgia, it was only by <i>playing</i> the older style of game again that I really came to understand its appeal, as well as how truly different it was from the kind of D&amp;D I had (mostly) played up until that point in my life.<br/><br/>Eero is spot on in recommending B2.

Alongside Marvel it's one of the two things I allow myself to feel like an expert about.<br/><br/>I'm often confronted by people about how the Dragonlance modules were a railroad, when there was a considerable amount of exploration and freedom of play in them. Even in the first module, Dragons of Despair, the quest is clearly laid out in front of the players, and there's a huge army approaching, so those exist as constraints. But the immediate setting around the town of Solace is fairly extensive; there are other settlements to visit, places to explore, options for which way to go. Ultimately you're supposed to go to the swamp where the great sunken city of Xak Tsaroth can be found, but once you're there it's a standard D&amp;D dungeon. Sure there's a big dragon in it, and it comes out early on to take a swipe at your party and retreat to its lair, but I don't see much difference between this scenario and, say, the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (which similarly has a wilderness trek constrained by events to a big underground dungeon) or any of a number of other modules of the pre-DL classic era.<br/><br/>Dragonlance made use of the idea of using certain timed or sequential events, which was a way to plan out encounters separately from the dungeon map. That was a neat innovation, but hardly new to DL - older modules had similar concepts. And the amazing art and isometric maps had already been tried out with modules like Rahasia for Basic D&amp;D and the Desert of Desolation modules (which were Tracy &amp; Laura's first forays into module writing, and presaged a lot of what would end up being common practice for DL and onward).<br/><br/>Dragonlance also had pregenerated characters with names and identities, but, just like everything else, this wasn't new. The are pregenerated characters in a lot of older modules, though none with as much attention to back story and plot. But if you didn't know any differently, you'd have no less trouble choosing one of the Heroes of the Lance as you did grabbing one of the pregens from Tsojcanth: Cathartic (Female Human Cleric 7), or Ethelrede (Male Human Fighter 8), or Arocken (Female Human Ranger 6), or Weslocke (Male Elf Fighter 4/Magic-User 9).<br/><br/>My point I guess is that the gloss and attention to draw people in with attractive art and maps, a compelling new setting and story, and a focus on the things the game was supposed to be about (dungeons and dragons) might have created a turning point for module publishing at TSR, but there's nothing in the DL modules that strikes such a renaissance in the game that wasn't immediately altered or overshadowed by the release some years later of 2nd edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473976/#Comment_473976" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-15T22:16:58+00:00" title="May 15, 2018 10:16PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was out of gaming for the entire time Dragonlance was the big thing in D&amp;D and have only the foggiest idea of what it was all about.

They are well worth a read, very interesting as works of the craft - it is very obvious in them how much care and concern went into designing and writing them, in a way that's not always evident in TSR products. One of the items on my personal bucket list is to get to play the Dragonlance modules at some point with a patient and dedicated crew.<br/><br/>In my judgement they are at the radically experimental edge of what would be normal for a '70s D&amp;D adventure module, bold in what they demand and expect of a D&amp;D group. They are definitely a transitional product, rather than a fully formed example of the railroad-plot culture, but I think it'd be misleading to insist that they aren't radical. They were not the first, but Dragonlance was easily the popular break-through product for a new, fresh way of roleplaying that is fundamentally at odds with the likes of the <i>Keep on the Borderlands</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474013/#Comment_474013" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T13:48:54+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  1:48PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really recommend the novels, unless you're interested in them from a "historical study" point of view.

Serial fodder, essentially. Not so absolutely awful that you couldn't appreciate anything in them, but entirely unremarkable in the wider context of world literature.<br/><br/>Of course I, like many others in my age group, got Raistlined so hard as teenagers that you can't really expect us to be objective about it. I have much more emotional baggage about Dragonlance (and consequence ability to enjoy it, even if it is a rather self-aware enjoyment) than the quality of the novels justifies.<br/><br/>I wouldn't want anybody to get the impression that our collective enchantment with Dragonlance is due to some perennial literary quality. It's just like He-Man and such, the nostalgia factor is what makes Dragonlance useful for those of us who got exposed as kids. If you need to pick up a gaming fantasy myth cycle for some reason or other anyway - to game with, for instance - then why not pick something like Dragonlance where the nostalgia factor will at least keep <i>you</i> entertained...<br/><br/>The adventure modules, though: this judgment does not apply to them. These are different artistic mediums, and the fact that the literary elements are merely mediocre takes nothing away from the ambition of the gaming vision. I would even argue that being any more ambitious as literature would actively take away from Dragonlance as adventure modules - they are already very radical as is in what they expect the players to accomplish and experience, anything more would be straight out wishful thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474020/#Comment_474020" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T17:51:24+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  5:51PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read the Dragonlance novels before I read any fantasy, so I thought they were the shit.

Rereading the book having this hybrid model in mind, I instead realize that the event is meant as a collection of resources to use when setting up scenes one at a time in this way. \u201cLet\u2019s do a scene on the landing deck. The question is: where do the heroes want go from here, and can they do so? I\u2019ll add in Electro etc etc\u201d</p><p>This hybrid model where scenes are framed aggressively, as if it were a story game, but then played out mechanically, I think Fate and MHR is built on it but it took me a long time to wrap my head around. Arguably the intro adventure in Feng Shui (the old one) is similar. The games are intended to be action games and once the \u201cplaying pieces\u201d are in place, the fun starts. With less consideration put on what goes on between these action scenes. You use the outcome of one to get ideas for setting up the next, together with ideas from the module. A set piece model.</p><p>Compared to something like Barrowmaze where our PCs were putting up trip wires and glue for skeletons, the interaction wasn\u2019t contained in atomic units.</p><p>To bring it all together, the \u201cPortes\u201d in those games aren\u2019t arranged in an player-explorable structure, there can\u2019t be the \u201cpush\u201d-model of players visiting nodes in the order they want. And the \u201cMonstres\u201d are packed in together with the \u201cPortes\u201d into framed \u201cScenes\u201d instead of being decouplabe / \u201cwandering\u201d. (Ofc they are reusable for future scenes as long as they are alive.)</p><p>In a game like MHR or Fate, you have lots of agency within the scene, with plenty of meaningful micro-choices to affect your outcomes (\u201cdo I activate my limit right now?\u201d etc etc). But in a game with a P-M-T structure you also have agency with the structure as a whole, not just in invididual scenes. And arguably that\u2019s more appealing to me. I dunno maybe I still have a lot to learn about the Framed-Scene model. I just love D&amp;D so much T_T</p><p>In the Framed-Scene model, it\u2019s arguably a good thing to follow the suggestion in \u201cBreakout\u201d where it says \u201cit\u2019s best if a non-flying hero witness [name elided b/c spoilers] departure\u201d. That\u2019s what creates the most interesting next scene. In the P-M-T model it\u2019s instead just\u2026 what happens happens. If a monster flies away, then whoever sees it sees it. That\u2019s just how it is. Arguably more agential for exploration-based play.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474444/#Comment_474444" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-04T17:43:06+00:00" title="June  4, 2018  5:43PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even for an exploration game, you don't need (one) GM.
