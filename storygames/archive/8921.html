We stopped numerous times during the game to talk about what was going on, so I feel like our group is getting on the same page, but I still want to parse some thoughts and see what you all think.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with the session was that the GM wasn't following, what to me, is Rule <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> in Dogs: Say yes, or roll the dice.<br/><br/>He's had years and years of experience GMing trad games, and this is his first indie game. I felt like I, as a player, had no control over what was going on in the game. He would look at my character sheet and see "I am a student of nature 2d6" and then say, "you notice that the Brother who appears to be dead at your feet was in fact poisoned by dragonroot, a rare herb that you know is used as a poison by the Mountain People." I had such a visceral reaction to him doing this that I was surprised at myself. It was like I was making a Knowledge--Nature check in D&amp;D but he did everything for me. It was unbelievably frustrating. I also probably could've been more proactive about grabbing the reigns in some ways, so part of the problem lies with me, I realize.<br/><br/>Moving on, here's a real question: <i>how</i>, exactly, is DitV supposed to be played? We were running around town most of the game talking to people and trying to solve the mystery of what was going on. In a 5 hour game we had 3 conflicts (not each, <i>total</i>), and we're still not done with that town and don't really know what's up with it. We, the players, were having trouble setting up conflicts and establishing stakes, and the GM gave off the sense that he had ideas of how to do this, but wanted us to figure it out. It felt like pixel bitching. I was very turned off by the investigation aspect--I really don't like this kind of thing in D&amp;D and CoC, and I didn't like it here. Is this the way DitV is supposed to be played, and it's just not the game for me? How much investigation and mystery-solving is it supposed to contain? I've read the book (but not the GM/Town-creation section), and I was so excited because it seemed to be all about conflict and narrative sharing, but that's not how it felt in play.<br/><br/>Does this match up at all with your experience of Dogs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196985/#Comment_196985" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T04:05:39+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  4:05AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First things first: people from the town should come to the Dogs, *eager* to tell them what's wrong (in their opinion). If there are two "factions", representatives of *both* factions should do so. And each will think they are right, and that the Dogs will decide in their favour.<br/><br/>And in the best towns the Dogs will listen to all of them, will have all the details (there, investigation done), and still will have no clear "these people are wrongdoers, and those are victims, deal" path. They'll have to *choose*.<br/><br/>Strictly speaking, there is no investigation in DitV. <br/><br/>Read the manual, the section that tells the GM how to play the city. If your GM has a long experience as a trad gm chances are he took it all as a suggestion, and maybe he did not even use the town creation rules. That is generally what breaks a Dogs game: the gm rules are *rules* nonetheless, and the GM should follow them. (I don't have page references 'cause I have the game in Italian, sorry)<br/><br/>DitV is a game about difficult choices, not investigation. The sooner you know all the details about what you should be deciding on, the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196993/#Comment_196993" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T06:09:13+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  6:09AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "trying to solve the mystery of what was going on" - DitV does not support this genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke" title="NoahTheDuke"><img alt="NoahTheDuke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke">NoahTheDuke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197001/#Comment_197001" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T08:45:48+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  8:45AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Page 138-139: "Actively Reveal The Town In Play: <br/>  The Town you've made has secrets.

Instead, you have cool things -- bloody, sexy, murderous damned things -- that you can't wait to share.<br/>  There's this interesting hump I have to get over every time I GM Dogs -- maybe it'll go away eventually. It goes like this:<br/>  The PCs arrive in town. I have someone meet them. They ask how things are going. The person says that, well,  things are going okay, mostly. The PCs say, "mostly?"<br/>  And I'm like "uh oh. They're going to figure out what's wrong with the town! Better stonewall. Poker face: on!" And then I'm like "wait a sec.

In fact, I want to <i>show</i> them what's wrong! otherwise they'll wander around waiting for me to drop a clue, I'll have my dumb poker face on, and we'll be bored stupid the whole evening."<br/>  So instead of having the NPC say "oh no, I meant that things are going just fine, and I shut up now," I have the NPC launch into his or her tirade. "Things are awful! This person's sleeping with this other person not with me, they murdered the schoolteacher, blood pours down the meeting house walls every night!"<br/>  ...Or sometimes, the NPC wants to lie, instead. That's okay! I have the NPC lie. You've watched movies. You always can tell when you've watching a movie who's lying and who's telling the truth. And wouldn't you know it, most the time the players are looking at me with skeptical looks, and I give them a little sly nod that's yep, she's lying. And they get these great, mean, tooth-showing grins -- because when someone lies to them, ho boy does it not work out.<br/>  Then the game <i>goes</i> somewhere."<br/><br/>I think that's where your GM is having a bit of trouble.

I think the big problem is that he's playing in another Dogs game, and they're doing things completely the wrong way, so that's transferred over to him doing that in our game. I've pointed out to him (politely) numerous times that "hey, I <i>think</i> this rule actually works this way, read this page in the book and tell me what you think." And he says, "Oh man, we've been doing it way wrong in my other game." I'll email the group the "Actively Reveal the Town in Play" thing. We've also talked about me switching with him to be the GM, since I get it and don't have the lens of a lot of trad experience to view things through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197018/#Comment_197018" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T12:33:00+00:00" title="March 15, 2009 12:33PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Inexperienced players often make for surprisingly good Dogs GMs. Let me tell you a story... Dogs was published in Italy by Michele and Claudia (from Narrattiva, both active here on s-g from time to time). Michele had many years of trad GMing on his shoulders, while Claudia only ever played. When they tried Dogs in the Vineyard they convinced Claudia to give it a shot to GM, since the game seemed lighter to manage, and had clear rules about what to do.<br/><br/>Well, they discovered that Claudia was a killer Dogs GM, to her own amazement. Michele had years and years of habits that went in the wrong direction for a Dogs game, Claudia didn't. He even went on to write, some time later, a very insightful list of "things I struggled when learning this newfangled games" regarding Dogs, just to show people with a ling experience they are not alone: it's surprising, but you really *have* to learn these games, each with its own way, and experience often not only does not help, but hinders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197022/#Comment_197022" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T13:58:40+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  1:58PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2009 1:59PM by Hans_c-o.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two more things that happened in the game that I need help with: please read these and tell me if we're doing something wrong, because I feel like there was something wrong in these situations, but I'm not sure what it was.<br/><br/>1. We, the PCs, are in town, and we're told by the Steward in the middle of the night that another Dog has just ridden into town, and he's dying. We run around a bit and find out he's been poisoned, and we're stone-cold convinced that the town doctor did it, so we go to him, force open his door, and accuse him of poisoning the Brother. We roll dice and I establish the stake, "The doctor admits to poisoning our Brother in the Faith." We have a conflict and the Dogs win, I narrate how the doctor admits it and says he's been blackmailed into it, etc. Is there anything fishy in all this? Perhaps I was asking for too much in the stakes?<br/><br/>2. Multiple Opponent Conflicts. I've read this chapter in the book, but it doesn't help with my question. Myself and the other player just kept having two-on-one conflicts, which were easy to win. In the previous example, both of us were present when I broke down the door and accused him, and it would seem strange if the other Dog just stood by and did nothing, so we both rolled dice and had a two-on-one conflict. Two out of the three conflicts we had were like this. Should we be using the helping rules as opposed to always having Two-Dogs-on-one conflicts?<br/><br/>Thanks, seriously, this thread is clearing up a lot of things for me. Man, it seems like there's nothing more complicated than playing a role-playing game <i>correctly</i> (where correctly = everyone is on the same page as far as what the game's about and what they want to get out of it, and all are having a good time).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197024/#Comment_197024" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T14:24:19+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  2:24PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About 1: you can set the stake as "the npc will admit the poisoning", but you, as the player, have really no authority on stating what an NPC does, thinks or says. Depending on how the conflict goes it could be that your words were so convincing that the man will break down and cry, and admit his sin. Or maybe you'll have to beat the crap out of him until he admits his guilt. Or you'll win the conflict after shooting him in one leg. The narrative weight of such scenes will be much different, and the moral standing of your character will be different, obviously.<br/><br/>But, this is not Primetime Adventures: the winner of the conflict does not get to narrate the outcome. You only have authority on *your* character's actions, words and feelings. Sure, if you insert some bit of random color nobody will oppose like say, narrating in objects from the scene, the weather, even the words or actions of a secondary character, but as soon as those elements become more than that (color, important for the mood, but inconsequential for the conflicts) the GM has control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197031/#Comment_197031" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T15:08:22+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  3:08PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, great.

They're rather odd, and it's best to be clear how you might use them.<br/><br/>Everyone will <i>know</i> whether or not the NPC poisoned the guy: the GM will know it, because it's part of the town; the players and characters will know it, because the GM will have told them. If the NPC denies it, everyone will know whether he's lying or not: no roll needed, you just know.<br/><br/>In fact, the doctor will probably have told the Dogs, straight out, that he poisoned the guy: "Yeah, I poisoned him. He stuck his nose into my business". But, OK. It's possible he hasn't actually admitted it (perhaps the GM says "He denies it, but you can see he's lying").<br/><br/><i>Then</i> you might use the stakes "The NPC will admit the poisoning". You don't do it to find out whether he poisoned the guy: you <i>know</i> he poisoned the guy. You do it to make him admit it publicly. And he either does or he doesn't.<br/><br/>Honestly, Hansel, there's not <i>much</i> point analysing at the level of "How could we have handled these stakes better"?

You as a player don't have to know it all. Actively revealing the town in play doesn't actually mean that you know every single thing. It means that the situation comes to the Dogs like a bull charging a waving cape, not like a dentist pulling teeth.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that particular situation, I don't think it's important to know out of character whether or not the doctor did it. What's important is that you're wanting a confession. It may be a lie, and it may be the truth. If you care to know out of character, ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nDog: I want him to confess.<br/>\nGM: Just because he confesses doesn't mean he did it.<br/>\nDog: Did he do it?<br/>\nGM: No.<br/>\nDog: I still want him to confess.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I found out, in our first Dogs town, that we'd totally missed a patch of sin (in addition to the other crap going on, Job Crane's two wives were going lesbo) and rode out of town, I was like "Huh. Interesting. If the game lasts long enough, we should definitely come back and see what's come of that."<br/>\n<br/>\nWith regards to your second question.. If all Dogs present want in on the contest, let 'em. But, in my mind, it makes perfect sense for the second Dog to stand by. He's not invested in the stakes (getting a confession, say) so he doesn't participate. Maybe it escalates to fighting where he will be invested, so that's when you'd use the helping rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it may come down to is that the other Dog doesn't want to be left out. He doesn't want to watch the conflict. He's invested more in being a part of any conflict than he is that particular one. Likewise, it may be that he's not interested at first, but he thinks he might have something to say later on, (if it escalates to fighting, for instance) so he decides to go all in up front, so as to not lock himself out of the conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you think a contest will be more interesting with the mechanical weight of only one Dog, then consider having the Dog who's more invested turn to his buddy and say "I got this. Just stand by the door and make sure he doesn't do anything stupid." If he does, you can either bring in the other Dog with helping dice, or give on that conflict and initiate a follow-up conflict. "He's running! That's an obvious sign of guilt, as good as a confession in my book! Get 'im!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197043/#Comment_197043" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T17:13:51+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  5:13PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2009 5:17PM by noclue.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hansel, the way its suppose to work is that when the players ask questions and GM keeps feeding them information.
