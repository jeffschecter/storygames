A typical game (or story) lasts about the same number of sessions as there are players, and campaigns (or histories as they referred to in the game) are very short. It is unlikely that any player's rebel will last for more than a few stories as they are in a certain sense doomed to be removed from the story whatever their player does. <br/><br/>I terms of genre I'm not sure exactly where it fits in. I'm terrible at making those kind of distinctions. I want to say that it could be low fantasy and possibly urban fantasy. Is low urban fantasy a genre? Is a game urban fantasy if it is not a modern setting?<br/><br/>The system for resolving challenges in the game involves players voting for an outcome by dropping coloured beads into a bag and the player facing that challenge blindly drawing some of those beads out of a bag. The combination of beads he draws determines what happens to his rebel.<br/><br/>The game is very much about exploring the darkness within the hearts of the rebels as much as it is about the tyrannical regime they are trying to overthrow. My own experience playing Bleake Rebellion is that while it can delve into some harrowing subjects, it engenders a kind of black humour that makes failure as enjoyable as success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423430/#Comment_423430" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-28T05:05:14+00:00" title="October 28, 2013  5:05AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\u2014 What does "fair and even handed" mean?</blockquote>\nBy fair and even-handed I mean that all the players have the power to influence the outcome of the challenges that the rebels face.

I can't say how well it would work, but I suspect that if your table has a knack for understanding their characters' motives and can quickly see how to build a story from the consequences of their character's actions it might work pretty well. I think it would also help to have a historian (a sort of GM) who keeps the story moving, who knows when to start a new scene, and is willing to skip to the good parts of the story. <br/><br/>All of the above are useful skills to have however you choose to play, but I think that you'll get more out of stories that take several sessions to complete because it really gives each of the players a chance to shine. I think that a one shot could give the players the same chance, but I wouldn't want to make any promises. <br/><br/>And I'm not sure how it will effect the conversation around the table. By this I mean that the players are supposed to make suggestions and offer ideas and add material to the story. (It's not the kind of game that encourages deeply immersive role-playing). I believe that if you are trying to create a tight one shot and your table doesn't have the time to talk about the story, you won't really be getting the complete experience.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that you can play it as one shot, but I wouldn't recommend trying to do it in a two to three hour session. It needs more time.   <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423488/#Comment_423488" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-29T07:42:35+00:00" title="October 29, 2013  7:42AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks neat.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423502/#Comment_423502" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-29T13:11:43+00:00" title="October 29, 2013  1:11PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2013 1:12PM by MJGraham.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Adam.

In the setting which I have written, amenability and resentment are a pair of contradictory emotions (virtues) that are found in every rebel and they play a large part in their story. "Amenability and resentment" may not be suitable for a western or SF setting, but there's bound to be others that would work. For example, "greed and generosity" in a western about prospectors, gamblers, stagecoach robbers, and cattle rustlers. \n<blockquote>I've ordered a copy! I was holding off, because I liked the premise but didn't know what the mechanics would be like. But beads! <br/><br/>Marcus, what's your background, if you don't mind me asking? What do you play, what inspires you, where are you based and so forth?</blockquote>\nThanks, Graham! I got your email by the way. I'll respond to it after I've written this.<br/><br/>The idea for using beads come from Ralph Mazza's and Mike Holme's "Universalis". This got me thinking about organizations which reject members by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackballing" rel="nofollow">blackballing</a> and the old democratic system of voting for representatives by a kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition" rel="nofollow">lottery</a>. <br/><br/>I'm studying for a degree in psychology, which probably explains why I made emotions a key part of Bleake Rebellion. The odd thing is that I now disagree with one of the biggest psychological assumption I made when writing the game. Namely that emotions are something that happens inside of us.<br/><br/>I don't really get to do much playing now. I spend much more time written games than I do playing them. My gaming background is pretty standard, although I'm currently out of the loop when it comes to the bigger more commercially successful games of recent years (e.g. I know almost nothing about Exalted). <br/><br/>I'm inspired by the creators and the soon-to-be creators who come here. There's no doubt in my mind that their work and their involvement in the community, both within and without this forum, has greatly inspired me. I was inspired to write Bleake Rebellion to fix a problem I had with an earlier game I never finished. I had a character class - the revolutionary - and I didn't know how to make it work within the context of the game. In trying to find an answer to that problem, I ended up shelving the earlier game and writing a new one about revolutionaries. As for the setting, I was toying with the idea of dystopian setting like 1984 or Children of Men or V for Vendetta. But it was reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Watch_(Discworld)" rel="nofollow">Night Watch</a> by Terry Pratchett that made me settle on a more Les Miserables/French Revolution style fantasy setting. (I'm not a humourist like Pratchett, but there are some hidden and not so hidden jokes* in Bleake Rebellion). An odd side note is that the ahriman in Bleake Rebellion come from a song off the album Year Zero by Nine Inch Nails. <br/><br/>In terms of what inspires me now. Well, the OSR movement has inspired me to write what I am calling my love letter to D&amp;D. I'm also working on a game about happy immortals in a magi-tech world. The latter one is a reaction against media and entertainment which is violent and gritty and dark. I'm not against games those kinds of games. I just want to make a game where violence doesn't work so players won't treat it as the default solution to the problems their characters face.   <br/><br/>Oh, I almost forgot to add that I live in northwest England, but I originally hail from the fens of East Anglia. <br/><br/><br/>* You won't laugh if/when you find them. They're not what anyone would call rib-ticklers.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
