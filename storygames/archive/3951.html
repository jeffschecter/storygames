I do not know what Egypt's current government is like. I know almost nothing about Madagascar's climate. I do not know what countries surround Sudan.<br/><br/>Now, imagine that there are hundreds of human inhabited worlds. And, now, imagine that hyper-distortion-cheater-warp drives have not been developed or perfected. But still we've expanded.<br/><br/>Communication between them is sparse, because that kind of communication takes forever and requires a fair bit of resources. Furthermore, it's unlikely that Planet A can communicate directly with Planet F. They probably have to use chain communication between Planets B and D and E just to get their messages back and forth.<br/><br/>A planet is a huge place. Imagine planets three times the size of earth, with six times the population and ten times the cultural diversity. Imagine all the new religions born out of technology and the stars.<br/><br/>Maybe imagine aliens, maybe not.<br/><br/>The point is, if someone asked "I wonder what life is like on Kethai?" I would have absolutely no idea.  Revolutions could happen on a neighbouring world and I might not find out for months. Hell, the original government might be restored before its first communique for help came through.<br/><br/>I think the idea of intergalactic empire in sci-fi... Well, it's not boring... but it's tired. It's a default now, and that's stupid. Space spells independance like nothing else.<br/><br/>And what's more annoying than the baseline assumption of galactic empire is that it also default assumes that planets will have singular governments... That Kethai will have central leadership.<br/><br/>So I propose something else: Picture a science fiction universe. Hell, our universe. In every solar system, only a third of the planets are inhabitable. Lots of systems are inhabited, but no one has an encyclopedic knowledge of how far humankind has gotten. Only in system X and system Y is there any information known about the state of system Z. On a planetary level, governments are patchwork and non-solidified. It's just as messy as our world is now. Although communication is widespread on a planetary level, it's too much to know it all. Planets operate huge trade and industry between each other, but sometimes interplanetary travel and search can take months or years.<br/><br/>The galaxy is a myriad of places that don't know about each other. Humanity is a race which doesn't know its population, its reach, its discoveries any longer. You could spend your entire life exploring a country and never learn all its secrets, never mind trying to gain a comprehensive knowledge of a world. Nevermind a system.<br/><br/>The galaxy is simply unfathomably huge and unknowable. If you leave a planet for ten years and return, it is a new place altogether. The same spices used to create entirely new cuisine. The same governments backing entirely different agendas. Maybe. Maybe different governments altogether.<br/><br/>I think this sci-fi vision is a far cooler one than that of unity and empire.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88638/#Comment_88638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T16:09:50+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  4:09PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other part of this is that a cool Realmwalker might walk into a saloon on Kethai and the citizens would be like:<br/><br/>Citizens: What's a realmwalker?<br/>Realmwalker: We're psions of ancient and mystical power.

To use an odd analogy only available within this hobby, it sounds a lot like playing Planescape. The planets, and solar systems, are essentially alternate planes. Some people on each plane will be aware or having dealings with other planes, but the majority will be ignorant or uncaring about any plane but their own. Play can take place in a single plane, or can span several, and if a setting gets tired play can move to another with minimal effort.<br/><br/>Cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88653/#Comment_88653" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T17:33:40+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  5:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a very cool and very Vancian vision of the universe: the Gaean Reach, rather than the Third Imperium.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I'm reminded of Kim Stanley Robinson's <b>Red Mars</b> and its sequels, which showed just how diverse a single planet could be.<br/><br/>I would totally play a Red Mars rpg.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88654/#Comment_88654" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-17T18:25:09+00:00" title="August 17, 2007  6:25PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2007 6:33PM by WillH.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I f travel and communication took months or year I think the relationship between earth and other planets would be very similar to the relationship between Europe and the new world prior to the invention of the steam engine.<br/><br/>Edit:  This is assuming we ignore relativity.

The sphere of human colonization extended out 50 light years from earth, and although colonies were  started by spacefaring nations, things were starting to reach a point where national affiliations didn't mean so much, and independence movements were growing. All of this was further enhanced by the fact that messages traveled at the speed of the fastest ship (and a trip to the end of the colonial arms took over a month even on the fastest ships). Out in the colonial frontier, if you got in trouble, you were on your own. Sure you could send a message, but by the time anyone even managed to read the message (much less get a rescue mission going) you might already be dead.<br/><br/>So in the hyper developed core around Earth and Alpha Centauri (the nearest colonized world to Terra), no one cared too much about alien assaults on the last colony way out at the end of the Arms, that is, when the news finally reached them a month late.<br/><br/>Running campaigns on colony worlds in this setting (and keeping them there) was easy as pie. The feeling of isolation from the rest of the travel routes could easily be played up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian" title="Malthusian"><img alt="Malthusian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malthusian">Malthusian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88675/#Comment_88675" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-18T01:27:50+00:00" title="August 18, 2007  1:27AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my home-brew sci-fi I've always played with the idea that there are a half dozen intelligent species other than humans out in the galaxies, but then there are some human colonies that aren't even aware of a single one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88677/#Comment_88677" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-18T01:42:19+00:00" title="August 18, 2007  1:42AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael, what are the alien races?<br/><br/>Are they similar to humans?

We should fire up a Mars Trilogy fan thread. (Or, I could just reread that trilogy...)<br/><br/>As for the topic at a hand:<br/><br/>Totally astute. Granted doing something like this means we're jettisonning all the space opera trappings that are fun, but we'll get something else cool instead. If you're sticking with relativity rules, then yeah - generations will pass as you planet-hop, so when you leave a world you're basically leaving that place (as you know it, with all of its inhabitants) behind for good.<br/><br/>One scenario that could be neat for this (inspired by the Relativists from Orion's Arm): a trade ship loads up in one world with what they can only guess is a profitable cargo, then run to another world (several years in the future sa well) and hope that world is one that cares for what they brought. If it turns out the Ryxian desire for platinum goods was a fad, well, that sucks. What's more: the trade ship accepts willing workers at any port, but these would have to be people who are willing to blank out their entire pasts, since they can never go back. What kinds of people would sign on for a trip like that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/george" title="george"><img alt="george" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/george">george</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88697/#Comment_88697" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-18T07:03:06+00:00" title="August 18, 2007  7:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            C.J.

Turns out there are about 200 star systems that might be habitable within 50 lightyears, which is just close enough to make contact between worlds tempting, but just far enough to make it fraught with complications.  (Travel could be achieved by a magnetic ramscoop, which gets you pretty close to the speed of light after a year or two of acceleration.)  <br/><br/>The thing to remember about a star system is that, if it's got a half-way habitable world, it's likely to be pretty self-sufficient if you bring enough crap with you.  (And, if you've already got the $$$ for a colony-ship, presumably you've got the money and brains to bring what you'll need.)  In the real world, the main impetus for colonization was to harvest raw materials; in an STL space setting, the distances &amp; costs of interstellar travel are extremely high and odds are you can get most of the raw materials in your own backyard.

Art and cultural info could still be very valuable as luxury commodities, and you'd probably need to know about their scientific or industrial advances too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88707/#Comment_88707" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-18T08:49:11+00:00" title="August 18, 2007  8:49AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<pre>I think this sci-fi vision is a far cooler one than that of unity and empire\n</pre>\n<br/>\nI think this depends on what you'd like your sci-fi to be.

Variants on humans? Different entirely? Do they have sweeping empires too? Are all of them aware of humans?</br></blockquote>\nThe 2300AD aliens are just that, <i>alien</i>. They are products of their environments and thus very <i>non-human</i>. You cannot play alien characters in 2300AD, and the only people likely to encounter aliens are scientists, certain colonists, and the unlucky soldiers fighting the <i>bugs</i> (see below). IMO, 2300AD has some of the best alien races ever developed for an RPG setting. there are quite a few of them, and that sometimes puts people off, but you can't say they aren't interesting.<br/><br/>The <i>Kafers</i> (German for bug - please don't get started on the South African use of the word...) are humanoid and bipedal, and have similar technology to humans, but that's where the similarity ends. Violence stimulates their intelligence biochemically, and drives them to war with whoever is around them to stay smart.<br/><br/>The Pentapods are amphibians from a waterworld that are actually biomechanical constructs of a larger sentient group-mind (if you can grasp that). They do everything with biological constructs. Humans build a spaceship. Pentapods <i>raise</i> a spaceship that is <i>alive</i> and <i>sentient</i>. With no concept of individuality, they are really hard to communicate with.<br/><br/>The Sung are a vaguely sauroid race from a low gravity homeworld. Thus, they can fly, and do so between their towering city structures. They developed spaceflight on their own but lacked interstellar capability. Humans showed up, saw that the Sung had enslaved another sentient alien race (the Xiang), and then whipped the Sung in a very short war. The Sung now consider themselves the understudy of humanity.<br/><br/>The Xiang are very weird. Kind of like spiders, sentient but at a very primitive level of technology. They are spawned from large, earthbound organisms that are like plants or a fungus. Weird.<br/><br/>The Eber are also very weird. Ten foot tall bipeds with fur, three eyes on stalks, very long arms, and medieval technology. They were once an advanced  starfaring race with interstellar colonies, but blasted themselves back to the stone age (literally) in a tragic war.<br/><br/>There are one or two more races, but these are the main ones you can really do something with in the game. Dealing with the aliens in 2300AD really is different from many SF games, it's much more of a hard SF approach.  I just wrapped up a short campaign based on the Pentapods and it was a blast - very Arthur Clarke-type stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88723/#Comment_88723" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-18T12:04:13+00:00" title="August 18, 2007 12:04PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2007 12:06PM by Mcdaldno.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fun possibilities in such a setting:<br/><br/>-Some humans have, in some climates and systems, evolved.

Okay, so if you have a universe full of planets (ie "cultural entities") that don't really have that much contact with each other, or travel times between them are closer to, say, 18th century sea trips between New York and Calcutta, then you're gonna have one major problem with "Blind Drops" - the language barrier. If Mr. Realmwalker dude just drops in, he speaks Language A, and all the locals speak Language B. Unless he has Telepathy, of course, in which case the locals worship him as a god or burn him as a witch - not exactly what you're looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course we have various international languages and trade languages operating in the world today, and likely that would continue into space - different versions of English, French, Spanish are spoken throughout dozens of countries. English especially unites ESL speakers in Europe, Asia and Africa. You have trade languages like Swahili in Africa and Pidgin in the Pacific. And there's plenty of other ways to get around the problem, but let's face it - the language barrier in rpgs, just like in real life, is no fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a purely planetary scale, one government might be the cliche of viewing planets as Wilsonian Nations, each with a single flavor (represented by a single geographic feature, a single culture, a sigle industry, a single government), but it's supported by technology. The key is Orbital Supremacy. I mean, we're talking about a universe with interstellar space travel - orbital satellites are NOT gonna be the piddly junkers we have today. Once you take control of Orbit, you own the planet. Surveillance will be vastly superior than it is today, and you can apparently read over a man's shoulder from space now. Combine that with orbital bombardment - death lasers, guided smartbombs - and you control the surface of the planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat only applies to government, though. Military control = political control. One culture, one industry, and especially one geographical feature is highly unlikely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88788/#Comment_88788" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-19T12:25:54+00:00" title="August 19, 2007 12:25PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The language problem can easily be explained away - computer systems dedicated to picking up language could be translating for the PCs.

If humans can live in it, sensors can cut right through it. Right now, we can see lakes on the surface of Venus! Infrared, ultraviolet, sonar, radar, fractal reconstruction, facial recognition, multiple angles, comm signal analysis, joint surveillance with ground sources, 3d imaging simulation, electrical scanning, gravity well detection, blah, blah, blah. Jamming technology is only a temporary solution - it doesn't hold up under pressure. Even the slightest lapse and anything immobile is compromised.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial instability is possible, sure - take Africa, add the AK47 - but actual organized resistance movements or shadow governments are going to need some serious, serious geographical conditions to stay viable on a planet where hostile forces have Orbital Supremacy. Deep underground, or society lives in artificial stations in a disgustingly hostile atmosphere (thick gas giant with bizarre sensor-jamming materials). They're going to need multiple and preferably moving points of contact with the outside world, otherwise these points can be discovered and shut down.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere might be political reasons for something other than a single entity controlling a planet, but technologically, if you got all the stuff you need to colonize the universe, you got all the stuff you need to make orbital supremacy a reality. The real problem, conceptually, narratively, is that it reinforces the old stereotypes and cliches - which do not have enough merit to stand on their own. A planet really is a compartmentalized section of space. You can't just come and go like it's Cuba or some other island on Earth, and it ain't cheap to travel through space. It's when you finally get down onto the planet that you have to watch out - there's gonna be more there than just "the desert planet with the giant worms" or "the ocean planet with gigantic underwater cities."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nicklessguy" title="Nicklessguy"><img alt="Nicklessguy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nicklessguy">Nicklessguy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88814/#Comment_88814" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-19T19:09:28+00:00" title="August 19, 2007  7:09PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2007 7:09PM by Nicklessguy.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>-I'd personally say "fuck you" to relativity and make travel times be identical to "on-world" times.</blockquote>\nWell, why?<br/>It seems to me it was a kind of hard sci-fi concept you were seeking, so it would be a pity to throw out SR without a good reason.<br/><br/>Expecially since...\n<blockquote> But voyages would still take months to years to carry out. Any space travel would be seen as a gigantic, life-changing, life-abandoning mission. You would grow old without your friends nearby. You would leave knowing that you'd miss your newborn's first day at school, her graduation, her acceptance into the Academy... you'd pray that if the voyage was a short one you'd make it back in time for her wedding. Of course, you'd be an old man by then.</blockquote>\n...you can have all that with relativity. And if you're not travelling at super-speeds, you'll also get travel time as seen on the spaceship quite close to travel time as seen on the planets (supposing they are at rest wrt each other :P). Remember that to get a time dilation factor of 2 (i.e. to have a 10 years travel look like a 5 years travel to you) you need to travel at about 0.87 c, not 0.5 (which is however a friggin' high velocity).<br/><br/>Something like a 0.25 c velocity could be what you're looking for. At that speed, a Sol-Alpha Centauri travel would take about 20 years as seen from people on planet, and just a bunch of months less than that from the pilot's perspective. A quite irrelevant difference in aging, without needs of saying "fuck you" to science.<br/><br/>And not having people age too much during travel (whether through hibernation or time-dilation it is almost the same; I'm not advocating forceful use of the second mechanism) could allow to have the "space-traveller" kind of character, who has forsaken nonetheless life and loves on his/her planet of origin, but at least can get to do more than one-two travels in his/her lifetime.<br/><br/>Sorry if I have geeked too much. Probably I tend to do that late at night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88816/#Comment_88816" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-19T19:36:28+00:00" title="August 19, 2007  7:36PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paolo, thanks.

It sounds like we can blame the continuous use of 'Holy Roman Empire' as the breakdown of that word.<br/><br/>But an Empire in the more classical sense would be interesting too.  I like the idea of a planet with multiple governments, each part belonging to a different Empire.  This doesn't even necessarily need to be a source of contention. <br/><br/>(That said, regardless of the nature of interstellar relationships if any, the idea that planets will have singular governments, assuming they are colonized, is not entirely far-fetched. A colony started in the age of instant communication, at least on a planetary scale, will probably have less cultural and thus governmental drift than one that started like ours, in ancient times where various nations and cultures warred from the birth of our "Earth colonialism."  Barring multiple competing colonial governmental organizations on a single planet (which I think would be unlikely in a place where 1/3 of all systems are inhabitable - easier just to go to the first uninhabited one) the ones with multiple governments are more likely to be exceptions, at least on an extra-stellar level.)<br/><br/>Simon:  Genuinely alien aliens probably, y'know, cannot be played by humans at all.  We have to have SOME concessions for the humanity within the aliens, or the players we have will probably be unable to play them.  That said, I agree that we could move further away from "humans in rubber suits" and still have playable alien-ness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88826/#Comment_88826" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-19T21:35:30+00:00" title="August 19, 2007  9:35PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: aliens.<br/><br/>I'd prefer to see something where the aliens were plausibly evolved.
