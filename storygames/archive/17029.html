Anne has just shaved her head and looks wicked hot, and I forgot to read the rules for all of the other reasonable one-shot games we could have done, so we grabbed Mist-Robed Gate.<br/><br/>The first thing decided upon when sitting down to talk about the type of movie we wanted was that because Anne is bald she should play a warrior monk, cold as stone and flecked with snow. Naturally I should be the prideful brother who betrays the temple, with harsh steel gloves, a serpentine name, wreathed in fog. Geoffrey would be the disgraced foreigner from the country at war with ours, clutching the ragged purple cloth that was all that remained of his station, taking refuge at the temple to wait out the storm that's brewing. Jessie would watch for a good chunk of the game, being roped in to play bit parts here and there before being handed a knife and told to make a character sheet because if he doesn't his young earnest monk, with his prayer beads and orange robes, is going to die.<br/><br/>We kicked off Act One with some brief scenes, mostly panning shots, introducing my traitorous ex-monk watching the temple, Jessie's bit character bursting into the inner sanctum of the Scholars (who are never to be disturbed) to tell Anne's character about the capture of monks down by the river, the locking down of the temple to ward off the man that waits in the fog, and Geoffrey's foreigner bargaining his way inside.<br/><br/>Its worth mentioning how effective it was early on to have everything defined as a movie. We had a great time describing stylistic flourishes, immaculately timed camera tricks (one flashback has my character, not such an asshole as he becomes, sneak up behind some young boys the temple has taken in, and have them notice with a start when the camera snaps into focus on him), and expansive panning shots of the environment. Often scenes would be composed entirely of some dramatic piece of atmosphere and a single piece of narrative information. Trees falling in the distance, accompanied by fog. A storm churning up the side of the mountain. The first flakes of snow falling.<br/><br/>There's a couple of scenes where my character sneaks into Anne's character's chamber to alternately threaten and cajole him into letting him back into the temple, giving him his birthright. When he refuses, I cross out my allegiance to The Temple (the building, not the people in it), and write down Revenge instead. Geoffrey's foreigner wanders the palisades at night with a lantern, possibly alerting the coming army, and Anne's character teaches him a lesson in asceticism and sobriety by knocking his flask away with a sword. The mood is tense, there are the green creeping vines of my character everywhere, and a purple sunset in the horizon, and for the first time in the game the knife has been uncovered.<br/><br/>But there's monks held captive down by the river, and Jessie is really worried about that, so he asks if he can frame a scene. We're like \u201cSure!\u201d so he grabs a bunch of young monks from the temple to burst into my character's tent (now I'm working for the invading army!), and I tell him right then that he'd better write up a character sheet or I'm going to kill him. The knife gets handed over, and I'm pretty sure Jessie wants me to let them go. I'm okay with that, but I tell him he has to take them to the Scholars' inner sanctum. They've got a very important message to deliver. Jessie can't let the Scholars be disturbed, so he stabs my character sheet and my character's iron gloves tighten and break one of his ribs.<br/><br/>So, we had a bit of difficulty throughout the game with the Knife Ritual, and it started here. Part of it was misreading the rules and I'll cop to that straight out. We eventually got it right, I think. We referred more to the character sheets than to the book because honestly they made more sense (except for later, and I'll get to that).<br/><br/>It wound up with wire-fu, and with the monks making a perimeter for the two characters to fight. After being separated by a fire (after Jessie's character did a flip over the fire and flicked coals in my eyes!) the knife got calmed, and I just ended up letting the monks go anyways. With characters carved all bloody into their foreheads.<br/><br/>Back at the temple, Anne's character watches the bleeding, hobbling monks approach, and prepares a fire with seven burning steel rods in it. Her character has the rest of the temple surround the entrance, and let the seven monks enter, along with Jesse's character. She has her character tell him to take the rods and cauterize the wounds, and he does so without question. Some of the monks suffer in perfect silence. The rest of them scream. When he approaches Anne's character later to ask why, he says that one does not let chaos and disease enter into the order of one's home. Jesse's character confides in another monk that he's not so certain he wants to be a monk anymore, while Geoffrey's character watches and listens in the background.<br/><br/>Another thing that we found was cool to do was toss each other bones. Like, earlier on after Geoffrey's scene on the palisades being all scolded for having lantern and drinking, I had my character presumably respond to a rhythmic light signalling from the top of the walls. Geoffrey's character was just dropped into that last scene there, out of focus, no interaction, almost as a prop. There were a couple of points where I would have preferred to have left something a bit more ambiguous than it was, like for example when Jesse made my character a home at the invading army encampment, but the rules for narrational authority are pretty fuzzy and it worked out in the end in any case.<br/><br/>Act One finished at one in the morning, with the smoke from the invading army, trees toppling as they clear a path for the cannon, and my character walking among them, thinking of his childhood.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell" title="KirkMitchell"><img alt="KirkMitchell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell">KirkMitchell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386971/#Comment_386971" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T07:51:43+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  7:51AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We thanked everyone for staying over so late to play with us, and decided to meet up the next day to wrap up the story. It started off with a few brief scenes, mostly flashbacks. Geoffrey quietly wrote down \u201cGun\u201d on one of his prop cards during one of his scenes. Anne's character had breakfast while Geoffrey's character warned Jessie's character that if the gates did not open, they would fall.<br/><br/>The movie climaxed with the army arriving at the gates, and two simultaneous fight scenes: one between my character and Anne's, one between Geoffrey's and Jessie's. Anne's character went out to go preach at the generals, but I was like \u201coh fuck no, I'm taking off after you on the treetops, and you'd better run or the family sword takes family blood.\u201d And Jessie's character is not going to take any suggestions of treachery and takes on the foreigner and his gun with nothing but prayer beads and fists and dirt (in a nice stylistic flourish, everywhere that the stray bullets landed, a lightning bolt struck. Pretty rad.)<br/><br/>Anne's character lost mine in the mist at a waterfall at the base of the mountain, and Geoffrey's character signalled the army with a flare to fire at the gates. The gates shatter and crumble into rubble, crushing the body of the poor young monk. Jessie prophesies that the surviving monks will recover his body and move elsewhere, to start a new temple with less violent teachings. With the only defender of the temple gone, lost for a while in the fog, the soldiers take it with no bloodshed. Geoffrey's character has secured a prize worthy enough to reclaim his lost honour in his homeland. By the time that Anne's character shows up the place is thoroughly seized by the army, and there is nothing he can do about it. He's headed in to the inner sanctum of the Scholars when my character shows up and demands that I be let in. There's a thunk as I drive the blade into her character sheet, and I don't like the way she smiles at me. Before I know it, the blade is on my skin, and she tells me she'll do it, but I must take this wax sealed scroll to another temple, renounce my family name, and never return.<br/><br/>Here, sadly, there was another issue. We had no idea whether escalating from bloodied to holding the knife to the other player's skin meant that the character who was stabbed in the first place still died or not. Here's how we played it out: Kirk picks up the bloodied knife, and stabs Anne's character sheet, demanding to be let in. Anne escalates, assumes that her character is still going to die at the end of the scene, and threatens to kill me immediately if I do not agree to take the scroll and leave afterwards.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>Kirk -&gt; Anne (going to die at end of scene)<br/>Anne (going to die at end of scene) -&gt; Kirk (acquiesces, and doesn't die)<br/><br/>The same issue comes up if the player deflects the stab to someone else: does this mean that they both die? Conceivably the knife could travel pretty far and then you've got a room full of bodies. The other alternative that we came up with but did not choose to use, was that only the character with the knife currently in their sheet at the end of the scene dies.<br/><br/>Inside the inner sanctum, the monks are too slumped to be meditating. Something is wrong. Quite uncharacteristic of him, Anne's character kicks over one with his foot. Mass suicide at breakfast. They found the enlightenment they were looking for, and the scroll is their teachings. Enraged at having his revenge taken, my character runs Anne's through with the family sword. Anne's character tenderly takes the face of mine, and prophesies that he will find peace.<br/><br/>The credits roll over the mass exodus of the monks, Jessie's character's body carried with reverence among them, my character holding a scroll and watching the fog gently ebb and sway as the first flakes of snow fall, heralding winter.<br/><br/>- - - - - - - -<br/><br/>Observations:<br/><br/>First of all, that was fucking brutal. And awesome. There was a scene I didn't talk about where there was fog enshrouding the canopy of trees like the surface of a lake, and with every wire-fu footstep there was a rippling gap left to reveal the green leaves beneath. There was an awesome flashback giving the background of Jessie's character and his fight with a temple bully over soup. There was gasps and jaws dropping aplenty at the end. One of them was my own. Holy shit.<br/><br/>And yeah, there was all that difficulty we had with the Knife Ritual, which did not seem all that clear in the text, and we read it a good three or four times each time we ran into trouble. Maybe someone could help us out here?<br/><br/>There were also a few things that I think I figured out that are kinda important to bring into my own thoughts on game design. I know Mist-Robed Gates is well out of playtest and I find it kind of gauche to call for revisions of a published game, but it definitely highlighted to me exactly how important it is to clearly demarcate narrative authority. We were pretty easy going and at least Anne and I have some improv experience, but there are times when having a clear yet nuanced understanding of narrational authority would have led to a smoother and subtler experience, particularly when narrating another player's character into the scene. You're bringing them in: do you just say they are there? Are they there doing something? Going somewhere? Are they there in the middle of something? Do they have intention? We chose, somewhat later in the game, to codify things and say it is okay to narrate a player character up until the point they have intention, a decision to make, or an involved action to participate in. Its totally okay to drop hints by having Geoffrey's character always hanging around (not suspiciously because that's intention, but just in the shot and out of focus), whenever there's an opportunity for treachery, but to say \u201cHey, I see Geoffrey's signal to the army, and go to tell them its time to attack\u201d is getting out of bounds.<br/><br/>The final thing I thought of while musing on the game and washing dishes was that the wire-fighting mechanics are about as structured as the in-character kung-fu fighting I did with my friends in high-school. Awesome imaginary visuals, but some difficulty keeping up steam or having extremely dramatic moments (kicking someone to the ground and having them be vulnerable for a moment is really hard, even if it has no mechanical effect, because they can be like \u201cnah, I grab hold of a tree branch and kick you in the face). It pointed out to me how much I rely upon mechanics as a dramatic pacing mechanism as much as a resolution mechanic. Even if wire-fu is still resolved by vote for awesomeness, I would have appreciated a bit of mechanical aid to let me know who is on top, who is vulnerable, who is having a surprise upsurge of violence and corners me mercilessly.<br/><br/>So all in all we had a fantastic time. It was the first intro to indie RPGs for Jessie and Geoffrey, and they had a blast. And I learned a thing or two about games that might come in handy!

We're technically still in talks, and a call for a snazzy new 2nd edition from enthusiastic players such as yourselves would go farther than you'd think.<br/><br/>The Knife Ritual's always difficult. A bloodied knife basically just means the <b>stakes</b> are life-or-death for the character who's bloodied. But that (maybe undramatically) doesn't mean they have to die. If Anne elected to deflect into Kyle ("I'm taking you with me!"), then Kyle's character would have to die if Anne's did, since she actually invested her last ounce of breath to make sure that happened (cf <i>Hero</i>). But if it's deflected into someone else (a third party) present, I would run it as a stakes thing: that scene has suddenly become about life and death for them, and they have to separately choose what they want to do with the knife from there.<br/><br/>Yes, MRG is a bloody, bloody game in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386978/#Comment_386978" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T08:57:16+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  8:57AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Kirk!<br/><br/><i>The same issue comes up if the player deflects the stab to someone else: does this mean that they both die?

The <i>knife entering your character sheet</i>indicates that you die at-or-before the end of the scene; you have flexibility in how to answer any questions that got sent your way, but "Do I die?" is not a question. I usually expect the game to end with all the most interesting characters deceased.<br/><br/>If you want to keep talking about this, please feel free to dig me up at G+; I prefer not to use this forum because it's full of racist assholes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell" title="KirkMitchell"><img alt="KirkMitchell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell">KirkMitchell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386979/#Comment_386979" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T09:06:26+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  9:06AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Evan! There's still some ambiguities I'm struggling with. Here's what I'm seeing:<br/><br/>Anne just got stabbed for some reason. Lets say its "Open the gates (and implicit in the stab "or I'll kill you")".<br/>Anne -deflects (bloodied)-&gt; Kyle and demands "If I die, so do you."<br/>So Kyle needs to agree to keep Anne's character alive somehow, at threat of his own character's death.<br/><br/>What's missing here is two things: The rules need to make it clear that you can demand to be kept alive on pain of death. Also, what happens to the original demand? By my understanding of the rules as writ, it should be:<br/><br/>Anne just got stabbed. "Open the gates (or I'll kill you)"<br/>Anne -deflects (bloodied)-&gt; Kyle and demands "Open the gates, and keep me alive (or I'll kill you)"<br/>So now Kyle is responsible for opening the gates and keeping Anne's character alive.<br/><br/>And the second example is more confusing:<br/><br/>Anne just got stabbed. "Open the gates (or I'll kill you)"<br/>Anne -deflects (bloodied)-&gt;Some Poor Schmuck, and demands "Open the gates, but kill the Sages! Nobody must see them alive! (or I'll kill you)"<br/>So now Some Poor Schmuck is saddled with making sure the gates are open, killing the sages, and generally his day is ruined. And Anne's character is in limbo: technically she's fulfilled the demand, so does she die? But it says right there on the character sheet I've got that if you've been stabbed, you can either escalate (knife to the skin, obedience or immediate death), deflect (pass the buck), or accept the demand and die (plus make a sweet prophesy).<br/><br/>Does Anne's character still die? Does the demand get fulfilled? Who does it get fulfilled by? Can Some Poor Schmuck just stab someone else and pass the buck onto them? And if so, does Some Poor Schmuck die as well, unless they demand to be kept alive?<br/><br/>Another thing we kicked around while playing was the idea of lying, or promising what you couldn't ensure. For example, Jessie stabbed Geoffrey's character to ask that the foreigner to ensure that if the gates fall, there will be no harm to the monks. Geoffrey said he probably couldn't promise that, because he wasn't in charge of the army, and we all ummed and hummed and eventually decided fuck it, wirework. It worked itself out from there, but it would have been nice to have a system in place whereby you promise something to the best of the knowledge of the inquirer, and can renege on it onscreen or offscreen, and if they find out, they can just cut straight to stabbing the character sheet or something. You can promise anything, but until that debt is fulfilled your life is not your own. Or something. I fucking love dumplings and tea, but I reckon a more robust stakes and bargaining system might be a better use of page-space than recipes (sidebars for the tea education, maybe).<br/><br/>Still, the game made us some sweet blood-drenched drama and tragedy. I'd love to see a second edition. Definitely drop me a line if you need it playtested. I'd be happy to return to part two and play my character as a wizened old sage, haunted by his violent past, trying desperately to find the peace he was foretold.<br/><br/>By the way: what is your favourite surface to stab? We used old encyclopedias.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-G3cIGFHQcO8/UCkl3f2b_yI/AAAAAAAAADc/xv3IJoTd_sM/s512/IMG_20120812_135902.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell" title="KirkMitchell"><img alt="KirkMitchell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell">KirkMitchell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386980/#Comment_386980" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T09:08:09+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  9:08AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas!

I see it as the knife entering your character sheet as always prompting the same decision tree.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell" title="KirkMitchell"><img alt="KirkMitchell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell">KirkMitchell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386994/#Comment_386994" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T12:22:23+00:00" title="August 13, 2012 12:22PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the way that works out in play is that once you've stabbed someone, either they escalate and lash right back at you, there's wire-fu which may or may not change anything, or you've got a potential cascade of dead bodies, 'cause really, you're dead already, you might as well take some fuckers with you.<br/><br/>Actually, speaking of Wirefighting, two questions:<br/><br/>1) At the end of the fight scene, if you've been handed the knife but not stabbed, do you hold onto the knife until you use it or it is taken from you by wirefighting, or do you put it back on the table.<br/><br/>2) At the end of the fight scene, do you still have to accept and perform the demand that was given to you beforehand?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387011/#Comment_387011" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T17:21:53+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  5:21PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So stabbage is the top of the escalate chain: you can't escalate past that. If you get stabbed you have a couple choices: (1) try not to die, by going to wirework and fighting for your life; or (2) doing something else with your last few moments, including stabbing someone else. If you stab someone else, they can try to fight for their life too, but you're definitely dead. If they don't win their fight, they're definitely dead too. Hope that's clear.<br/><br/>AFAIK, nobody should be holding the knife if they are not performing part of the knife ritual (i.e. making or responding to a knife-ritual command). It should be there on the table for anybody else currently involved in the scene to take up.<br/><br/>Also AFAIK, the consequences that come out of the fight are decided by the winner of the fight, who chooses options from a list, right? And one of them is that they can make you do a thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell" title="KirkMitchell"><img alt="KirkMitchell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell">KirkMitchell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387018/#Comment_387018" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T20:12:32+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  8:12PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2012 8:16PM by KirkMitchell.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the dead-ness of characters post-stab but sans wirework win is crystal clear. There is the "hold the knife to your opponent's skin" as an escalation up from being stabbed, which I would interpret as a last ditch attempt to get something you want before you die, but since the character sheet didn't actually get stabbed we interpreted that as if you accept then you get to live.<br/><br/>The knife-holding thing we worked out in play as such, but again, its not explicit in the rules. Maybe it doesn't need to be, and we were all just distracted by Anne's baldness.<br/><br/>As for the consequences that come out of the fight, here's where I'm struggling again:<br/><br/>Kirk -demands (bloodied)-&gt; Anne to "do A Thing!"<br/>Anne escalates to wire-work, and wins "Calm the knife".

The knife ritual is just there to illustrate the structure: it's mostly descriptive, not prescriptive. When in doubt, go with what makes sense in the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell" title="KirkMitchell"><img alt="KirkMitchell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KirkMitchell">KirkMitchell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387030/#Comment_387030" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T22:12:12+00:00" title="August 13, 2012 10:12PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
