Here we go.<br/><br/>So, back at the end of September, I made an order from IPR -- it's worth noting here that I live in Canada.  I was just about to go out of town, so I left instructions to put my roommate's name on it, so that if I was away he could pick it up. October 1, I got the email telling me that it had shipped, and as I was just about out the door, I'm glad I had taken the extra step.<br/><br/>But it never arrived. Days passed, then weeks. Sometimes, packages are dropped off with the building manager (rather than the usual practice of leaving a little door-hanger saying that a parcel was available at the local post office for pickup), so I began a weekly ritual of stopping in the office to check.<br/><br/>November arrived, and I became concerned. I emailed IPR and asked for help. I got a near-immediate response, wherein Fred Hicks and his shipping guy, Jason, said the package hadn't bounced on their end, and to keep waiting, so wait I did. IPR continued to be helpful and friendly. December came, and the holiday rush began. Still no sign of my books. Around December 8, IPR lets me know that the package had been returned undelivered, and take steps to send it back out. Yesterday, I receive notification of delivery and today I pick up. Everything's there, still in great condition.<br/><br/>What have I learned from this?<br/><br/>1) The gents at IPR are really great and know a thing or two about customer service;<br/>2) The USPS priority international shipping doesn't come with a tracking number. This is problematic (and slightly confusing; the equivalent package from Canada Post has one, and it makes life MUCH easier);<br/>3) Had I shipped the box to my office, it would've been there for me to pick-up the first time.<br/><br/>What does this do for my plans for the future?<br/><br/>1) Well, my FLGS is getting better about carrying small-press games, so I may end up sticking to that a bit more;<br/>2) I'm going to do some calculation of international courier rates; the cross-border brokerage fee can be really killer, but it's super-quick and the package can be tracked;<br/>3) I might just have to start shipping everything to the office, at least so long as I still use that office.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
