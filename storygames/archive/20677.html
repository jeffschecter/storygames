When you're unconscious for 1d4 hours, or when you're lost for 1d6 hours, or for how long it takes for hirelings to come to the hamlet.<br/><br/>Those rules are fast and work well but I was curious just for curiosity's sake how to figure out a cumulative probability so you could make a mechanic where you rolled every hour to see if you woke up.<br/><br/>I headed down a couple of wrong trails early on but what I ended up with was simple.<br/><br/>Let's say you have to wait/sleep/walk for X hours/days/weeks, where X is some die size like 1d6. The good old example of sleeping for 1d4 hours after getting hurt is one of these.<br/><br/>First, you've got to sleep at least one hour. What are your chances of waking up right after it? It's 1/4, or 1/X in the more general case. If you fail that wake up roll and sleep more, the next chance is 1/3, or 1/(X-1). If you fail that, and sleep more, it's 1/2 chance of waking up, or 1/(x-2) in the general case. You keep going until you get to a 1/1 chance, in which case you obviously don't roll.<br/><br/>To me it's completely unintuitive that this should work, that this should give the same probs. But it does work. I simplified it backwards from a bigger equation with summed series etc, then double checked:<br/><br/>Chance of waking up in the first of 1d4 hours: 1/4 or 25%.<br/>Chance of waking up in the second of 1d4 hours: 3/4\xd71/3, or 25%.<br/>Chance of waking up in the third of 1d4 hours: 3/4\xd72/3\xd71/2, or 25%.<br/>Chance of waking up in the fourth of 1d4 hours: 3/4\xd72/3\xd71/2\xd71, or 25%.<br/><br/>The same principle works for 1d6 hours, 1d12 days or whatever.<br/>It looks bloody obvious to me now that I've spelled it out like this and I'm probably gonna get a lot of "Well, duh..." but my first intuitions of how a mechanic like this would look were quite far from working out and it was third times the charm as I finally worked it out and then I reordered it and got it in this order and was like "Ok, yeah, then duh... now that I see this..."<br/><img alt="image" src="http://idiomdrottning.org/cumulative-awakening.png"/><br/><br/>So in practice for sleeping 1d4 hours:<br/>1. Sleep through the first hour, then:<br/>2. Roll 10+ on 1d12 to wake up, otherwise sleep through the second hour and:<br/>3. Roll 9+ on 1d12 to wake up, otherwise sleep through the third hour and:<br/>3. Roll 7+ on 1d12 to wake up, otherwise sleep through the fourth hour and then you wake up.<br/><br/>For 1d4+1 minute, just go through an extra minute before you start.<br/><br/>For being lost for 1d6 hours:<br/>1. Wander around for the first hour, then:<br/>2. Roll 11+ on 1d12 to get a new chance to roll Survival, otherwise wander around for another hour and:<br/>3. Roll 11+ on 1d12 but rerolling ones and twos until you get a non 1 or 2 result) to get a new chance to roll Survival, otherwise wander around for another hour and:<br/>4. Roll 10+ on 1d12 (no rerolls this time) to get a new chance to roll Survival, otherwise wander around for another hour and:<br/>5. Roll 9+ on 1d12 (no rerolls) to get a new chance to roll Survival, otherwise wander around for another hour and:<br/>6. Roll 7+ on 1d12 (etc) to get a new chance to roll Survival, otherwise wander around for another hour and then you'e get a new chance to roll Survival.<br/><br/>(It's pretty much 1d6, 1d5, 1d4, 1d3, 1d2 and then a sure thing.)                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453936/#Comment_453936" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T16:47:28+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  4:47PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting mathematically, but here's what comes to mind for me:<br/><br/>How important are those exact probabilities?

I doubt other bits of math are based on them, like damage in combat or hit point pools.<br/><br/>Wouldn't it be easier to say something like:<br/><br/>To recover from an effect, make [this kind of roll]. <br/><br/>The effect determines:<br/><br/>* How hard it is to recover. (Either a DC/difficulty, or a penalty to the roll.)<br/>* How often you get to make the check.<br/>* A cumulative bonus each time you roll.<br/><br/>So, for a 1d4-hours-type effect, you'd start with a difficulty that gives you a roughly 25% chance of success. You'd roll after every hour, and the cumulative bonus would be such that after three hours you'd have no chance of failure (perhaps +5/hour, if this was a d20 thing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453941/#Comment_453941" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T18:41:44+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  6:41PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Intuitive way to see the 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 1/1 thing: You will wake either on hour 1, 2, 3, or 4. Color the "wake" chip red, the others white, throw into hat. Pull one chip each hour. If red, wake. Hour 1: 1/4 chance.

You guys didn't see the work in progress versions!<br/><br/>For example, to wake up after the second hour in my first tentative versions required you to both pass one 3/8 along with passing one of two chances at a 2/3.\n<blockquote>You will wake either on hour 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We now know that these four separate chip pulls give the same probs as the 1d4 hours thing. And now it feels kinda "well, of course" and hard to even doubt it. But...

For 1d4 hours you only have about 9% chance of sleeeping the full four hours instead of the desired 25%.<br/>Here are the percentages hour by hour.<br/>25%, 38%, 28%, 9%<br/>I wanted 25%, 25%, 25%, 25%.<br/><br/>For 1d6 hours (being lost), you only have 2% chance of being lost for the full six hours instead of the desired 17%.<br/>17%, 28%, 28%, 19%, 8%, 2%.<br/><br/>For 1d12 hours (encounter since sunup), it looks like this:<br/>8%, 15%, 19%, 19%, 16%, 11%, 6%, 3%, 1%, 0%, 0%, 0%.<br/><br/>This method was actually one of the first I looked at before I started doing the work; I saw that it wouldn't work and it was one of the brain bugs I had that made it more of a challenge to find a method that did have the right probabilties.<br/><br/>A more succint statement of my method is:<br/>The sleeping hours are numbered starting with 0. Every hour, roll 1d4. If you roll a 4 you wake up. If you roll an hour-number you've aready rolled for, reroll.<br/>You'll get in effect 1d4, 1d3, 1d2, and 1d1, and you'll have the desired 25%, 25%, 25%, 25%.<br/><br/>That creates a lot of rerolls, though.<br/><br/>Paul, your 25%, 38%, 28%, 9% method was the second one I looked at. The very first was to roll 1d4 with target number 1 every hour. That gives 25%, 19%, 14%, 42% which isn't good either.<br/>It gives a very high emphasis on the last hour, like with the 1d12 example it gives 8%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 6%, 5%, 5%, 5%, 4%, 4%, 3%, 38%.<br/><br/>(I didn't actually calculate these two methods out fully until today: I was in bed away from the computer, I just had a simple calculator so I just did one hour, like I saw that the fourth hour in my first method was \xbe\xd7\xbe\xd7\xbe (which the calculator said about 42%) and I saw that the second hour in my second method (your suggestion here) was \xbe\xd7\xbd, which I could see without calculator that it wasn't 25%.<br/><br/>I came to the "right" method in a very convoluted way. I was working on bisecting the hours. Like "OK. My chance of waking up in the first hour is \xbc, I know that. But my chance of waking in the first half of complete 4-hour period, that's \xbd. And my chance of waking in the second, last hour of that first half, that's \xbd\xd7\xbd, but I need to incorporate the \xbc somehow... I think at one point I was looking having you to both pass one \u215c along with passing one of two chances at a \u2154.<br/><br/>I also looked at a couple of bag pulling methods... that lead me down a better track.<br/><br/>Then I came up with a sort of tree, with four branches. The left most branch had 25% chance, and then on the next tier, the leftmost branch had 33% chance, and then on the next tier, the leftmost branch had 50% chance. And that was the method I went with, expressed in a bunch of different ways. We use the +10, +9, +7 on a d12 method in play yesterday, worked great.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453958/#Comment_453958" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-19T14:12:24+00:00" title="June 19, 2016  2:12PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed on all points!
