But what about when you're being berated by a superior officer.  Once you get to "Dead", is that PC out of the game?  Even if that wasn't the NPC's goal?<br/><br/>On a related note, what about a "fist fight" between Troopers for (lowercase) dominance?  If the PC wins, is the NPC dead?<br/><br/>I hope that I've made my question clear.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for any suggestions/advice. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167441/#Comment_167441" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-06T15:52:00+00:00" title="September  6, 2008  3:52PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My understanding is that either side can "give" at any point in an NFA attack.

You can keep arguing, and with a little dice luck, you just might still win, but if your opponent succeeds in one more roll, your character is broken, for good. So are you going to give, or risk it all?<br/><br/>Personally, I like the former interpretation. Plus, it means you can get insulted by your commanding officers so hardcore that you lose all self-confidence, quit your job, and join the Ship Maintenance Crew, which is full of bitter and broken ex-Troopers just like you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_167523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167523/#Comment_167523" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T11:08:40+00:00" title="September  7, 2008 11:08AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ben: problem with this is it makes a shouting match quite like a shooting match, so why risk using NFA if your FA is higher?

They have either been mangled, shot up, disintegrated, lost their mind, had a nervous breakdown of the most severe kind or become some sort of hollow automaton. In any case, they are no longer playable.<br/><br/>To avoid this, you can work out an agreeable solution in the talking at the table ("Sure, I do what he tells me to do...", or "I agree to do it but I don't do it very well...", or "I stand up to him and the whole squad backs me up too, so he backs down..."), you can use a Strength or Weakness (letting you win or lose on your terms), or you can roll dice for it, knowing that someone will get broken by the outcome, and hope to win.<br/><br/>I'm wary, personally, of re-negotiating once I see what the dice have rolled, since that seems a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too kind of thing. That's when you spend Flashbacks.<br/><br/>Oh, for clarity, after an Encounter (where Threat Tokens are used) you recover from all E damage.

I assume even this is overridden by the "Lasting Wounds" special ability. At least, I hope so, since the planet I ran last time at SGBoston featured Mineral Creatures made of glass and lightning doing E-damage exclusively combined with Lasting Wounds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167925/#Comment_167925" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T07:34:38+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  7:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah.
