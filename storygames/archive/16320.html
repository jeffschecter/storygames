Already two of our playtesters have expressed an interest in either running and/or writing new scenarios, with new opportunities for those pesky delinquent aliens to annoy the Dean and tie up the already over-stretched Terran Watch. That means more stuff for Drunzi to steal, more electronic equipment for Zlith to fiddle with, and a host of powerful new sights, sounds and aromas to overwhelm Harok's super senses. Mind you, he's so ston- I mean, slightly, er, not all there most of the time, so it probably won't make much difference to him. So guys, join the party! The Alien House party, where, to quote Madness' Our House, 'There's always something happening and it's usually very loud'. Oh, and from the latest playtest, Kraag, the heavy lifting guy, got really angry at the unmanly pap pop that the juke box was pumping out so he aimed a punch at it, but rolled about 6DPs and so ended up destroying it completely, at which one of the other players gasped 'He's crushed Celine Dion!'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373915/#Comment_373915" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-21T01:20:37+00:00" title="April 21, 2012  1:20AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2012 9:55AM by catty_big.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            timonkeyI glanced at the PDF to see what the game was about, and I really dislike your foreword.  You say I bet you wonder what this game is about.  Too bad, I'm going to tell you what a roleplaying game is first!  Then I had to guess how much down the page I should scan to what the game is about.  Ultimately, I don't think I'm currently interested in it, but this did color my opinion and give me less patience in listening to your pitch.  Basically, you had one sentence instead of one paragraph before I said "I'm done".<br/><br/>Hi Tim, thanks for your comments.<br/><br/>Yes, apologies for that. I did in fact look at the foreword again almost as soon as I had written it and thought, This is going to annoy a lot of people, so I took out that bit about what is roleplaying etc. Basically that was me being a bit self-indulgent. Ok, very self-indulgent. I'm quite new to this and have learnt from several mistakes already (hence the current doc being v1.3). Now you can see what the game is about at the beginning of paragraph two, or the fourth line of the foreword.<br/><br/>Please forgive this idiocy and take another look at it. If you're not interested yourself then you might know someone who you think would be. It really is a fun game.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/>Leo<br/><br/>P.S. I'll check out your blog when I've got a sec. And good luck with your own game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377296/#Comment_377296" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T09:44:38+00:00" title="May  9, 2012  9:44AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2012 5:12AM by catty_big.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/sci-fi-beta-kappa" rel="nofollow">Latest version</a> up, now with detailed GM's notes, including a list of NPCs and guidance on running different types of scenarios.<br/><br/>Some playtesters' comments <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/44973653/SFBKPC.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379283/#Comment_379283" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T12:29:43+00:00" title="May 22, 2012 12:29PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2012 6:41PM by catty_big.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now with added chargen walk-through (pp12/13).
