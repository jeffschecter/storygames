Talk about stubborn. But the following thread is only historical, the good system is here: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21615/5e-tapping-to-keep-track-of-action-econ/p1" rel="nofollow">5e "tapping" to keep track of action econ</a><br/><br/>So the primary (of several) reasons why I don\u2019t like to MC games that are Powered by the Apocalypse such as Dungeon World is that I found that I really missed the initative order. Without it, the game is more like a group conversation i.e. <em>super difficult</em>. With it, there\u2019s a clear order that\u2019s easy to follow.<br/><br/>But, I was rereading some DW play examples and they really highlight something I value \u2014 seamlessness between the standard combat actions (\u201cattack\u201d, \u201cdodge\u201d etc) and new, weird, on-the-fly actions.<br/>I\u2019ve seen some of this seamlessness in 5e already, with some monsters chasing part of the party while the thief hid in the water, or characters climbing up bridges, and doing other weird things (which the game mechanically rewards with advantage).<br/>But I want to kick it up.<br/><br/>As I\u2019ve mentioned, I currently keep track of the initiative order with a little piece of paper with 30 lines (descending), noting the first initial of each participant as their rolls come in.<br/><br/>So the idea I got was to ask for init rolls on a need-to-use basic, adding participants into the initative order one by one. Roll your init to join the fray.<br/>And also, to the best of my knowledge, init is equal to dex at all times.<br/>And also, in the RAW, you roll init before you roll for the surprise round even though init is meaningless in the first round if there is surprise. I\u2019m thinking of changing that.<br/><br/>I haven\u2019t thought this through yet, or tested it. I have a game tonight, but let me start by writing up some hypothetical exchanges.<br/><br/>Before: \u201cI shoot the wumpus.\u201d \u201cOK, everone roll for initative.\u201d This enters \u201cinitative mode\u201d and is a very clear line between it and \u201cstory mode\u201d.<br/><br/>Now: \u201cI shoot the wumpus.\u201d \u201cOK, roll dex first to see if you\u2019re fast enough, it\u2019s coming at you\u201d, and I\u2019ll add the W and the shooter\u2019s first initial to my 30-lines as they both roll. \u201cI want to get in there with my shield\u201d \u2014 \u201cHow fast? Dex roll.\u201d \u201c13\u201d \u201cThe wumpus is too quick, it mauls the shooter with\u201d ...roll, roll... \u201cit\u2019s teeth! Take 11 damage as you struggle with it, and it tries to sink it\u2019s claws in you but your armor has that covered\u201d. \u201cNow, shooter, you\u2019re tangled up with the wumpus, what do you do?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m too close to shoot now, I use my sword and take a swing at it!\u201d \u201cOK, roll for it! It\u2019s AC is 15\u201d ...roll, roll... \u201cIt takes 8 damage\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s barely broken out a sweat. OK, shieldy, it\u2019s over there, biting into your shooter pal. What do you do?\u201d<br/><br/>Another (obvious) example: \u201cWe both reach for that sword.\u201d \u201cOK, both roll dex to see who\u2019s fastest\u201d and the rolls will be their positions in the 30-lines.<br/><br/>Oh, man... I\u2019m not sold on the idea yet, it could be the worst ever (in that it would have the lack of clarity of DW and all the hassle of rolling and tracking of 5e). But I think I\u2019ll try it out tonight!<br/>Thoughts?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438939/#Comment_438939" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-03T04:43:08+00:00" title="October  3, 2014  4:43AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The kind of "lack of clarity" found in AW is more of a feature than a bug, to me.

As you say, you need a real free-and-clear mode before it, and I\u2019m not sold on that protocol of play (I know it more from TSOY than from Edward\u2019s games) yet.<br/><br/>If I just use the schedule in secret (not that I think you\u2019re suggesting that), to help me GM in a more DW style but still getting a good sense of time and order, I would come across as arbitrary and I wouldn\u2019t have the RAW to fall back on.<br/>If I go instead with \u201croll dex as you join the fray\u201d-initiative, I\u2019m sticking somewhat close to the RAW (just skipping one step in the combat order).<br/>Hmm, this is a curious issue.

Like a ritual phrase, \u201croll for initiative\u201d. Every number that people report I place on a little chart, the \u201cinitiative order\u201d.<br/><br/>Here, instead of a formal \u201clet\u2019s go around the table, what did everyone roll\u201d, the rolls would come in more piecemeal as people entered the fray (or fled from it, or did something else).<br/><br/>So let\u2019s say in the normal game, we\u2019d be in story mode, and then boom, a fight, let\u2019s enter initative mode, everyone rolls as normal and it\u2019s<br/><br/>Wumpus: 17.<br/>Shooter: 15.<br/>Shieldy: 13.<br/><br/>The wumpus would go first and then the shooter and then the shieldy.<br/>I want to mix it up, tangle everything up. (The purpose and goal of this is to encourage action beyond the standard \u201cattack\u201d, \u201cdodge\u201d, \u201cdash\u201d, \u201cdisengage\u201d etc, and instead see more weird things like climbing trees, grappling etc.)<br/><br/>So in the \u201centering the fray\u201d-game, we\u2019re in story mode. Suddenly I find the need to have some initative order (because fighty stuff is going on). Let\u2019s say someone is aiming their bow at the wumpus, I want to know if they\u2019re fast enough because this creature is wildly angry at this party.<br/>The two roll it off in a dex context but I save the results on the initative tracker, let\u2019s say they roll a 17 and a 15:<br/><br/>Wumpus: 17.<br/>Shooter: 15.<br/>When Shieldy wants to enter the fray, they\u2019ll roll another dex roll and we know which combatants they can go before, and which they have to go after. Let\u2019s say shieldy rolls a 13, and isn\u2019t in time to stop the wumpus from running up to the shooter and engaging in melee.<br/><br/>We\u2019ll have<br/>Wumpus: 17.<br/>Shooter: 15.<br/>Shieldy: 13.<br/>and we\u2019ll stick to that for the rest of this fight which will hopefully be short. The idea is that there\u2019s less of a transition from \u201cstory mode\u201d to \u201cinitative mode\u201d. I can go less \u201cOK shieldy, it\u2019s your turn\u201d and more \u201cthis is what\u2019s going on, shieldy, what do you do!\u201d<br/><br/>Another example, let\u2019s say that shieldy would\u2019ve won:<br/>Shieldy: 18.<br/>Wumpus: 17.<br/>Shooter: 15.<br/><br/>Shooter starts aiming at the wumpus but the wumpus is faster (dex contest) and starts fighting the shooter. Shieldy wants to enter the fray, rolls dex and gets 18, and is alert enough to do something before wumpus has the chance to even move.<br/>Now I have all three numbers and can stick to that, but in the same \u201cwhat do you do\u201d-fashion as before. Translating all the actions to 5e rules rather than DW moves, and, importantly for me, having an order.<br/><br/><br/>That\u2019s the goal. I\u2019m not at all convinced that it\u2019ll work, I might be setting myself up to fail here, but I kind of want to give it a go.<br/><br/>Even <em>with</em> the initative rules of \u201cthe normal game\u201d, the comment I got from some new-to-roleplaying players after our second session was that there had been a lot of action, this was when they had been chased by bugbears and goblins and hid in the water etc etc. I love this and want to kick it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438946/#Comment_438946" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-03T06:17:08+00:00" title="October  3, 2014  6:17AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's say shieldy didn't want to enter the fray until after the wumpus attack (so as to prevent himself from becoming a target, perhaps).<br/><br/>Then he rolls an 18.

But maybe it won't feel so bad, or you'll figure out a way to make it more interesting (e.g. your action declaration affects your odds of success, or your initiative roll - so maybe declaring an attack is more dangerous, because, if you lose initiative, you don't have your defenses ready, or something like that).<br/><br/>Other models I like for initiative:<br/><br/>* Free-and-clear<br/><br/>The idea is that everyone declares their actions all at the same time, and only then we play through the action and see how it turns out. This can be exciting and chaotic.<br/><br/>You can handle it one of three-four ways:<br/><br/>- Assume that all actions are simultaneous. (So, for instance, two opponents can kill each other on the same round if both hit.) If two actions should contradict each other, whichever action rolls a better result takes precedence. (e.g., If you are trying to shoot Bob, and I'm trying to step in the way and block the shot, we compare my defense roll and your attack roll, and whoever rolls higher gets their way. If we're both trying to kill a monster, whoever's attack roll is better hits first, etc.)<br/><br/>- The AW way (Vincent says AW is a conversation, but in some of his combat examples, he goes "round-by-round", with everyone declaring actions, and then the MC resolves them in whatever order seems most reasonable or most interesting). So, basically, just GM's call, in logical order according to the fiction or whatever seems most interesting dramatically.<br/><br/>- Everyone declares at once, and we resolves in whatever order we like, but we use Dex rolls (or whatever) to handle any actions which are time-sensitive (like two people trying to grab something at the same time).<br/><br/>- The Sorcerer way: everyone declares at once, and *then* we roll to see which order the actions take place in. (In Sorcerer, you just roll once, and that determines how fast AND how well you carry out your action, so success and initiative are based on the same roll.) This can be fun, especially if you declare that you're going to launch a fireball at the door, but in the meantime a monster pushes your friend in front of the door, and you hit them instead.<br/><br/>* The Marvel way<br/><br/>Here, we find some way to determine the first person to start, and then that person chooses who goes next. A little meta, in a sense, which could bother some D&amp;D players, but simple and works really well. Good for strategic players, who can try to pull off convoluted plans more easily (compared to, say, the chaos of the Sorcerer method).<br/><br/>* The players go first, always.<br/><br/>This is the old D&amp;D method, and it works surprisingly well. It basically feels like AW/DW: the GM announces what the opposition is doing, and then says, "what do you do?" Then we resolve the players' actions.<br/><br/>* Reverse declaration and initiative<br/><br/>Everyone rolls initiative, then declares actions in *reverse order*. The worst initiative has to declare what they're doing first, before they know what anyone else is doing. Then, resolve actions in initiative order. So the best initiative gets to hear what everyone else is doing and THEN choose their action and pull it off first.<br/><br/>Makes initiative really, really valuable.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438964/#Comment_438964" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-03T13:24:35+00:00" title="October  3, 2014  1:24PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have super lot of time to write right now (will write more soon) but the test, as tests go, was a failure.

The winner "has the initiative" for a number of rounds equal to the difference between the two rolls. <br/><br/>Especially interesting if a) you extend your interpretation of "initiative" to things beyond simply who-goes-first, and b) you come up with a fun rule for ties. (I use a players' choice, choosing between first action and careful positioning.)<br/><br/>Another way to run initiative in B/X D&amp;D:<br/><br/>The group assigns a leader/caller. That person's initiative stands for the whole group. However, particularly fast characters can use their personal roll, instead.<br/><br/>This allows an unusually fast character a chance to always act first, even if "his side" is losing the initiative.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438976/#Comment_438976" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-04T01:28:35+00:00" title="October  4, 2014  1:28AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One important piece of data I'm lacking is: how many rounds does a fight typically last, on average, in your 5E games?<br/><br/>I have not yet checked out the 5E book(s) and, despite brief excursions into 4E and various flavors of OD&amp;D, I haven't been involved with a long, continued D&amp;D campaign since 3E/3.5E. The way 3E used to manage initiative (fixed on the 1st round for all subsequent rounds, declare-and-act on your turn, do nothing outside your turn except AoOs, etc.), then inherited by 4E (and apparently by 5E as well?) was predicated on battles lasting a large number of rounds, so that mixing things up each new round would have been a hassle. I remember battles taking huge amounts of real time, as well, to be resolved: my usual group wasn't especially handy with rules or well-organized (OK, we were a mess), and it frequently took us a full 4-hrs session to resolve a big complex fight, plus some very little roleplay leading into it or dealing with the aftermath. I think the game played twice as fast with a very competent group, but I doubt it could ever be faster.<br/><br/>On the opposite side, violent scenes in my AW games were usually out very fast, as quick as firing a gun. Most battle-like situation lasted no longer than two, maybe three "rounds", counting by how many moves each player-character performed on average, with a "round" rarely taking more than a minute or two in real life. Some of the most tense, emotionally charged scenes of violence were resolved through a single move, plus maybe one help/interfere move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438978/#Comment_438978" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-04T04:24:45+00:00" title="October  4, 2014  4:24AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2014 4:25AM by 2097.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They're usually over before two complete rounds.<br/><br/>But I don't need to mix it up every round; once I as DM know the initiative order, I can use it to ask "what do you do?" to people in that order.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438985/#Comment_438985" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-04T06:25:03+00:00" title="October  4, 2014  6:25AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think my advice, if you want to forgo the normal strict initiative procedure, would be to go with a "players always go first" approach. not too unlike DW.

I'm still working on it, making more examples, playing it out in solo.<br/>I've immediately run into some pretty severe IIEE basics, particularly problematic when characters have multiple attacks and multiple opponents. Adam, I'm using some of your stuff frome "House Interpretations" about HP often representing tactical positioning, and misses and hits not meaning misses and hits.<br/><br/>Example fight: level 1 monk w quarterstaff vs 2 skeletons.<br/>Legend:<br/>[text in these means things thought or done]<br/>"Text in these means things said for purposes of fiction\u201d<br/>Plain text means things said for purposes of mechanics.<br/><br/>[As DM notices that the monk has entered a room about 25 feet from some skellies, she rolls their +dex, gets 16+2 = 18. Wow, they're on the ball. On line 18, she writes S.]<br/>\u201dThe two skeletons in the room start rushing toward you, armed with swords. What do you do?" Roll +dex to see if you're fast enough.<br/>[So far, the skellies are still 25 feet away. The monk player rolls, 9+3= 12.]<br/>12!<br/>[The GM jots down M on line 12, determine in her mind that the skellies move the 25 feet and enter melee, and rolls two d20 for the skeletons attacks. She knows the monks AC 16 and skellies' atk +4 means that they hit on 16-+4=12+. The rolls are 17 and 12, for two times five damage.]<br/>"The skeletons rush toward you and there's not much you can do. They find an opening and you feel their swords as it goes dark and you pass out." Take 10 hp loss, you had eight, right?<br/><br/><br/>[Ok, let's have a do-over. I'm writing (on the phone) as I'm rolling and doing this. Sometimes life in the dungeon is cruel and brief and we are so alone.<br/>This time, I rolled 16+2=18 again for the skellies. Coincidence. Jots down S on line 18.]<br/>"There are two skeletons in the room and they're pretty on the ball as they rush towards you" [but in my mind I haven't moved them yet, still 25 feet away] "what do you do?" Roll +dex to see if you've got time to react. [The monk player rolled 18+3=21]<br/>21! [GM jots down M on line 21.] "They're fast, but not as fast as you. What do you do?" "I rush up to them" [DM now knows they're in melee range and the monk has moved 25 feet] and, ok, staff on one, martial arts on the other, right? Staff: [14+5=19, a hit], martial arts [2+5=7, a miss]. Roll damage for the staff. Sure, [3+3=6], it's six. [DM knows it's bludgeoning so subtracts six twice. One skelly now has 1 hp, the other 13. Before the DM describes the results, she rolls their attacks: 1, and 19. One hit.]<br/>"The one you hit with the staff starts to wiggle, like it's programming is disturbed, damaged, but the other one doesn't falter and pressures you unrelentingly" Take a 5 hp loss. \u201dWhat do you do?" "I smash at the unhit one with my bo staff and put an elbow in the broken one." Ok, staff first: [18+5=23] it hits [since AC is open knowledge at the table], and the elbow: [9+5=14] also hits. I'll roll damage. [4+3=7 with the staff, 3+3=6 with the martial arts]. That's six on the broken one, seven on the other. [The DM doubles the seven for the bludgeoning vulnerability, and it's enough.] "They both collapse, broken and smashed."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439096/#Comment_439096" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T10:50:49+00:00" title="October  6, 2014 10:50AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there are many problems and pitfalls with this, spots where it could be faster or more accountable or easier to learn and follow.

That's the first action of the second round -- initative isn't rerolled.<br/>To clarify, what's going on in that second \u201ddo over\u201d fight is: both roll initative (which equals dex). The order is: "monk, then skellies". This is noted on a piece of paper with 30 lines (descending), so that line has two letters on it: first the M on line 21 and then the S on line 18. The other lines are blank. (Ditching this whole paper writing, as has been suggested a few times, is still on absolutely on the table.)<br/>In the fight, the monk first makes two attacks. Both skellies survive that attack, so they make one attack roll each -- the missed attack roll narrated as if the hurt skeleton not being dangerous, the hit attack roll narrated as pressure, position and fatigue even though there was a 5 hp loss (as skeletons deal in the raw).<br/>The second round begins. The monk makes two attacks and both skeletons die.<br/><br/>In the first fight, the initative order was "skeletons, then monk" and the skeletons dropped the monk in their first attacks, never giving the monk a turn.<br/>So now you see that one of the most important design considerations I'm using is compatibility and isomorphism with the 5e RAW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439115/#Comment_439115" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T14:33:51+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  2:33PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean, I'm very satisified with all the one monk vs one skeleton, and one monk vs two skeleton, fights I've run on my own.

Or do you actually want to change the system in play to be looser?<br/><br/>It's also interesting that this system only affects the events of the first round - is that right? Afterwards, it's straight-up D&amp;D combat.<br/><br/>(I know that in OSR-style D&amp;D, one of the important features was the ability for one side to occasionally get two attacks in a row: like when there is surprise, and you win initiative as well, or when you lose initiative one round and then win it the next. This introduced even more uncertainty to combats, making it possible to get slaughtered in a surprise confrontation, even by otherwise "safe" opponents.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439121/#Comment_439121" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T15:23:29+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  3:23PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2014 3:27PM by 2097.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Surprise and initiative are both still there. In 5e, you only roll surprise when one or both sides is trying not to be seen, which is common in actual play but haven't featured in my monk/skeleton experiments yet because I know that that is one thing that the ETF system will handle very well. And yes, just like in the OSR, there will be two attacks in a row if one side can both win surprise and win the initiative.)<br/>Part of the confusion is that I sometimes narrate losing the initative as lack of alertness, not being on your feet etc even in the fights that have no surprise. The other part of the confusion is that surprise is also determined by dex in 5e, sort of.<br/><br/>Yes, these changes are meant to be cosmetic, but IIEE stuff and dice/cloud stuff still trip it up.<br/>So far, the changes from the RAW are:<br/>1. Initiative isn't rolled until after the surprise round. (In the RAW, after you determine surprise, you roll initative, then the surprised side do nothing the first round, even though they've recieved a place in the initiative order. In ETF, the surprising side take their turns any order they want during the surprise round, and if there's a second round, initiative can be rolled.)<br/>2. There's no "Everybody, roll for initiative". What there is instead is clear when there's only one player but I'm still working on this part for multiple players.<br/>3. Instead of Initiative, it's called Dex, they're the same anyway.<br/>4. Hits and misses are narrated differently (in "the cloud") but interact with the character sheet and dice as per RAW.<br/><br/>So yeah, it's to make it seem more fluid. Because it's already the best fights I've seen in an RPG and I want to kick it up and make the awesome more consistent. More water-hiding, tree-climbing.<br/>It also deliberatly tries to erase the "threshold" between "now we're not in initiative mode, we're just saying what we're doing" and "now we're playing the Combat Minigame, everyone take turns". Such thresholds or modality can be fruitful but I want to try this out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439123/#Comment_439123" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-06T15:43:46+00:00" title="October  6, 2014  3:43PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a question: in the first monk/skellies fight, the DM decides in her mind that the skeletons will move, engage, and attack with swords.

I'd say that describing the skeletons as holding swords in their hand counts as a declaration of intent. I you had described them as skeletons with bows and quivers of arrows, that would've been a different statement of intent. Even if they were carrying multiple weapons on them, the ones they've readied when they first appear count. When you want a monster to change to a different attack mode, say so ("one of them drops the sword and pulls out an arrow") or give a hint ("the dragon pulls its neck back and a red glow appears in its throat") right <i>before</i> rolling dice, as you commit to that plan.

Damage is not a separate diegetical step from the attack, so it would sorta break the flow to have to wait for the outcome of a second roll.<br/><br/>Players, I'd allow each one to do it however they like or, rather, however it comes more natural to them.

You're playing with publicly known AC, so I guess it's "I hit for X damage"/"I miss"\u2026 Or do you allow/demand more detailed bits of description, such as "I smash it right into its ugly nose with the pommel of my sword"?<br/><br/>I don't see what's wrong with your examples, really.

Thank you!<br/>So what have we got now, trying to codify some principles:<br/>\u201dThink of monsters with multiple attack types as having multiple modes. Changing mode doesn't cost an action but needs to be announced before the dice are rolled."<br/>Example: "They put away their swords and ready arrows. [roll, roll] Arrows hit the wall over your head, and they turn and run out from the room. What do you do?\u201d<br/><br/>"Never say 'miss' in melee. Attacks fail to cause HP loss because of the interaction between attacker and defender, not because attacker is goofy."<br/>Example: "They're still reeling from the punches you gave them, and you get a second to breathe. What do you do?"t<br/><br/>As for bracing for impact, you still need a dex (init) check, because if you can spend an action to do this, the skeletons would get Disadvantage. This mechanical interaction is called "Dodge" in the RAW.<br/>I see the dex/init rolls (which are made in the first round only) as a "can you react in time" sort of thing and am trying to find a place for them.<br/><br/>In this case: "I brace myself for impact" could be followed by "Ok, roll dex." which would result in either "Yeah, you're ready [and skeletons roll at Disadvantage]" or "You're fast, but they're faster."<br/>Which is a mixed blessing: the skellies roll normally but the monk gets to counterattack in the same round, not just spend the action dodging. Provided the monk survives\u2026<br/><br/>So are we landing on something like:<br/>"Ask for and recieve intent before asking for the init roll"?<br/>That sounds very fitting to what I originally intended for this ETF method.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439159/#Comment_439159" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-07T01:53:07+00:00" title="October  7, 2014  1:53AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, in "the cloud", Initiative feels kind of like surprise, and Surprise will be like another layer of surprise, "double surprise" almost.<br/><br/>So let's say the skeletons were hiding to ambush the monk.

But the numbers are the same as the crocodile and it doesn\u2019t have any extra vulnerabilities. The monk has a +3 dex, 8 HP, 16 AC. The fighter has a +4 dex, 13 HP, 15 AC.

Also: commentary from me.</em><br/><br/>DM: <strong>You see two skeletons,</strong> <em>the DM rolls 1d20+2 = 12 and enters S on line 12,</em> <strong>and something you have never seen before. It looks like a large woolly blob, but its fur is all covered in glittering frost.</strong> <em>The DM rolls 1d20+0 = 1, and puts down I on the first line.</em> <strong>The weird frost thing doesn\u2019t seem to move, but the skeletons are coming towards you with swords drawn. What do you do?</strong><br/><br/>Monk: <strong>Everyone loves bashing some skellies! I kick one after hitting the other one with my bo staff.</strong><br/><br/>DM: <strong>They\u2019re pretty fast,</strong> roll your dex.<br/><br/><em>Monk rolled 1d20+3 = 8. The DM noted M on the eight line.</em><br/><br/>DM: <strong>They\u2019re way faster than you, and they rush toward you. Fighter, what do you do?</strong><br/><br/>Fighter: <strong>I want to light one of my arrows on fire and shoot it into the weird blobby thing. I don\u2019t trust it.</strong><br/><br/>DM: <strong>With the skeletons going all choppy?</strong> Roll dex to see if you\u2019re fast enough.<br/><br/><em>Fighter rolled 1d20+4 = 7. DM noted F on the seventh line.</em><br/><br/>DM: <strong>These skeletons are relentless.</strong> <em>In the DM\u2019s mind, the skeletons move 20 feet, into melee range.

The DM knows skeletons hits the fighter\u2019s 15 AC on a 11+.</em> This one is on you, <em>the DM holds up the other die and looks at the monk, who will be hit on a 12+,</em> and this one is on you. <em>The DM rolled 1d20 = 10 and 1d20 = 3.</em> <strong>They\u2019re right up next to you, but you can dodge them.</strong> <em>The DM looks at her card. It reads, from top down, S M F I.

Everyone nods. The monk rolled 1d20+5 = 8, 1d20 + 5 = 18, 1d8 + 3 = 11 and 1d4+3 = 5 all in one go. The eleven was tied to the missing attack, but 5 go in.</em> What was their AC again?<br/><br/>DM: Only 13, <strong>they\u2019re just wearing scraps.</strong><br/><br/>Monk: OK, so the staff doesn\u2019t do anything, but my kick lands, five damage. <em>The DM marks 5 hp loss on one the skeleton.</em> Remember, they\u2019re sensitive to bludgeoning damage! <em>She marks off five more. (I often use a small soroban for monster HP, but you can use whatever. Spindown dice maybe, go stones, scrap paper.)</em><br/><br/>DM: <strong>Fighter, the skeletons are making it hard for you to get a clear shot in at the frost-furred blob.</strong> You\u2019ll get disadvantage, do you still want to do it? <em>This is according to \u201cRanged Attacks in Close Combat\u201d in the RAW.</em><br/><br/>Fighter: <strong>Yeah, I want it to burn!</strong> Or, wait, does it get cover, too?<br/><br/>DM: <strong>No, the skeletons are kinda to the side, sort between you two guys.</strong> <em>The DM figures this makes sense, she hadn\u2019t really decided that they were blocking or protecting the Ice Holder.</em><br/><br/>Fighter: <strong>OK, I\u2019ll make my shot.</strong> Any special rules for the flaming arrow?<br/><br/>DM: Naw, play it as a normal arrow but it changes the damage type. This thing has AC 12, <strong>it\u2019s naturally hardy with its weird fur, but it\u2019s not wearing anything special.</strong><br/><br/><em>The fighter rolled 1d20+6 = 10.</em><br/><br/>DM: Remember you had disadvantage... <em>The DM sees the die.</em> Oh, never mind.<br/><br/>Fighter: Yeah, it\u2019s already under.<br/><br/><em>The fighter marks one arrow lost from the equipment list.

They go crazy at you, fighter, and</strong> you lose 5 HP as <strong>you dodge their swords. Monk, you have a perfect opportunity, what do you do?</strong><br/><br/>Monk: <strong>I want to fight this furry thing! It seems pretty weak.</strong><br/><br/>DM: Sure, roll your attacks.<br/><br/><em>The monk rolled 1d20+5 = 11, 1d20+5 = 16, 1d8+3 = 7 and 1d4+3 = 7.</em><br/><br/>Monk: So, 12 AC, right? That\u2019s seven damage total, I think. <strong>I barrage it with a couple of hits from the staff, and a kick.</strong><br/><br/><em>The DM marks down 7 HP loss. The Ice Holder has still 12 left.</em><br/><br/>DM: <strong>Fighter, you see this thing squirming with agony as the song only grow more beautiful as it switches its melody to D mixolydian, centered around a few A minor and E minor arpeggios.</strong><br/><br/>Fighter: <strong>Kill it! I draw my sword and chop it!</strong> <em>The DM nods. The fighter rolls 1d20+6 = 16 and 1d6+4 = 6.</em> Six damage. <em>The DM notes it. The Ice Holder is down to 6.</em><br/><br/>DM: <strong>You feel your sword grow cold as your sword goes through it. Frost shimmers in the air as you slice it like you would slice air. It\u2019s only repeating a few tones now, over and over.</strong> <em>It\u2019s the Ice Holder\u2019s turn. The DM rolls for it, eyeing the fighter. 1d20 = 8. The DM just shrugs. The skeletons are up.</em> <strong>The skeletons!</strong> <em>The DM is really gunning for the fighter now. Why is she holding such a grudge?</em> <strong>They still have their attention on you, fighter!</strong> <em>The DM rolled 1d20 = 15 and 1d20 = 14. Ouch! Five times two, that's 10 damage total. The fighter has 3 left.</em> <strong>Their fast, choppy movements are hard to predict and they manage to wound you.</strong> Lose 10 HP. <strong>Monk, they have their back turned toward you. What do you do?</strong><br/><br/>Monk: Wait, this weird thing is down to six, right? But it doesn\u2019t seem to do anything, what\u2019s its to-hit bonus?<br/><br/>DM: Plus four.<br/><br/>Monk: And it seems like it\u2019s not as sensitive to bludgeoning damage as the skeletons.<br/><br/>DM: Right.<br/><br/>Monk: <strong>So I think I\u2019ll attack the skeletons, then. The staff in the unhurt one, and a quick elbow in the other one.</strong> <em>The monk rolled 1d20+5 = 23, 1d20+5 = 21, 1d8+3 = 8 and 1d4+3 = 6.</em><br/><br/><em>The DM looks over.</em><br/><br/>Monk: <strong>I guess they both die?</strong><br/><br/>DM: <strong>Yeah, they both collapse, bones broken. Fighter, what do you do?</strong><br/><br/>Fighter: <strong>I keep slicing at this weird thing.</strong> <em>The fighter rolls 1d20+6 = 21 and 1d6+4 = 7.</em> <strong>It dies, right?</strong><br/><br/>DM: <strong>It\u2019s like you\u2019re just chopping into a heap of snow, after a while.

Roll initiative first, and THEN declare. (This is the D&amp;D way.)<br/><br/>You could make this feel different by having some kind of key phrase to announce it: "I try to react faster than my opponent!" "Ok, roll Dex."<br/><br/>And only then do you say what you do. In other words, you've now attached a fictional action or trigger to the attempt to take the initiative.<br/><br/>The default case is that the opposition does something... but you, being a hero, can attempt to act faster, which requires a roll.<br/><br/>2. You declare and then roll, as you have it. But the declaration is *important* anyway. Don't throw it away once you roll the dice. In this case, you have to carry through with your announced action, or some such.<br/><br/>You could have both sides roll their actions at the same time, but apply the effects one-by-one, for example.<br/><br/>Or the declaration affects you in some other way: there's a penalty to choosing a different action, or some other reason it is important even if you lose initiative.<br/><br/>3. Have some version of free-and-clear, where everyone announces their actions, but the Dex roll determines the order in which things happen. (This is kind of the opposite of what you're looking for, but fun in other ways.)<br/><br/>4. Maybe another way would be to make it a choice: do you want to follow your reason, or your instincts? In one case, you get to roll and act first (or at least potentially act first); in the other, you cede initiative to your opponent, but maybe you derive some bonus from that, or you have a wider scope of available actions (this could be represented by receiving more information about the current situation from the GM, for instance - waiting and delaying your action allows you to act on better, more thorough information).<br/><br/>Of course, you may be perfectly happy with it as is, anyhow!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439259/#Comment_439259" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-08T22:41:54+00:00" title="October  8, 2014 10:41PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As it is, it feels like a downside or a punishment: you want to do something, but you're blocked by the dice.

What I'm picturing in my mind is that, assuming that 20 is an average movement rate per round, starting the encounter at a distance of 40 would change the picture considerably.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439262/#Comment_439262" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-09T04:53:55+00:00" title="October  9, 2014  4:53AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Ice holder's movement rate is 20 feet, the others here. ave between 25-35.<br/>I haven't really found a norm yet.

You roll init for the monsters, say they're rushing towards the PCs and ask the players "What do you do?"\u2026 Some scenarios don't require players to roll init for round 1 at all.<br/><br/>If the monk counter-charges the skeletons, then yes, we assume they'll meet somewhere mid-way and we need to know who hits faster. But it the monk says: "I'll fall back to the party and warn them" (I'm assuming there's a larger party of adventurers and these two were scouting ahead), then you don't need him/her to roll initiative: as long as his/her movement rate's equal to or greater than the skeletons, s/he auto-succeeds.<br/>And if the monk says "I take a defensive stance", then s/he's effectively preparing for an exchange to happen in the second round. I would probably rule s/he gets the benefits of the "dodge" action + initiative 1 point higher than the skeletons, without rolling at all (as per 3e "prepare an action", basically).<br/><br/>If the fighter says "I shoot an arrow at them", there's no need to roll for the fighter's initiative yet, unless the monk's counter-rushing the skeletons, in which case the timing of the arrow is relevant to how many skeleton-sword attacks the monk ends-up facing.<br/>Otherwise, don't roll initiative for the fighter yet: you'll think about it when you do the next round of what-do-you-dos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439268/#Comment_439268" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-09T08:09:32+00:00" title="October  9, 2014  8:09AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<em>It\u2019s time for the do-over fight!

That's exactly what I meant, and the scene with adventurers nailing a door shut to escape reminds me of a relatively recent attempt at an "old school" Mentzer/Moldvay D&amp;D game, when we did exactly the same (against kobolds\u2026 Though by the third time we performed this most effective tactic, it had stopped being funny).<br/><br/>The only weird thing for me, as "audience", was the fighter getting into arm range from all of the monsters and effectively administering first-aid undisturbed. This makes me think that RAW 5e probably <i>assumes</i> characters moving like chess-pieces on a grid and thus, "in the interest of playability", allows for all sorts of weird actions to be performed within a single round. But as soon as we stop looking at it like minis on a grid and we get more colorful with the door-nailing and tree-climbing, highly stylized and abstract actions such as "performing first-aid to stabilize a 0hp companion" may stand out as quite absurd.<br/><br/>That's just aesthetic sensibility, of course. To me, your "There are some bones on the floor here, too, two skulls. [\u2026] They rise up, as full skeletons, and rush towards you with swords drawn" sounds like a cool description, but I fully expect players to take advantage of the moments they take to "rise up" to attempt some kind of reaction. You make it sound more like a video-game cut-scene, which takes some time but is effectively instantaneous because the players are not allowed to input any controls meanwhile. This is a degree of stylization with, to me, clashes against the vivid action of an adventurer holding a door against charging monsters while another nails it shut. "First-aid" sounds like a similarly videogamey abstraction, and I'd rather alter the RAW (possibly in a more lenient way, making it unnecessary to "stabilize" PCs, unless a high rate of PC-death is what the table expects) than let it in the way of a "true to life", vivid depiction of scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439274/#Comment_439274" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-09T13:44:21+00:00" title="October  9, 2014  1:44PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had the same reaction as Rafu, but that's just a stylistic thing.<br/><br/>I'm more concerned by the way the fighter attacks the skeletons, and they hit back, and then you only establish which happened first afterwards. That seems a bit clunky.<br/><br/>It would be nice, as I suggested earlier, to tie initiative to either a) the character's rolled action, or b) another in-fiction choice or action.<br/><br/>Then you can say, for example, "The skeletons come towards you, swinging their swords", DW style, and the player's prerogative it to respond with [ritual phrase for usurping initiative], with a roll to see if it works.<br/><br/>It might be pretty cool if that involved an interesting choice (for instance, ceding initiative gives you a +1 AC or something) or if the player had to come up with some kind of in-fiction rationale for why they were going to act first.

It was just "I stabilize them", not "I desperately grab some moss and try to stop the bleeding"?<br/>It wasn't exactly undisturbed, the fighter did get attacked an extra round for it. In DW terms, it could've been Defy Danger (Wis), 7-9 you stabilize your monk buddy but get damaged. Here, there's no partial success, but an action economy: a chance to stabilize followed by a chance to lose hp. All the monsters happened to miss (a 13% chance, coupled with also succeeding on the stabilization and we're down to less than six percent that this would happen) that deserves "a 10+ result" in DW terms. Again, I roll randomly as I write.<br/>How could I improve on this without veering from the RAW?<br/>There is no grid, but there is an action economy.<br/><br/>2. They rise up<br/>But they did do inputs here: in one fight, they held the door shut (and waited for the skeletons to come there), in the other they shot them and attacked them. Remember that the bones were 40 feet away. Or am I missing something?<br/><br/>3. The fighter just grabbing the dice and rolling, not determining dex<br/>That was the biggest problem (not saying the other things aren't problematic).<br/>I don't know what to do there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439289/#Comment_439289" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-09T19:31:43+00:00" title="October  9, 2014  7:31PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Moldvay (via Labyrinth Lord) is probably my most played RPG. Our sessions had a lot of "tree climbing", running away, door nailing, ambushing, spreading glue on the floor and spamming color spray, etc. But once engaged in the fight itself, it often was just rolling the attacks quickly to see who died and who won. Often the skeletons died since they were all glued up and color sprayed.<br/>But it wasn't like Dungeon World where weird things would happen inside the fight. Once in DW I got turned into a fish in the middle of fighting kobolds in a burning building.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439290/#Comment_439290" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-09T19:58:27+00:00" title="October  9, 2014  7:58PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's because it's <em>not</em> on a grid that you get more generous turns in 5e than in 3e. You can attack in the middle of your move, you can do things that previously triggered opportunity attacks\u2026 all of which would've required special feats or powers in 3e and 4e. Those games had restricted and complicated rules as a default, and "as special powers" made exceptions to those rules.

Not that it wouldn't work, but I think "rolling to see if you're faster" can be exciting, and not a stretch in a game where a single "attack" action can already take multiple rolls to adjudicate (to hit, for damage, plus any special complications).<br/><br/>But, to take a step back: my whole issue with the stabilize action was that whatever I can picture in my mind (basically, bandaging a bleeding wound) both takes longer than one round of swordplay and is obviously impossible to do while dodging swings. Thus, if it was on me to make the rules, in the same "gritty" world where you nail shut a door to escape monsters I'd rule that you can't successfully stabilize if you're being attacked, at all \u2014 doing so looks like a trick a character defined as a combat-medic would perform in a game of anime-show-like superheroism, same game in which the swordsman cuts arrows in half and deflects bullets.<br/>But, as I said, that's my aesthetic concern only: I would change the rules to reflect that, you absolutely don't need to do so and by RAW it was the only right thing to do.<br/><br/>As for the bones rising up, what triggered my concern is probably just that you went "\u2026and the skeletons come charging at you with swords. What do you do?" instead of stopping at "The bones rise up and are shaping into animated skeletons. What do you do?". Where, again, you did the correct RAW thing with some extra color added, while I'm instinctively advocating for changing the rules to make them better adhere to the fiction. Sorry.<br/><br/>As for the issue with the fighter's initiative roll, which <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> brought up, I noticed but that didn't bother me at all, and here's why. That sort of thing is going to happen around the actual table a lot, and you have to deal with it. The player rolled to hit already, you don't know their initiative yet, so what? Of course, asking for a retroactive initiative roll looked to me like the right thing to do. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439302/#Comment_439302" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-10T03:30:26+00:00" title="October 10, 2014  3:30AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Static monster hitpoints and damage made me strip away a lot of clever and quick shortcuts I had came up with over the years and the game was better for it.

Everyone acts at the same time.<br/><br/>Rolls determine if your character's action (not intent) is successful or not.<br/><br/>I apply modifiers to the rolls based on what the characters are doing.  For example: If someone is shooting at you and you decide to duck or run behind a corner, you apply some penalty dice to the attacker's roll.<br/><br/>The way it works is like this:<br/><br/>A player (usually the DM) declares an action for a character.<br/>The player of the character targeted by that action declares a response; that same player declares an active action.  (This is more of a table/person thing than anything else.)<br/>Repeat until all actions are made.<br/>Anyone can change actions until everyone's good with what their characters are doing.<br/>Modifiers are applied.<br/>Rolls are made.<br/>Outcomes are determined.<br/><br/>"Who goes first" isn't important; what matters is who is successful.

I'm currently running D&amp;D 5e so that's what I'm working with.<br/>What are those "good parts"?<br/><br/>1. A sense of urgency and directness: "The golem is running towards you, axe in hand, and he comes closer -- what do you do?"<br/>2. A sense of "tactical infinity", anything is possible, not just seeing the world through an interface of predefined at-will attacks and canned actions. "I dive underneath the axe and go for the dam, trying to get to the water".<br/>3. Primarily to foster 1 &amp; 2 rather than for its own sake, but: a seamlessness, eroding the boundaries between "story mode" and "combat rounds", a directness. Describing the events in the shared fictional space as they happen, not before they would happen. This '3' is specifically what I haven't liked about "everyone first say what they want to do, then we resolve it". It introduces a dissonant time gap.<br/><br/>Now, such a two-step, "free and clear"-system isn't what you (Dave L) are proposing. If I understand it correctly, instead of divorcing the temporal aspects of actions (initiative) from the qualitative (hit or miss), you use the timing to inform the narration of failure/success of the to-hit. I.e. I already narrate successful to-hits as creating a tactical or positional advantage (especially when hp is still high) and failed to-hits as a positional stalemate or "evenly matched fighting" with i.e. mutually successful parries.<br/>It seems to me than the system you are proposing would work great.<br/>I see two (solvable) problems with it. One is that things like movement, diving into lakes etc often don't require any rolls in 5e. A lot of the "Defy Danger"-type actions fall into this category -- their success or failure is instead dependant on position in the initiative order. (The more I think about it, the more genius the six-statted Defy Danger from DW looks, and I realize that I want to codify practices for my self that closely match applications of Defy Danger while still hewing close to the D&amp;D raw.) But this doesn't seem like that big of a problem. Character A wants to get into the lake, Monster B wants to get a bash in with the axe before that. Just let (as you suggest) the monster's to-hit resolve that.<br/>Problem two might sound trivial, but it is that this system (I'll call it "temp-factor" for now) still doesn't give me a turn order for where to turn with my "What do you do?"-questions. I'd have to remember who have acted in a "round" and who hasn't.<br/><br/>That brings me to the "bad parts" of DW for me. It's initiative system reminds me of turn-taking in a very informal group conversation. Which is a very difficult thing. When I've run it, sometimes everyone in the group feel that I gave everyone else more spotlight. It can feel like your turn is never coming up.<br/><br/>Anyway\u2026 does it feel "indirect" to use your system, Dave? Is there a sense of temporal dissonance, like "I jump into the lake" "Actually\u2026 [record scratching sound] the golem got a few licks in before." Timing incogruence?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441052/#Comment_441052" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-28T20:24:08+00:00" title="December 28, 2014  8:24PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is where I am currently:<br/>I want to have a fixed, "eternal" initiative list to start with. 10 + dex.<br/>From there, I want to follow it, going across the table describing DW-like situations and going "What do you do?"<br/>I can mix it up occasionally, if a particular situation seems more urgent, but only when I feel confident enough in the current state of "information juggling" that I'll be sure to get around to asking everyone in the round. I also want to foster a seamlessness between rounds, instead of a sharp divide between one round ending and another beginning, which is also an argument against mixing it up too much.<br/><br/>Here are some of the "moves" (defined as "cloud talk with consequences in the dice talk") to be on the lookout for:<br/><b>Anything that obviously triggers a canned D&amp;D action.</b> For example, applying positional pressure by threatening or attempting physical harm with a weapon is already codified in the game as "making an attack" and causes a roll vs AC to happen. Similarly, I as DM rather than the players, need to be familiar with the other predefined actions such as dodging, helping, shoving, grappling etc.<br/><b>Anything that triggers a codified reaction.</b> This both means actual Reactions (such as getting a free swipe at someone moving away from you) as well as things like saving from a blast spell etc.<br/><b>Moving around.</b> This is tricky because it's so simple. "OK you do it" is unsatisfying after all that Defying Danger I was spoiled with in DW. There are a couple of different resolutions available. First of all, here is where 5e's simpler Opportunity Attack rules shine, they can be really evocative and give us that danger-defying feeling. But let's say it's a ranged situation. The elves are shooting arrows at you, what do you do? "I dive under the bridge!" In DW, it's a dex-based defy danger. In Dave L's system (as I understand it), the elves get a shot in against your AC -- if they miss, you dove quickly enough. In D&amp;D raw, it's up to the initiative order, maybe they can try to hit you, maybe not. I think the Dave system implies a lot more free attacks, making "disengage" meaningless and almost gives even ranged combatants opportunity attacks. Also it disincentivizes things other than attacking: if you're getting shot at anyway, why not just shoot back? It also means fewer opportunities to create Advantage or Disadvantage.<br/><br/>Here is where I previously suggested to have a dex contest for it (in the early rounds -- your roll in that contest also placed you on the initiative order for future rounds). My worked examples in this thread used this method. At the table, this proved confusing for one of my players. In the case of NPC shooter, PC jumper, it's clear enough, but not in the reversed situation since the player would be asked for <em>both</em> a dex roll and, if successful, also a to-hit roll. This confused him, he was all ready to make an attack roll and he was jarringly interrupted and asked for a dex roll.<br/><br/>Let's look at the "static initiative" solution to this. If the PC is later in the initiative round, it's fair to give the npc archer's a roll so it's isomorphic to Dave's system here (and no extra attack has been granted to them, making it isomorpdic to the RAW as well). In DW terms, it's a "DM-facing AC-targeting Defy Danger move" (a.k.a. a normal boring attack roll from an NPC).<br/>Or maybe I'll have the player make a dex save instead. (BTW, I kind of miss "AC saves". Your "AC save bonus" would be your current AC minus 12, and the DC would be the opponent's to-hit bonus plus ten. E.g. a +4 Goblin hits your AC 14 character on a ten or higher (55%) so your +2 AC save would save you from a DC 14 attack on a 12 or higher (45%). But I digress.)<br/><br/>What if the player is ahead in the init order? They'd just succeed with jumping in the water, perhaps this counts as a "dodge" towards the archers giving them a shot with disadvantage, or it just works ("the game fiction either triggering or not triggering a move. Sometimes, a player can just do something without rolling- attacking a helpless or unsuspecting enemy is a good example, so are common-sense situations like the one above." from a DW guide).<br/><br/><b>Be on the lookout for things that can be represented by "dodge" and "delay"</b>. Dodge and delay are both very good at coping with temporal wonkiness. Anything slightly defensive? Boom, instant disad to the opponent. Anything that can't be done Now now? Bam, they just set up a delay.<br/><br/>Anyway, I long to give this "static initiative" some table time.

It absolutely succeeds in the goal of making the transition between fighting and non-fighting more seamless and it has encouraged doing some more non-combat action, mixing things up, making it more narrative.<br/><br/>However, I've received consistent pushback from all the players. They don't like it. They want the "game-like", classic, roll for initiative, be in a turn order, is it my turn, what is going on style of 3e and 4e.<br/><br/>As a compromise, I've started using a bowl (I use an upturned lid) with various colored wooden discs for the players and white stones for the monsters. If you're inside the bowl, you haven't used your action that round yet. If you're outside, you have. As the last person acts, instead of removing them, I add the others back in. Since I'm still jazzing around with the turn order (according to what fits best diegetically), it's not always the same person that's last.<br/><br/>This has satisified the players; they no longer suspect that I give the monsters way too many actions (which I didn't), they have some insight in what's going on in my mind. I get the benefits of the system I've discussed in this thread but it's clear that "one action, one reaction, one bonus action and one movement per round" is enforced. I've used the bowl system for maybe half a dozen of sessions and it's working good so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445659/#Comment_445659" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-14T17:56:23+00:00" title="June 14, 2015  5:56PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds cool, Sandra.<br/><br/>How do you handle the "moving around" quandary from your earlier post?

(That campaign only had 2 players + DM.) For the Strahd fights (he ran away a lot) I used a system of playing cards (the PCs and henches were listed in static initiative order, and then Strahd drew a card 1-20 and added his initiative score and then that placed him inside the PC's list).<br/>I tried various methods like a cardboard circle with paper clips etc.<br/><br/>Then I took my big break from RPGs for six months. Then I ran a one-shot at a con, four players + DM (+ a fifth player joined after lunch).<br/><br/>I just had them sit in initiative score order and we went around the table as if it was a board game. Very static and stiff but we had some nice things: one player at one point got to take his turn in advance \u2014 he was trying to stop another PC from doing something that that PC's player had already changed his mind about and was OK with being stopped.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, for my next campaign I'm trying something new. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21104/kutulu-derived-initiative-system-for-d-d/p1" rel="nofollow">Detailed here, I'm calling it "Messy Initiative System"</a>; the design goal is the same (to have a static initiative list but make exceptions based on what happens to make it flow back and forth more like a conversation or like AW) but with the subjective "this makes sense in the fiction"-MTP stuff significantly reduced, by having a simple precedence list to follow.
