Jacobson</cite>Is there a difference here beyond semantics--cause I can't see it.</blockquote>\nOf course there is.  It's just not been clearly stated.  Just imagine there being a group character sheet in addition to the personal one you've got.  When you act as a member of the group, or multiple members of the group act together, you can use resources from that sheet.  When you perform actions as a group or accomplish group goals, the group sheet advances.  Individual XPs work the same as you would otherwise expect.  (I've actually got a semifunctional version of this going in the post-apocalyptic game I'm writing)<br/><br/>The best examples of this I can think of are from video games.  In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks you can perform actions that require both PCs (I can't remember if you specifically unlock more as you go or not).  In X-Men, Legends (I and II), where for using powers from different characters at the same time.  Marvel: Ultimate Alliance tracks how much you've done with a specific group of heroes and you have a reputation score based on how long you've worked together and what you've accomplished - I haven't played it much, so I don't know what impact this has.<br/><br/>Earthdawn did something like this, so you should check it out.  I remember there being a nifty group experience thing in there, but I never got to play with it very much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112434/#Comment_112434" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T13:35:14+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  1:35PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

The Group character sheet has its' own traits, merits, flaws, stats, etc. separate from the individuals. The players, together, build the group's statistics, and benefit mechanically from their cooperation. The comradery it builds is really exciting to watch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112543/#Comment_112543" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T16:22:03+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  4:22PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a little like the Team system in the <i>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</i> videogame (Xbox/PS2/360/PS3/Wii): in addition to being able to level up the characters you're playing with as you go along, you can spend points on the team: expanding its roster, buying advantages like faster XP gaining, and so on.<br/><br/>Expand the kind of team benefits that are available, and voila, you're sitting next door to what Jarrod was talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112553/#Comment_112553" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T16:46:28+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  4:46PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the fighty game I'm working on, one of my tenants is "Working Together is more successful than Working Separately."  While this isn't a reward system per se, the battle mechanics are set up so that helping others is a natural effect of the game.  Which is to say that I'm looking to reward working together by making the goal easier to achieve (or vice versa, if you want to look at it from a cup-half-empty perspective).  Or, rather, it's rewarding with a play experience rather than with character currency.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112555/#Comment_112555" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T16:48:36+00:00" title="December  6, 2007  4:48PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, I hadn't thought of working from the other side of the spectrum.

Perhaps it isn't accidental at all, but it certainly isn't given a lot of emphasis. This might be to allow the players the challenge of learning synergy themselves, for all I know. The only explicit use of synergy among different characters I've seen in D&amp;D is flanking. The explicitness of this mechanic makes it very often used, in my experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think, though my experience with this game has been largely frustrating and brief, that Burning Wheel may have some level of synergy amidst it's maneuvers, in that I believe one character can do something that sets up for another character to do another thing... Though I may be getting this confused with the things you can do to set yourself up. <br/>\n<br/>\nRiddle of Steel also had a few maneuvers which could be used cooperatively, though again I believe they weren't necessarily intended that way, as the game is largely meant to simulate one-on-one combats, rather than larger multiples fighting multiples battles. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd really like to see a game that makes this a larger part of play, explicitly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
