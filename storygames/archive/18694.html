You might have heard about it under the working title of '4thbreaker.'<br/><br/>Over the course of several years, I ran a 4th edition D&amp;D game, cumulating at about 25th or 26th level.  I intended to continue all the way to level 30, but general fatigue and frustration with some aspects of the system ended up on me putting the game on permanent hiatus.  There were some attempts at house-rules for a while to patch what I felt were the most egregious problems, but then I got to the point where I felt I might as well scrap the whole thing and work from square one.<br/><br/>Exploding Kingdoms takes the core of grid-based tactical combat, interesting powers, and flavorful, larger than life characters, and focuses on that.  The focus remains firmly on the tactical level of play, with attempts to make sure ones decisions are always interesting, and always fun.  For example, there's no attack rolls; if you attack, you do damage.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4hih248edv0qqtd/xkplaytestpacketv.4.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's the link to download.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419839/#Comment_419839" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T10:24:20+00:00" title="August  9, 2013 10:24AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks pretty cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
