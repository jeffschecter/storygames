So I printed out all the stash, and had some sessions with them.  I mentioned this in another thread, and Userclone DEMANDED an AP.  So here we are.  And here's the Wildlings thread:  http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12047<br/>\n<br/>\nSome very cool ideas came to the table, and I found the game brilliant for blending in any old fantastical fairy-tale idea that came into my head.  First, to get them into the groove of the game, I had them rescue a Viking from the clutches of a giant snake.  They rolled the head out of the trench and back to the camp, which was a gloriously silly thing to do, the sort of thing most adult roleplayers would never even think of doing.  It also allowed me to bring in some educational elements.  The head attracted carrion eaters, and they spent the rest of the in-game day hmm-ing and haa-ing over how to protect their trophy.  They ended up building a simple piled-stone wall, but that didn't help against birds of flight.  That gave me the idea of introducing a sort of \xfcber-vulture type as the main bad guy that kidnaps the kid.  So I found this pic here:<br/>\nhttp://paizo.com/image/content/CrimsonThrone/PZO9008-PestilenceDemon.jpg<br/>\nWhen the characters retired for the night, I told them they were awoken by a ruffling of feathers, and an unearthly shrieking.  They ran out of the camp in time to see the eeeebil bird-thing fly off, silhouetted against the moon, with the girl in its claws.  That's where we left off.  So far, so good!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363685/#Comment_363685" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T23:30:02+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 11:30PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!

I strongly recommend that you do not end a game-session with a PC captured or in a predicament.

Resolutions are inevitable and frequent, to suit both their over-active imaginations and short attention spans.  And I know the kids pretty well.  The captured girl is the one suggested by John Harper as a start-off quest.  I'll be starting the next session by asking the kids what their characters' relationships are to the girl, and how they feel about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn, I think the game is too elegantly bare-bones for any rough patches to be intrinsic in the mechanics.  At its current stage of development, I view it as a solid, intuitive foundation for GM creation and player cooperation.  Ation, ation.  And thankfully, I didn't run into any rough patches on account of my GMing either, although I didn't really prepare well enough to make good NPCs.  As is usual with my group of kids, most of our games are highly improvised, and based on sudden revelations of fantasy.  I can see the game working well for both improvised play and for more meticulously planned sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364015/#Comment_364015" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T16:19:31+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  4:19PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Joachim!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364034/#Comment_364034" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-29T17:13:21+00:00" title="February 29, 2012  5:13PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joachim--I am going to run this, like, next week, and then again for kids at Gamestorm.

Like, take a character's strongest spirit animal, and make a GIANT, ABOMINABLE version of that in an encounter.  Maybe they just slay it, like they did with the giant snake, or maybe something magical happens, if the character gets the idea of just talking to it or something.  Either way, one of my characters now has a giant snake head out of which he can build any sort of magical item to suit his spirit animal.  Play very much to their strengths, but encourage teamwork by putting aspects of each strength into the desired formula for overcoming each obstacle.<br/><br/>I didn't use marks, that will be next time I think.  But if you're playing it at Gamestorm, I would have at least two solid, three-dimensional NPCs ready, just as a marker for the others.  And have them do woodsy stuff, like building a fire and tanning hides over it, or making a flint spearhead, using a knuckle from the deer you just slew as a hammer-stone.

Especially foreign NPCs; culture clashes with the Viking guy I cooked up on the fly were very entertaining, and the kids had fun tackling the fact that he didn't speak their language.  A lot of funny sign language around the table, and good laughs.  And yes, simple and short.  Puzzle-like problems work very well.  For the next session, I'm planning on introducing 2 magical items, one a ring of silence and one a ring of invisibility, and the kids will have to get past or defeat the twin hatchlings of the eeeebil bird, one of them is blind and one is deaf.  Stuff like that really gives them a sense of reward when they grasp the idea and run with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_364264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364264/#Comment_364264" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T12:03:26+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 12:03PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rubbermancer</cite>I work in a kindergarten</blockquote>\nOh, also, I didn't pay attention to this: these kids are like 5, 6 years old?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rubbermancer" title="Rubbermancer"><img alt="Rubbermancer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rubbermancer">Rubbermancer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364273/#Comment_364273" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-01T12:18:07+00:00" title="March  1, 2012 12:18PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that they are.
