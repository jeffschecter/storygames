Most excitingly for us, there's no obvious "Story Games" candidate. We could easily back Sweet Agatha or Mouse Guard, but also Jeepform (it's always been an indie darling) or D&amp;D 4E (it's the focussed version of D&amp;D that some of us have wanted for a while). And I don't know enough about Dominion to comment.<br/><br/>This thread is for decisive people who can both decide a winner and give reasons for it. It is not for notorious fence-sitters like Jason Morningstar and Paul Czege. You won't see them on this thread, telling us definitively who should win. So don't be like those two. If you post, tell us who should win, and why.<br/><br/>So who should win and why?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221926/#Comment_221926" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T10:06:49+00:00" title="August  1, 2009 10:06AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet Agatha should win, it's a whole new gaming experience, brilliantly packaged and presented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221932/#Comment_221932" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T10:49:13+00:00" title="August  1, 2009 10:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have enough experience playing any of the games, but I have played Mouse Guard and it's still kept me excited about it.

The award was first made for the year 2000, and the first award ceremony was on August 4, 2001.<br/><br/><i>Why is this award different?</i><br/><br/>The Diana Jones Award is decided on merit, not popularity or commercial success. You may never have heard of some of the nominees, but you can be certain that they are all outstanding in their fields. What is more, because the winner is chosen by a closed, anonymous committee, it is impossible for a manufacturer or publisher to stuff the ballot or interfere with the voting.<br/><br/><i>What is \u2018Excellence in Gaming\u2019?</i><br/><br/>The Diana Jones Award is designed to reward any combination of achievement, innovation, and anything that has benefited or advanced the hobby and industry as a whole; or which has had the greatest positive effect on games and gaming; or which, in the opinion of the judging committee, shows or exemplifies gaming at its best.<br/><br/>The precise interpretation of \u2018excellence in gaming\u2019 is left to the discretion of the individual judges, who approach the subject from many different backgrounds and perspectives. Innovation, artistic merit, commercial success, cultural significance, longevity and several other factors are all considered.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221950/#Comment_221950" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T12:46:17+00:00" title="August  1, 2009 12:46PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mouse Guard.

I'm having trouble parsing what the "best demonstrated the quality of excellence in the world of hobby-gaming" means.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor overall excellence of what the world of hobby-gaming has to offer, there is no question... Mouse Guard. It's traditional enough that many D&amp;D; players accept it, it's innovative enough that it expands how people play, it's an elegant design, it's one of the best written texts that explains what Roleplaying is and tells you how to actually do it, and it's friendly to new players.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor pure innovation, Dominion or Sweet Agatha.

Outreach to non hobby gamers seems to be a big part of what they give awards for.<br>\n<br>\nOn that tack, Mouse Guard is out in my view since it is a distillation of stuff that has been published before. That said, I haven't read it since the source material doesn't interest me.<br>\n<br>\nDominion is a tricky one, because it is really innovative but it doesn't have that outreach potential the way Ticket to Ride did. My guess is out.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D 4e is an interesting one. I think it will probably be more influential on the hobby than any other game, and I think most of that influence is positive. It does take a different approach to design, and D&amp;D Insider really takes that up a level. However, I think the impression that D&amp;D 4e will win the Ennies as a full slate will work against it.  And it doesn't put stories or bring gaming into the wider world much. I think it's a miss.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven't read Sweet Agatha, but in terms of innovation and potential outreach it looks very strong. It also has the advantage that all of the judges can easily try it out, which the big weakness of my other top pick.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeepform is my personal favorite because I think the Diana Jones awards should reward deep innovation more than changing or perfecting the hobby. It really reimagines tabletop and larp and improv into a whole new package. I also think that Jeepform should win because it has the most potential to pick up attention and have a greater influence on the conversation if it wins (Sweet Agatha would also qualify here). <br/>\n<br/>\nFinal call? Joint award for Jeepform and Sweet Agatha.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222029/#Comment_222029" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T08:20:46+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  8:20AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think if Vi Aker Jeep wins it will be a sad reflection of the utter disdain that American game designers hold American live-action traditions in, and their corresponding utter ignorance of their own live-action traditions.

I think the reason Jeep and other Nordic larp traditions have exploded across the American indie scene had a lot to do with packaging those experiences so they were easily transmittable to tabletop audiences, speaking in the high-falutin' pseudo-but-not-really-acedemic speak of the Forge (in the annual conventions book, for example), and coming over here to run their games specifically for this crowd. Also, I blame Emily Care and John Kim, for being evangelists on our side of the pond.  I have some relatively close friends who are involved in various larp-like activities, but they're clearly doing their own thing over there while we're doing our own thing over here, and both sides have become relatively comfortable with that arrangement in the US.  I mean, you know how this works: people go traveling to find themselves, right?<br/><br/>Honestly, the Diana Jones Award is like Game Chef, winning is the least important part.  They should go ahead and declare that the winner is "Your Mom," so we can focus on the cool work that the nominees have done, rather than worrying about who should win.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222036/#Comment_222036" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T09:45:20+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  9:45AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm saying it would be a sad commentary on the utter ignorance of American tabletop game designers: Not just indie people but also the 90s gametelligentsia that the DJA represents.

I must confess that when I think about american LARP is usually think about people hitting each other with swords or playing vampires, so I never was very interested on it and I didn't know nothing about the AG.<br/><br/>And I found this on their website:<br/><br/>------------------<br/>What is Live Roleplaying?<br/><br/>Basically,<b> it's "Let's Pretend" for grownups</b>. As in any roleplaying game, <b>each player takes on the role of a fictional character</b>. You play your character much as you would in an improvisational theatre setting, with a strong knowledge of who you are and what you want out of life, but with no script. Together, you and a group of other players create an imaginary world and a multitude of stories. These not games of "killer" or "assassin" (well, not always): the emphasis is often on dramatic roleplaying and interaction between players. Most live games involve a large number of players (twenty to thirty people are the norm for Guild games) who walk around and talk with each other, acting out as much of their characters' actions as are safe. Unlike many tabletop roleplaying games (D&amp;D and other games of its ilk), most live roleplaying games have a strong emphasis on player-player interaction rather than on interaction between the players and the world which is controlled by the Gamemasters (GMs), making the games very social events as well as intellectual and creative challenges. Why do it? Because it's lots of fun to be someone else for a few hours or a few days at a time, and to do it with other people.<br/>--------------------------------------<br/><br/>And this:<br/><br/>So how do they work? Who runs them? How do I get involved?<br/><br/>The Assassin's Guild runs several games every semester. Each game is run by a different GM team, who are all Guild members or alums. Sometimes people run prewritten games, but usually GM teams will write their own game. Consequently, <b>the genres range from spy thrillers to military science fiction to high fantasy</b>, and games last anywhere from several hours to ten days (you don't have to be in game all ten days, of course!) <br/><br/>------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Ben, do you really have no idea of what Jeepform is?<br/><br/>[edited for language]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222111/#Comment_222111" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-02T17:59:16+00:00" title="August  2, 2009  5:59PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2009 6:11PM by johnzo.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have never jeeped or sweet agatha'd.  For all I know those things might each individually be way more cool than Mouse Guard and DnD combined in a giant mecha that is piloted by a pyromanical elven netrunner. <br/><br/>But I do know Mouse Guard and D&amp;D4E.  I've played both a bunch, and I think they each deserve to be recognized.  Were I part of the shadowy DJ cabal, I would vote for the Mouse.<br/><br/>4E is a game that put the fun back in D&amp;D for me. I believe that its chief virtues are its uncompromising focus on tactically rich miniature play, its online support (which is awesome, if less than promised), and the use of exception-based design to permute a mechanical base of medium complexity into something that feels like it could be fresh for quite some time.  I like how its rules try to make everyone at the table relevant all the time.  I treasure its rules organization.  Putting all the chunky stuff into card-size hunks of text makes all those exceptions much, much easier to manage.  And I've also been thinking lately about how much I appreciate the default fluff.  I like how there is just the vaguest suggestion of a backstory in the core texts -- something mildly familiar to all players, and something that each table can riff on and make their own, something that gives my imagination a boost into DnDspace.<br/><br/>Alas, 4E is also an evolving work, with many loose ends and and unpatched bugs that kind of justify a 4.5E or a 4E Revised.  The power escalation between MMI and MMII was kind of shocking.  The game feels unfinished, rushed to market.  I'm also grumpy about Wizards' sudden decision to get out of the PDF business.  Searchable PDFs are almost a necessity for me these days, and PDF updates could be tied into the DnDinsider service to all kinds of good effect.  I also wish their prepackaged adventures exploited the tactical richness of their system a bit better.  Reading a 4E D&amp;D module is like reading a manual to Photoshop that doesn't ever mention layers.<br/><br/>So D&amp;D is great, but is not the greatest.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, Mouse Guard is a humming hand-built German sedan of fun.  The game feels complete in one volume and won't require a second edition or any expansions down the road.   That volume is beautiful and well-organized.  The premise is surprisingly compelling and evoked perfectly by the ruleset.  <br/><br/>This game doesn't just enable my fun -- it <i>provokes</i> it.  I love how the advancement system makes me seek out tasks that are improbable or impossible to succeed at.  I love the Nature rules, which communicate the exceptionality of the guard mice, which give me a powerful and limited resource to whomp ass with, and which feel driftable to everything from Dogs to Jedi.  I love the tripartite flagging of the Beliefs, Instincts, and Goals.  <br/><br/>Most of all, I love how Mouse Guard acknowledges the actual practices of the hobby instead of some idealized theory of it.  I love how players who miss game sessions are rewarded for narrating what drew their mice away from the patrol, turning something that's a drag into something that's an opportunity.  I love how the extended conflict rules encourage team play by breaking down the patrol into easily-organized little subteams.  Mouse Patrols actual feel like little military units, instead of the swarms of leaderless ronin I see in other military-ish games.<br/><br/>Basically, in Mouse Guard, every elaborate bit feels justified, and that's why I'd vote for it.  But I feel blessed to have them both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222243/#Comment_222243" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T12:18:06+00:00" title="August  3, 2009 12:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/><br/>I also hope it's not Dominion, just because I'd like it to be won by someone who actually cares about the award.</blockquote>\nWhat makes you say they wouldn't care about the award?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tony%20Pace" title="Tony Pace"><img alt="Tony Pace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tony%20Pace">Tony Pace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222320/#Comment_222320" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-03T18:44:45+00:00" title="August  3, 2009  6:44PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ticket to Ride's award is not mentioned on the box or in the pamphlet. It is on an awards section of the web site. Their Spiel des Jahres is prominently featured everywhere. Looking this up, I noticed that Board Game Geek doesn't have a separate page for Diana Jones award winners. Dominion's nomination is mentioned not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe boardgame world has their own awards and structures that drive attention and sales to new games. Newness and innovation are routinely big winners and are almost sure to drive a bit of hotness as people try to find out more. The roleplaying field is much more driven by supplements and new editions and many of the awards seem to serve the giants of the field more than anything else. The Diana Jones Award serves a strong purpose there as an indicator of something different that gamers might be interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure the Dominion team would be happy to get the award, but I'm also sure that it would be little more than an afterthought compared to their Spiel des Jahres. Dominion is past the point where it needs more publicity within the hobby.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Old%20Scratch" title="Old Scratch"><img alt="Old Scratch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Old%20Scratch">Old Scratch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222385/#Comment_222385" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T08:18:05+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  8:18AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tony Pace</cite>Dominion is past the point where it needs more publicity within the hobby.</blockquote>\nOh, is this award about "needs"? I thought it was about deserving.<br/><br/>And Dominion is a great example of excellence in game design. I like a lot of the other stuff on the short list, but I'd like to put forward the case for Dominion here. I am personally torn between a couple of the games, but Dominion is a notable card game. Design-wise, it's the biggest thing to happen in card games since magic. For card games, its fairly revolutionary and I think that should be acknowledged. It is very easy to learn, very accessible, and after reading the rules for ten minuntes (basically, play actions, buy, clean up and draw five), you're playing the game. We've had games finish in under ten minutes. And even though you're only building a deck from ten sets of cards, there are millions of configurations and the game is addictive in play. And very important, non gamers have had no problem picking up this game and playing it in under five minutes.<br/><br/>The game deserves to be on the Diana Jones short list, and I also believe that it is as deserving to win as any other on this list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222395/#Comment_222395" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T09:10:47+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  9:10AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The short list nominee is actually Vi \xe5ker Jeep, the collective, not Jeepform, the body of techniques they developed and promote.</blockquote>\nOn the front page of the DJA, it says this about the Jeep nominee: <b>\u2022 Jeepform, a game-style from Scandinavia (fostered by the Vi \xe5ker jeep collective)</b><br/><br/>It seems to me that the nominee is actually Jeepform, the "style", and not the Vi \xe5ker Jeep collective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222426/#Comment_222426" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T10:37:19+00:00" title="August  4, 2009 10:37AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I concur: Jeepform shouldn't be nominated.

Luke already won an Origin Award for Burning Empires. Didn't get indie games much more noticed. (and the fact that you did forget about it tell how much)<br/><br/>And I find rather ironic that people who refuse to find anything "innovative" in the collective that created games like "Doubt" or "The Upgrade" or "GR"  ("because we in America already did all of that! It's exactly like a boffer larp!"  ;-)  then applaud the 4th edition of D&amp;D or the 4rd incarnation of the Burning Wheel system...  ;-)<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, in an award for "excellence" I would not see nothing wrong in a Mouse Guard victory. It's a EXCELLENT product.

Comparing something like that to Jeepform It's like comparing a Vampire LARP to My Life With Master...  :-)<br/><br/>(I think David should learn more about the difference before saying that americans already did everything before, but I am strange that way...)<br/><br/>I fear that history is repeating itself: some years ago Pohjola, with his "Turku School Manifesto", convinced the entire USA rpg scene that the Turku School was the way everyone in the nordic countries LARPed (and not a tiny art-house manifesto in a country full of people who liked swords and elves in their LARP).  Now, after hearing something about this thing called "Jeepform" (that is even MORE controversial and cutting edge in his home country than in the USA) it seems that people use that for everything that isn't a boffer lARP. <br/><br/>Exactly like a Texan is the same as a Canadian, they are all American, no cultural difference whatsoever... and everybody knows that all Americans play only GURPS.  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222801/#Comment_222801" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T13:31:21+00:00" title="August  5, 2009  1:31PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2009 1:42PM by David Artman.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [edit... ah, fuck it, never mind....]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10000/who-should-win-the-diana-jones-award" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10000/who-should-win-the-diana-jones-award" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10000/who-should-win-the-diana-jones-award/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F10000%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F10000%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
