It seem also obvious that you had to <b>track</b> a lot of things.<br/>Concretely, the green circles represent the players (3 to 6).<br/>You begin a scene with an Overture (Ouverture), then you go to the Suspense and finally to the Climax. <br/>The succes (or failure) to the Scene is determined by succes/failure during the Climax. <br/>But succes/failure to Overture and Suspense grant you a bonus/malus for the Climax resolution, depending on how many players have succeed. So you can use the green circles to track succes/failure, and determining the final conditions for resolving the Climax.<br/><br/>it's just part of the information on the "boardiagram" anyway...<br/><br/>I don't know Pathdinder (yes, i don't) and just have an overwiew of Sorcerer so i can't tell you how it could work in this case. But GM-centric or not, i think it depend on complexity. Traditional RPG were more <i>complicated </i>than <i>complex </i>(the distinction is not mine unfortunately) and it was more about memorizing ( tables, tables...) than understanding. A game like CAPES is complex, you have to understand/figure out how it works, and it's hard to get the big picture and remember it.<br/><br/> So i think it would be more usefull for this kind of games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh" title="Maitresinh"><img alt="Maitresinh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maitresinh">Maitresinh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337653/#Comment_337653" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T13:09:10+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  1:09PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2011 1:10PM by Maitresinh.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>This reminds me of the<a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/downloads/index.php?file=fiasco_play_mat.pdf" rel="nofollow">Play mat</a>I worked up for Fiasco.

There's not really all that much info going on.<br/><br/>Anyways, the basic narrative structure in the game is a scene. A scene has 3 rounds - Overture, Suspense, Climax. During each of those rounds, every player gets a single action, mechanically (although it can represent a series of actions within the game world). An action is a basic 2d6+skill vs target number. There are ways to get bonuses but that's beside the point. Each round has a Round Difficulty, which is the number of successes the team needs to gather at that round in order to succeed.<br/>The outcome in the scene as a whole is determined by whether the team succeeds or fails in the Climax.<br/>Gaining more successes than necessary in other rounds gives bonuses to all rolls on the following round. Failing increases the difficulty of the Climax.<br/><br/>The precentages represnt general guidelines for scene diificulty. Hard scenes either require everyone to succeed at Climax or everyone to succeed at both Overture and Suspense; Medium scenes require more than half successes at Climax etc. Those are mostly just rules of thumb though; after several scenes the GM should develop a decent feeling on how to determine difficulties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ODDin" title="ODDin"><img alt="ODDin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ODDin">ODDin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337672/#Comment_337672" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T15:07:37+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  3:07PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.
