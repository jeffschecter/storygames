                    OK, this has been buzzing around my head for the last couple of months and I'm hoping that someone can help me with it.  It's based kind of on some of the early posts of Misery Bubblegum.<br/><br/>So you have a character and a pile of tokens colored for your character.  I think the basic game play would go as follows:<br/><br/>1) <b>Establish or magnify a trait.</b>  Basically you can spend a token to say something about your character Universalis style (o it doesn't matter really what the trait is, the fact that you paid for it makes it relevant).<br/><br/>2) <b>Introduce conflict.</b>  You can also spend tokens to introduce a conflict.  Other players can spend tokens to get a piece of the conflict.  If no other player buys in by the end of the game, you win the conflict but don't get anything for it.<br/><br/>3) <b>Resolve conflicts.</b>  All conflicts with buy ins get resolved.  Characters pick a trait that is useful and put the tokens from that trait into a bag.  Then they pull out tokens and that does something.  Somehow you can call on other traits if you are losing and want to win.<br/><br/>This is very bare bones, but I can't figure out where I really want to go with it.  I want there to be a build up of conflicts where each game session is spent introducing traits for characters and conflicts and then at the end resolving things.  I am enamored with the idea of conflicts being resolved by players pulling colored stones out of a bag and using that as a pacing mechanism.  I just don't know how to do it.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>

                            One thing to consider, if you're drawing chips from a bag, are what can happen and what it means.<br/>Let's say we have a bag called "Conflict X, created by some player, full of chips. I pull out 1 chip.<br/>- what happens if it's my color?<br/>- what happens if it's not? <br/>Let's say I pull out two chips<br/>- what happens if my color is not represented?<br/>- what happens if the chips are the same color?<br/>- what happens if they're both my color?<br/>- what if one of them is my color?<br/>You may already know this, but Universalis, Capes, and Mortal Coil all use chip-based mechanisms. I'm a huge fan of this mechanism, especially for GM-less play.                        </div>

                            Overnight I thought that maybe each player puts a trait into the conflict and then starting with the player with the smallest trait can add a secret amount of free tokens into the bag.  Then players take turns pulling tokens out of the bag with the first player pulling out one, the second two and so on.  Players describe the action going on, with the color of token saying who has the current advantage (so if I pull out two of your tokens, I have to narrate things going well for you).  At the end, you add the number of tokens you put in the bag to twice the trait that you put into the conflict, and the one with the highest amount wins.<br/><br/>It's basically blind bidding, but with a pacing mechanism built into the reveal.  I think I'd like the pulling out of stones to be more exciting.                        </div>
