That should be more than enough time to learn the rules and organize a session.<br/><br/><b>Details:</b> "The RPG Club". Play at least one session of one game (more if you can/want to), then discuss the results here.<br/>Half the effort is organizing and engaging in play. The other half is discussing with others what you did/didn't like about the game, how your session went, etc.<br/><br/><b>STEP ONE</b>: Locate/Purchase the game. Kagematsu is available from the Cream Alien Games website: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/creamaliengames/Home/kagematsu-the-rpg/buy-it" rel="nofollow">HERE</a><br/><br/><b>STEP TWO:</b> Play the game, at least once.<br/><br/><b>STEP THREE:</b> Start a group discussion of the game in a new thread.<br/><br/>I imagine a single "RPG Book Club: KAGEMATSU" thread, where people go in and post their thoughts, before (reading) or after they actually play the game.<br/><br/><b>STEP FOUR (optional)</b>: If you had fun, keep playing.<br/><br/><b>STEP FIVE (very optional):</b> Review the game in its own "The Game Report" (category) thread, if you have a lot to say about it.<br/><br/>Thoughts or discussion on the actual "RPG Book/Game Club" activity, feel free to post here.

I can't say that about any other game.

The works of the game is just great! We changed the scenery a lot after some sessions with playbook rules. No matter how we decided to change the game's setting, the rules always worked. I plan to move the game from \u014cnin no Ran (or Muromachi period, which I think was the one that got into the final version) to some later times, 19th century probably.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as for "An Introduction" as an affection, we had it two ways, depending on how we played:<br/>\n- for legendary Nippon, we played courtesy and official introduction, as a short scene with some emphasis on revealing true bloodline or family name of Kagematsu or an introduction to the woman and her family at the same time. I guess this is normal.<br/>\n- for scary Nippon, we had a strong entrance that leaves a longlasting impression e.g. The girl is sitting near the seashore. Kagematsu slowly gets out of the fog and approaches the village. By the time the boat reaches the shore, it is almost full of water. He leaves the boat and very soon it sinks completely. When soaking Kagematsu passes the girl and looks at her, she sees a bloody human bone in his hand.Then he says "Hello" and we are ready to roll.

I'm 3 for 3 on Story Games Book Club! Do I get an achievement?<br/><br/><br/>Carolyn played Kagematsu, the ronin who washed up on the shores of our village "Umi no Hikari" - from her notes: "quiet", "women are delicate flowers, better looked at &amp; touched gently", "terribly depressed."<br/><br/>No doubt the storm that destroyed Kagematsu's boat was due to the increasingly malevolent ocean (the Threat) - turned increasingly malicious because we had not made the annual sacrifice of an able-bodied man. We thought Kappas might be related to the threat, but weren't sure, willing to let it come out in play. <br/><br/>I played Hana, husband dead in the wars, her favorite person her child Kenji, who some said should have been the sacrifice.<br/><br/>Shuo played Noriko, another war-widow, who ran a restaurant, with a favorite cat, Tama.<br/><br/>Marc played Hiromi, 19-year old aspiring Kabuki actress, living with her cripped older brother.<br/><br/>Johnzo played Fumi, brewer of potions with hair hanging over her eyes - whose first reaction on seeing the nearly-drowned Kagematsu was that he should be thrown into the ocean to appease the water spirits.<br/><br/>I would have dismissed the game as 'parlor narration', the sort of game where you roll dice and then make up a little story to go along with what the dice tell you, but Carolyn secretly keeping tallies of Kagematsu's love and pity for the rest of us really made how we narrated and acted matter. It really pushed me out of my comfort zone - playing a seductive woman (actually I played kind of hard-to-get) was probably the most 'unsafe' I've played ever.<br/><br/>Some great moments - <br/><br/>Fumi discovered (a secret told) that Kagematsu's dead wife had the same name as our village - and later allowed herself to be possessed by the spirit of his dead wife (in order to win confession of love) - Kagematsu was appalled at first, but as his dead wife questioned his honor and begged and pleaded he came around. <br/><br/>And later went off to get drunk. The kabuki actress took advantage of Kagematsu's drunkeness to try and win an escort home. Kagematsu was sarcastic and dismissive.<br/><br/>We introduced chrystanthemums as a motif early - and then Shuo pointed out, "Hey, you know in Japanese culture the chrystanthemum is a symbol of death, right?" And we were like. "Huh. Well, that works."<br/><br/>The possessed Fumi tried to make Kagematsu promise to save the town - but rolled three sixes - and the spirit of his dead wife was driven away.<br/><br/>Hana's son ran away from home to sacrifice himself - and that was how Hana made Kagematsu promise, demanding that he save her son.<br/><br/>In the confrontation, sure that the village troubles were caused by a Kappa, Noriko took an armload of cucumbers aboard a small boat out to sea and drowned.<br/><br/>The ronin walked into the underwater spirit world and confronted the Kappa - instead of attacking directly he went with the diplomatic approach, and when the Kana bowed to the polite ronin the water spilled out of its head. (That's what Kappa do, apparently. Shuo said so.) But still, the Kana refused to return the ronin's dead wife - so the ronin settled for a promise to leave the town alone, and the boy, and refilled the Kana's head. The town was saved.<br/><br/>In the end - Hiromi decided to leave for the big city to see if she could make it there; Noriko's abandoned cat came to live with Fumi; and Kagematsu declared his love for Hana and they became a family. Aw.<br/><br/>We loved it. Carolyn liked getting a taste of what it's like to GM - I liked getting pushed out of my comfort zone - we all liked getting desperation moves unlocked - we liked the sacrifice mechanic - and we want to play it again, this time with a bad or shallow ronin, to see what that's like.<br/><br/>Nitpicks - we had some trouble figuring out the shadow dice. Having a track for them on the character sheet didn't seem useful since they reset after every roll. For most of the game we were pooling Kagematsu's dice with the townswoman; later we realized we weren't supposed to do that. The first way seems too hard at the end; the second way seems like not enough threat scenes would happen...(we got the best of both worlds by switching near the end.)<br/><br/>The other nitpick is the one-on-oneness of the scenes - now that Carolyn has some experience as Kagematsu she'd probably try to include more townswomen in each scene, so there could be some more townswomen interaction, but there's no in-game incentive to do that - one could hack it to have one or two townswomen-only scenes interspersed. (We did have one scene with us in the hot springs where the kabuki actress and the restaurant owner got quite catty with each other that was pretty fun.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340089/#Comment_340089" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T18:38:46+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  6:38PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played at MoatCon.<br/><br/>Brief A.P. highlights.<br/><br/>One woman, playing Kagematsu.<br/>Three guys, playing village women.<br/><br/>Characters included:<br/>Two girls, 22 and 19 I believe?  One woman of 40 who was the mother of the 19 year old.<br/><br/>The two girls went 4/3 and 5/2, favoring innocence.  The woman went with 2/5, favoring Charm.<br/>It would up being a touching tale of the mother trying to do what she can for her village, and also to protect her daughter, but struggling against her age.  And her daughter was trying to grow out of her mother's control, who had kept her a little too naieve a little too long.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, our third village woman had some awesome scenes, but she couldn't get her Fear down.  Every time she would get a good thing going, and get a few Affections unlocked, she would go for one more, and the Threat, or Faulure would end the scene, and all that Fear would stay with her.  Her story was very interesting, but didn't wind up being the focus.<br/><br/>Kagematsu's secret was that he was on the run, from a destroyed village, and he had failed to defend it, because he was shamefully drunk.<br/><br/>Our threat was an Oni that was squatting in our shrine, defiling the village.  He showed up several times indirectly... first as Kagematsu and woman were walking, they walked past a burned, destroyed house... which was made all the more awesome because they had just been talking about loss.  When that third 6 got rolled, they saw a physical representation of the loss they still felt, and the scene ended.<br/><br/>Next time the wall of the stable rotted away because of the Oni's influence, and Kagematsu's horse ran off into the forest, spooked by the taint of evil.<br/><br/>The slow escallation made the Oni more fearsome, as we didn't see it at all until late in the game.<br/><br/>In the end, the mother/daughter team had 2/3 fear respectively, and the other woman had 6.  She ended herself (and the player said he would have picked that regardless of the mechanical benefit, as he thought her story was better as a tragedy.)  The other two stayed around, confident that 5 fear would be an easy win.<br/><br/>Until the Mother rolled 14 on three dice.<br/><br/>Our ending was about as tragic as it got.  Kagematsu is impaled on the Oni's horn, the mother gets caught under a burning building, and the daughter is trampled by Kagematsu's horse as it runs out of the descimated town.  Honestly?  The woman playing our Kagematsu was deeply touched that the horse made it into the final narration.<br/><br/>My thoughts-<br/><br/>It's been tough to get the hang of a high Charm character.  This isn't my first time doing it, but I think the maternal handle, along with the age, helped me narrate things in a more respectful way.  Our Kagematsu seemed to respond a lot better to this performance than some of mine in the past.<br/><br/>We had table talk, and some competitive attitudes, and that helped.  We even had some of the characters cross through each other's scenes, but not interfere with the Affection.  It was something we only glimpsed at Camp Nerdly, but really explored this time.  I don't think I want to cross the line and have more than one "active" townswoman in each scene, but it was tense and terrible having them in the wings, plotting.<br/><br/>With only three of us, we just rotated scenes evenly (instead of having one woman do three affections in a row, and then be out of the rotation while everyone catches up in Fear.)  It was really seemless, and we didn't have to keep having scene after scene with our woman with the high Fear.  It has been a little exhausting in the past.<br/><br/>Our Kagematsu thinks you shouldn't lose the Affection if you tie.  Which I sort of agree with.  I like the rules for Ties, and the "turning your back on a Favorite" thing, in the same way that I like "The Horror Revealed" in My Life with Master.  But in Kagematsu, it seems like getting a Tie on the second or subsequent Affection in a scene is a little too much of an edge case.  Not a complaint, just thoughts.  I would like to see the "turning your back on a Favorite" more in game, but I'm not sure how to use it other than as described.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NCLivingBrit" title="NCLivingBrit"><img alt="NCLivingBrit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NCLivingBrit">NCLivingBrit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340102/#Comment_340102" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-22T20:35:52+00:00" title="August 22, 2011  8:35PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2011 8:38PM by NCLivingBrit.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was the 19yr old in the Moatcon game, second time I have played Kagematsu.
