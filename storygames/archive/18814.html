A couple of the basic cues don't really map well to a more tactical level story wargame, but those seem easily fixed (i.e., Supply instead of Supply Line; the later seems more operational in scale). Is there anywhere that others have added a few more cues to this basic matrix for this scale of wargame RPG experience? I was thinking that Fire, Scout, Flank, Overwatch and some one-time cues like Sniper or Forward Observer might work. Are there any that people think might additionally be added?<br/><br/>My mechanics question revolves around the idea that perhaps each player has their own set of cues, and when arguing a "turn" with five cues, those five might be locked down for the next turn so they were unusable until the following turn of thesis/antithesis. Would that upset the mechanics too much, do you think?<br/><br/>Finally, is the concept behind the Engle-Matrix game mechanics open-source (the idea behind the matrix gaming engine itself), or if I wanted to develop an game idea using the EM mechanics as one of it's base mechanics, is that okay? I'm thinking of adding a set of cards that would be the scene setters and a few other things.<br/><br/>Thanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421592/#Comment_421592" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-17T05:05:39+00:00" title="September 17, 2013  5:05AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll answer your question about creative rights in a succinct manner: game mechanics, and ideas in general, are not protected by the usual IP protections that people tend to draw on in gaming. To wit, neither copyright nor trademark applies to game rules. For this reason it is generally legal to lift game design ideas from other games for use in your own, as long as you don't copy direct expression (which could violate copyright) or market your work by riding the coat-tails of the original (which could violate trademark).<br/><br/>(The type of intellectual property that might work for game mechanics is a patent. However, as the patent system hasn't really been envisioned to work at this small a scale, and game design innovations that are both patentable and valuable are rare, it's basically a dead letter for our purposes. WotC apparently did patent "tapping a card" in the late '90s, but that action has not had much in the way of practical consequences. My impression is that most people find patenting game design notions ridiculous - I certainly do myself, as I consider game design more comparable to art than engineering.)<br/><br/>Regardless of the legal factors, however, you need to consider your moral and ethical standing when copying game mechanics from others. The general community standard in this matter (and yes, a term like "community standard" definitely implies that there are people who disagree, it's not a law of nature) is that the upstanding game designer does not hesitate to build upon the work of others, but he acknowledges his sources and asks permission if the reliance on prior work goes beyond merely "taking influence" and into the realm of outright reinterpretation of prior work. The expected response to any such queries about using your work is to encourage it amiably, of course - as I outlined above, there isn't really any legal leg to stand on to prevent others from taking influence, so talking about it in advance is primarily a point of etiquette, to prevent embarrassing post-publication mudslinging.<br/><br/>Considering prior cases, it is extremely rare for a gaming project to get negative publicity for being derivative of prior art, except in cases where copyright or trademark has been flouted, in which cases the general public finds plenty of reason to complain and moralize about it. The simplest way to fuck up aside from copyright or trademark is plagiarism (taking influence while pretending that it's your own work), which can be a bit tricky at times because of how the standards of good scholarship differ in between e.g. OGL publishing (which is generally extremely reluctant to name sources due to the complications of the license) and Forgean indie publishing (which generally emphasizes useful bibliographies and exact attribution of sources).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveyJJ" title="DaveyJJ"><img alt="DaveyJJ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveyJJ">DaveyJJ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421593/#Comment_421593" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-17T05:54:24+00:00" title="September 17, 2013  5:54AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am in contact with Chris Engle as of this morning re: his thoughts etc and passed along more details about what I am doing with some of my in-progress developing games, and will report back.

Legal question solved. BAM!<br/><br/>I've given permission to the British French and Australian militarys to use them. They tend to use the matrix of words idea a lot but the idea can be taken is other directions. <br/><br/>As to adding more ideas to the matrix - Do it! The whole idea of the matrix is that it suggests ideas, it doesn't limit. I've found that giving players a list of key words helps people think of what to do. Without some guide lines people get lost with endless possibilities. Over in England the list is usually presented as a list you can pull from every turn. When I used the list it was a set of cards placed on a table face up. Players in turn would pull cards from the table to make their arguments (action - results - 3 reasons) I'd always go last in those games and show that you could still pretty much all you wanted by twisting the meaning of the cards around. That led me to drop the cards all together by the late 90's. Eventually I settled on the idea that players just say what happens in story form rather than in an argument form. This worked but took away that useful structure to help players know what to do. <br/><br/>In the last couple of years I've come back to cards. Fairy Tale Assassin League uses a deck of action cards (with things like betray, guilt trip, awkward silence, etc.) to suggest ideas. Players are limited to a five card hand so there are even more restrictions on play which I think are helping new players. Right now I'm working on a deck to run miniature wargames. It will use two separate decks - one for the big picture and one for individual fights. It in untested but I've got high hopes.<br/><br/>One issue of Matrix games in story games is that the original rules had players roll for every action they made to see if it happens. An experienced referee judged the likelihood of an action happening and the player rolled. This meant that unrealistic arguments got shot down at that stage. While this may be good for simulation games and maybe education games, it sucks for fun because it builds in the whiff factor. It kills energy. I've learned a lot from the story game community about this so now my games are - play a card and make a story, another person plays a card and adds to the story. Both happen unless a player specifically says the other doesn't. The rolls when made are not there to shoot down action but to help determine who gets the last word at the end of the game. <br/><br/>Email me your address off list and I'll send you out a copy of the tactical game when it's done and please do share what you come up with here on the list and in the other forums you participate in. <br/><br/>Good designing!<br/><br/>Chris<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421596/#Comment_421596" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-17T07:46:15+00:00" title="September 17, 2013  7:46AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2013 7:57AM by Dreamer.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .<blockquote><br/><br/>My mechanics question revolves around the idea that perhaps each player has their own set of cues, and when arguing a "turn" with five cues, those five might be locked down for the next turn so they were unusable until the following turn of thesis/antithesis.

Looking at formal argument structure could be a useful approach. If a game is linked to miniatures then the placement of minis on the map can set up states that negate or open up the use of a certain card or item on a list (for instance you can't hit someone who isn't there). <br/><br/><br/>Komradebob<br/><br/>Combining grand tactical and tactical actions in one does really confuse things doesn't it? What I'm thinking is that the big picture action cards will cover movement and story elements (like might appear in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Flashman" rel="nofollow">Harry Flashman novel</a>) While combat would be separate decks, played in a fast paced slam down a card fashion like the card game war. Each side would have its own deck so a zombie deck would be different from a hero deck which would be different from a little girl deck, etc. But like I said, it's a half baked idea.<br/><br/>Give different players different decks could be a really cool thing though. One of my games for next year "Die Romeo Die" uses a deck built from lines in Rap music. I was amazed how dark and narrow it makes the player's options. It won't be a nice 1970's upbeat disco kind of game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421617/#Comment_421617" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-17T12:56:30+00:00" title="September 17, 2013 12:56PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">@MatrixGamer</a><br/><br/>I actually think that your 3 reason format is pretty nifty. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> At its heart, it matches the structure of arguments in formal logic (premise 1 + Premise 2 ...+ Premise n = conclusion), which is why I thought reviewing those concepts might prove inspirational if a person wants to build something around the matrix mechanics. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421619/#Comment_421619" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-17T13:54:07+00:00" title="September 17, 2013  1:54PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I first came up with it I was thinking about Hegel and looking at Boolian Logic.<br/><br/>In commercial games I found that talking about logic and argument wasn't a good selling point.

It's part of what makes this hobby ( or all these separate, related hobbies) so much fun to discuss!<br/><br/>I'm currently pondering putting a "between" scenes/encounters/story chunks phase into a play-method ( I hate to call it a game, really, but no better, existing, term suggests itself) that I'm working on for a minis Not-Wargame.<br/><br/>I don't even quite know how it should work myself, or how it should work in specific scenarios/games. It isn't even really half-baked. It's more like I've got the flour, butter, sugar, eggs, and mixing bowl gathered on the counter and the oven is pre-heating!<br/><br/>Right now, it's a bit like this:<br/>It's a scene-based game. <br/>It uses miniatures. <br/>It uses a single big table ( an actual table layout with miniatures, not a big chart).<br/>You really don't use the whole table at once for any given scene. You select a limited portion of it, much like you'd select a location/characters/set up in a verbal-only game. You zoom and play out the scene.<br/><br/>Afterwards, and before the next scene, that's when players have a chance to do micro-scenes or ask/answer/add new stuff at the broader, zoomed out scale. Then onward to the next scene, maybe with those other things now opening/limiting options. And so on for the course of play.<br/><br/>My actual examples are rather specific, so I'll try to use something folks might be familiar with: the old movie, <i>A Bridge Too Far</i>.<br/>It's about the operations surrounding Arnhem in WW2. Played as a wargame, you'd normally zoom out and show the overall operations, or zoom in and focus on maybe the tactical fight of the British paratrooper try to hang on until relief arrives. Either way you'd be limited. On one end of the scale, you don't get the gritty, personal level of the conflict and on the other, you miss out on the broader things going on covered by the film.<br/><br/>My concept would be more like: Do a scene. Maybe a mini fight, maybe a dramatic scene. maybe a combo of the two. Doesn't matter here any more than it would in any other scene-based, action-heavy RPG.<br/><br/>Scene finishes and players have an ability to zoom out and talk about broader things going on. Are the germans getting their response together? Are the Polish paras winning their argument for a faster support drop? What about the American and British support columns that are supposed to be coming down the road to relieve the British paras? What is the local German commander up to as he tries to contain and overwhelm the paras without losing too many of his own men?<br/><br/>...And then once more back down to some local level based on those broader, more sketched in events and concepts.<br/><br/>Wash, rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>And, of course, usable for not-so-wargame-y situations as well. Right now I'm working on the concept for a Scooby-Doo Gang goes to Innsmouth Halloween game.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421679/#Comment_421679" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-19T13:57:20+00:00" title="September 19, 2013  1:57PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting stuff; sounds like a form of Wushu Open with more mechanical teeth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421688/#Comment_421688" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-20T05:20:27+00:00" title="September 20, 2013  5:20AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2013 5:30AM by MatrixGamer.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want - no I need!
