I have a use for them.<br/><br/>Secondly, not all of these steps are conflicts, but all the ones I can think of are <b>in some way related (or relatable) to conflicts</b>. Some are changes of personal perspective which influence what someone will get into conflicts about; some are avoidance of conflict (which tells us something about the character); some serve to prefigure the conflict; some to make the conflict, when it comes, more poignant; some give resources (or, I suppose, take away resources) which could be used in later conflicts. I'd welcome suggestions of examples that have nothing to do with conflicts whatsoever, but I can't myself come up with any offhand.<br/><br/>Third, many of them (as you've alluded to) <b>don't have unknown outcomes</b>, at least not at the meta level - the character may be unaware of the outcome, but as a story-savvy audience, we <i>know</i> that the first two sons of the king are going to fail because they were rude to the old lady/fox, and the third son will succeed because he was helpful.<br/><br/>There's no need for a resolution system for these ones. We know what's going to happen and we narrate it. Maybe the way in which we narrate it becomes significant in some way in the long term, but what we're looking at here is <i>not a conflict</i> because it's not a matter of "it could go either way". We might even say going in, "Oh, I know how this one goes." That's what makes it a formula.<br/><br/>I mean, shy girl meets attractive boy, roll dice to see if she talks to him? I don't think so. Of course she doesn't talk to him. She's Shy Girl. But maybe something about the way she doesn't talk to him, or the way her player describes the scene, becomes significant and can be reincorporated later on when she does talk to him (which, of course, she eventually does).<br/><br/>Yeah?</blockquote>\nSo, this is that barnraising. It's also a split from Tony's thread, because Tony's interested in a wider scope than this.<br/><br/>Here's one possible formula for formulas. It's based, unsurprisingly, on my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4050" rel="nofollow">gateways</a> idea.<br/><br/><i><b>Title</b></i><br/><b>Conditions:</b><br/>- Series of steps - numbered when sequence matters, bulleted when it doesn't.<br/>- Probably about five give or take two.<br/>- A set of alternatives can be given for one or more of the steps.<br/>- Some of the steps can be conflicts if you like. Mark these: *.<br/><b>Attainment:</b><br/>A new static situation that arises as a result of completing the arc. This can be getting a  new resource, being able to take a particular action you couldn't before, a change to the character...<br/><b>Challenge:</b><br/>A new dynamic situation that arises out of completing the arc.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE (adapted from my example in Tony's thread):<br/><br/><i><b>Shy Girl Overcomes Shyness</b></i><br/><b>Conditions:</b><br/>1. Be with attractive boy in the same room and wish you could talk to him.<br/>2. Talk to a confidant about the boy.<br/>3. Try to follow confidant's advice next time you're with him, but you're unable to speak up.<br/>4. Succeed at some non-boy-related challenge.*<br/>5. Be with boy again at a tense moment when your previous success is relevant, and succeed again.*<br/><b>Attainment:</b><br/>You're able to confess your feelings to the boy.<br/><b>Challenge:</b><br/>Deal with whatever boy's reaction is.<br/><br/>Clear enough what I'm looking for?<br/><br/>More examples, please. Generic as possible.<br/><br/><b>IMPORTANT EDIT:</b> I plan to use these as cards that people can have in front of them during the game, as part of the Pentasystem. My plan is to issue the Pentasystem core rules as Creative Commons-Attribution, so anything I put in it will be free-for-all and can be used in anyone's game, with acknowledgement.

The interesting thing about <i>Avatar</i> is that some characters follow the same arcs over and over again, repeating the same mistakes or at least exhibiting the same behaviors.  I think that might be important to consider.  For example, Jayne in <i>Firefly</i> is partially enjoyable because <i>he's always dealing with the same predictable issues</i>.<br/><br/>Here are my <i>Avatar</i> arcs, in your format:<br/><br/><b><i>Learn a Lesson</i></b><br/><b>Conditions</b><br/>1.

Get Over Random Hot Thing<br/><b>Attainment</b><br/>Caution, Heartbreak.<br/><b>Challenge</b><br/>Forget them and move on.  And maybe you'll encounter them later and it'll be weird.<br/><br/><b><i>More Than One Way to Skin A Cat</i></b><br/><b>Conditions</b><br/>1. Problem Encountered<br/>2.

"You now have - exactly the same challenge you had before, only bigger, but you have more resources!" would be one way to play this (kind of the D&amp;D "levelling up" way).
