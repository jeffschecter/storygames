That's cool, but I often find myself wishing for the kind of experience I sometimes get while reading evocative fiction. When I was reading Neuromancer as a kid, I didn't have any idea what was going on: stuff like character motivation and plot was completely lost on me. However, I learned to like that feeling, because I totally got Gibson's style. Visual details and associations became everything.<br/><br/>Now, I really want to get those kind of kicks from gaming. But trad games seem to care most about players beating the scenario and story games about relationships between the characters and what's happening inside their heads. It seems that even when I'm running, without any mechanical backing to create consistent imagery the plot takes over everything else in the scenario and my descriptions become rushed, as I'm trying to serve the players the plot developments they crave. <br/><br/>I think I want slower and more detailed gaming where imagery and style trump everything else.

No GM can sustain slow, vivid description if the players look bored.  <br/><br/>What's really necessary is (a) a social agreement up front that character of experience is a priority, and then (b) a system that backs that up by some combo of inspiring, prompting, requiring, and staying out of the way of fictional color.<br/><br/>I don't personally know of any systems that do this in a universal sense, but I know a few that pull it off in a specific context.  <i>Sign in Stranger</i> does alien world exploration with a great focus on environmental features, and my game <i>Delve</i> puts a "what it's like to be there" focus on medieval supernatural problem-solving.  In both cases, studying the unknown is the best way to survive and profit.<br/><br/>More often, I've seen success where a system simply gets out of the way and allows a group agreement that "detail is important" to be carried out by all the participants.  I think Vampire and Cthulhu both market an experience and are thus more conducive to "detail first" social contracts.  Then, in both games, it seems to be accepted that the GM can say "yeah, that works" or "no, it doesn't" rather than resorting to the dice at a moment when dice would be unwelcome.<br/><br/>In theory, indie games that don't invoke any mechanics until the group decides it's a dramatically satisfying moment to resolve a scene (e.g. Primetime Adventures) would be just as good for this, if not better, but I haven't seen it happen much.  Perhaps it's a difference in appeal and emphasis leading to different social contracts.  Or maybe it's just because I've had more trad than indie multi-session campaigns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360234/#Comment_360234" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T11:41:38+00:00" title="February 17, 2012 11:41AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with this, too.

I'm going to bring up the Old School Primer, so here is the <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming/3159558" rel="nofollow">free download</a>.<br/><br/>If you are playing a game that has Search skills then a roll will be made and anything "interesting" will be found if successful or not found if the roll fails. Then what happens? It depends on the system: perhaps another roll until it succeeds or not.<br/><br/>If we are playing more story games style then exploration of the fiction/environmnet once again doesn't really matter. All that matters is what we all "agree on" being awesome. And the focus is usually more on talking heads than exploring a fictional physical space.<br/><br/>Then there are games that don't have rules for exploring these fiction physical spaces, like oD&amp;D. Read the primer. The system in many ways is encouraging one to explore because that is the <i>only</i> way to receive that information. They <i>have</i> to interact with the Mysterious Moose head to find out what it is.<br/><br/>In a Story Game we would just all come to an agreement that the Mysterious Moose Head is awesome and must be a shaman's mask for worshipping the Primal Forest God and by wearing it we can... but we didn't explore the space to find this out we just decided on it.<br/><br/>So there's my musing on this.<br/><br/>EDIT: to put it all another way: skills make us lazy because we aren't encouraged to explore the fictional physical space because what one finds is dependant on that skill roll.<br/>Story Games turn the focus on "talking heads" and agreement on the fiction, so once again we can't explore the fictional space if we just agree what is there.<br/>So one would have to find a way of making this interaction with a fictional physical space fruitful. I think oD&amp;D did that pretty well. But I'd love to see a different way of making the interaction and exploration meaningful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360253/#Comment_360253" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T12:40:08+00:00" title="February 17, 2012 12:40PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe something like <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/friends/My_Daughter_The_Queen_of_France.pdf" rel="nofollow">MDQF</a>, but instead of replaying scenes where emotional content is iteratively allowed, you replay scenes where content of detail and description is iteratively allowed.<br/><br/>Scene: "Driver kills Bernie, drops the bag of money, and drives away."<br/><br/>"Hmm, let's replay that"<br/><br/>Re-scene: "Bernie follows Driver out to the car, where Driver opens the trunk, revealing the money.

What mechanical support or reward incentive can be used to encourage evocative narration (by all the players). For I've found, that like most things, practice makes perfect and most systems don't require you to make that detailed, languid description for the game to function. It makes any game sing (if that's what your group likes) but isn't part of the game. Humph. I wrote a thread about colour improvisation and evocative detail that can be 'tagged' by the mechanics on the BW forums a couple of years ago, and I still try and incorporate this approach (and encourage everyone at the table to do so!).<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.burningwheel.org/forum/showthread.php?8987-Reinforce-colour-with-mechanics&amp;highlight=colour+mechanics<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the Burning system of games was the first I'd played that seemed to encourage this sort of lyrical exposition. Folks naturally start with what something 'looks' like. But the art of asking provocative questions of each other in the 'conversation' can elucidate (and sometimes mechanically re-inforce) the fiction. Of course I've found since, that the 'World cluster of games encourage me (and the group) to focus on their narration (or story telling), since they have to start and end with the fiction. You can't just say that you do a move without authoring it into the story. FATE system games too, with their Adjectival Tags, encourage (but don't enforce) fictional supposition of the trait or skill as you add their die to your pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm with most of the other peeps here on SG - lead by example, practice a lot (even with canned text) and try and mechanically re-inforce the wonderfully immersive contributions from everyone at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360319/#Comment_360319" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T17:20:06+00:00" title="February 17, 2012  5:20PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Or just use any game that focuses on a feedback loop, like PTA's fanmail, but say that feedback is always going to be for awesomely detailed descriptions.<br/><br/>(That being said, I can't think off the top of my head of a game that also rewards the GM for their awesome descriptions.

There are some actual plays around as well.<br/><br/>The mention of <i>My Daughter, Queen of France</i> is funny to me, mostly because my previous Game Chef game (back in 2008?) -- <i>What Remains</i> -- was, like The Hydra, a direct attempt to create gameplay entirely around description and exploration of scene detail.

The whole group needs to get it, and the model of "one person claims expertise and presents the game to others" only works when those others are in fact noobs with no expectations.  With a group of folks who've played different games, it needs to be made crystal clear that a commitment to detail is part of the group purpose of play and not merely one dude's taste or opinion.<br><br>With Ted, I tried to forge that social agreement, but it was clearly just my taste/opinion.

That doesn't mean that every rules statement contains all the required description. It just means that (in my experience) talking about rules results in less jarring breaks from dialogue and description since you can do a little bit of both at once. (I have been wanting to say this for a couple of days but had to wait till I had something to link to.)<br/><br/>The other thing I've been thinking about in terms of descriptive sequences is that long GM monologues tend to make players feel distant from their situation - like they're reading or watching a film. So to make games that are descriptive <i>as games</i>, the description must be in terms of a game element or event. For example, telling players it's cold does little to convey that it's cold. A brilliant description will make it clear, but it's best conveyed by having them interact with the cold. If it's really cold, perhaps it limits the player character's recovery rate, for example. Or distracts them during combat unless they've got warm clothes.

Great point!<br/><br/>I don't think it's always possible (or desirable) to include a character-success-based incentive (e.g. recovery rate, combat distraction) for every detail you want to describe, but poking stuff is definitely better than staring at it.<br/><br/>Of course, if you include interactive stuff that <i>doesn't</i> have tangible impact, you damn sure better have a way to communicate to the players that they can move on and aren't missing a key or clue or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360677/#Comment_360677" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T01:26:29+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  1:26AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right. Phrasing interactive bits correctly is important. Not just in the sense of verbal phrasing but also in game terms - the way play leads up to them, how they work, etc. One way to do this is to include sections of the game that exist only to prove a point about the environment. These can be puzzles, challenges, fights, conversations with people or anything else, but they exist to achieve your descriptive or tonal goals. Having to swim through goop without getting it all through your stuff, for example, makes players aware of the omnipresence of goop in your goop dungeon. Stopping to cough and having impaired perception from the dust you kick up when you push open the trapdoor makes Grandma's Attic seem dusty in a way that seeing the dust doesn't. So yeah, they don't have to be the primary object of the interaction to become part of the interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360678/#Comment_360678" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T01:49:05+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  1:49AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find FATE's environmental Aspects can help a scene cook with gas.  One, it keeps with Thor's/Judd's rule of three (Thor and Judd are the ones I learned it from)... I never use more than three and sometimes less.  Two, it encourages the interaction with said elements in a game mechanical way.  Three, it encourages the party to come up with more environmental Aspects organically IF needed.  <br/><br/>Four, it is descriptive shorthand, quick and fast and then gets out of the way.  I totally agree with what Biggles said about too much description leads to distance from the game.  I've experienced this myself with GMs who are overly descriptive.  Partly, this is my own nature to blame... I'm highly visual and am a visual problem solver (I'm a professional artist)... and I get word images in my mind in less than a second.  I don't need someone explaining more and more to me.  Not only can it get boring, but the longer it goes on, the more chance it can <b>disrupt</b> my visualization of the scene, which then boots me out of the immersive frame of mind and I have to go "hey, what?" and try to negotiate the two visions into a useful whole.  <br/><br/>One trick I use is to be VERY clear about what is description for description's sake.  When it isn't a clue.  So the players are not wondering and spending energy on trying to interpret my wording as the keys to the scene.  If they players still want to explore some little nugget I dropped in passing... GREAT!!!  Let's do that!  It can lead to some awesome scenes and role-playing.  But I don't want them to feel obligated to do so.  So, "Two men arguing in the corner as you enter the tavern" will be followed up by me breaking the fourth wall and saying; "the argument is just color. "  Which is our group's shorthand for <i>you don't have to go over there and break it up or listen or anything, it is just to give some life to the tavern.  But if you WANT to take a interest in it, cool. </i><br/><br/>And yeah, I use and I like lots of pictures for gaming.  Great for getting everyone on the same page.  I also do online Maptool's gaming with some real lovers of minis (2 of the 3 players) and they love the various icons and maps I find.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360685/#Comment_360685" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T03:35:01+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  3:35AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool discussion here.

Literally nothing happens other than four lines of dialogue -- and the rules explicitly tell you not to have significant time pass between each line. The average in-fiction length of a scene is presumably something like twenty seconds. However, despite these limitations, players could theoretically take an infinite amount of time to play out the scene: whenever it is your turn, you can either add a piece of physical/sensory description to the scene, or (if you haven't spoken last) speak a line of dialogue. As mentioned, you only get two lines of dialogue, but you can add as many pieces of description as you want. Since dialogue is expensive and description is free, players are encouraged to build up description as a way of exploring and evoking tone &amp; meaning -- and also to provide crucial context for the dialogue. <br/><br/>While the initial tendency is to rely on the dialogue to reveal the most important elements of the characters' relationship -- while using the description to add emotional and aesthetic tone -- over time these roles tend to blend together. It's like collaborating on a mash-up between a collection of old photographs and a Raymond Carver short story.<br/><br/>In <i>What Remains</i>, much like <i>A Penny For My Thoughts</i>, you are performing a sort of archeological dig of the past; unlike Penny, this happens through the frame of a place, rather than a person. Players collaborate to create a location and then slowly fill that location with objects. Each object is a storehouse for memories, and all of play consists of describing the details of these objects and the details of the memories connected to them. As players add description to an object, it becomes heavier, more real -- which is important, because the location is very windy, and everything is in danger of blowing away. These are mechanical concepts.<br/><br/>Evocative description is rewarded by permanence: if you describe interesting details then other players are more likely to add their own elaborations, and so your contributions are more likely to survive the wind. The more often a memory is revisited the more detailed it becomes.<br/><br/>In <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i>, characters have specific aesthetic motifs -- scenery, objects, locations, colours, clothing, etc. -- that provide them with benefits when incorporated into their descriptions of wuxia kung-fu fights. Furthermore, the fights themselves are entirely descriptive in character -- the players who are involved in the kung-fu take turns describing how awesome they are, and the rest of the players pass silent judgment on who they think is winning. In my experience, the motifs help provide structure to what is otherwise a relatively freeform descriptive exercise, rewarding players for keeping the concrete details of the scene in mind even as they attempt to one-up each other within that larger context.<br/><br/>All of these games achieve descriptive richness in a fairly obvious, explicit way: they make 'describe sensory details' into a specific type of player action that is necessary in order to play the game. They then support that request by providing a framework to the player, generally by providing concrete limitations/specific suggestions as to what sort of description might be appropriate -- and also focusing heavily on listening to and reincorporating the descriptive details provided by other players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_361570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361570/#Comment_361570" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T03:23:04+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  3:23AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite>I think I want slower and more detailed gaming where imagery and style trump everything else.

It's a great part of my immersion in the character.<br/><br/>I believe you are right when pinpointing "slower" as a quality in such gaming, or a premise. We need to slow down, and let the interaction dip into mellow scenes close to sleep. Doing that we may rediscover the magic of building situation with smells, sounds and emotional states.<br/><br/>Try gaming a drama with no purpose; everyday life in some corner of the world where nothing happens, nothing but simple life. Go into insignificant characters and seek out their small happiness.

Obviously this isn't what you mean!<br/><br/>When I'm GMing story games, I find myself so wrapped up in plot and hitting flags that it is hard - two things I've found help me bring in more description.<br/><br/>1. I delegate description to players.  For their own successes for sure, but also things they encounter.  I'm not consistent with it, but I get some breathing room if I'm worrying about plot, and they get to exercise their creative muscles.<br/><br/>2. I pre-generate fragments of color, little dynamics or natural trends that I can graft in wherever they fit.  Rather than focus on the details, I determine the underlying trend, say, agriculture being disrupted by a superstition, randomly pick a sense that the players would perceive this through.  That last bit adds a surprising amount of crispness to the concept, which would otherwise remain abstract.  Smell - for example, takes me to the idea that crops are being burned sacrificially, or that there's an over-abundance of a nutritionally useless but fragrant herb.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362165/#Comment_362165" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T23:50:57+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 11:50PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><br/><br/>In<i>The Hydra</i>, individual scenes are frozen time.

They then support that request by providing a framework to the player, generally by providing concrete limitations/specific suggestions as to what sort of description might be appropriate -- and also focusing heavily on listening to and reincorporating the descriptive details provided by other players.</blockquote>\nThanks, that was helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362228/#Comment_362228" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T02:23:34+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  2:23AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 2:25AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.  <i>Hydra</i> and <i>What Remains</i> sound very cool.

Thoughts?</blockquote>\nThis was one of my goals as well with my gothic horror game <a href="http://www.findannalise.com" rel="nofollow">Annalise</a>. Creation and, even more importantly to me, reintegration of specific colorful details is something I really like in my play. There's explicit support for this in the game, through a system I called "Claims", where you basically write down ephemera that other people say, and then can bring in those details later to help you out. People who have played the game seem pretty into them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Transneptune Games review</cite>Claims are just beautiful. Completely wonderful. I want to use them in everything now. Basically, when someone else introduces some fictional element, you can claim it (sometimes for free, sometimes for a cost), and then you are the arbiter of that motif. You can mention its inclusion in someone else\u2019s scene, you can use it to fiddle with the dice, and you must also keep an eye out for when and where it would be good to introduce. This really helps encourage powerful and gothic motifs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Geekbuffet review</cite>Players can \u201cclaim\u201d non-player characters, props, locations, visual motifs, relationships and events introduced by other players as bits of fiction they control.  Shadowy dogs, bodiless limbs, Frank\u2019s uncle, the oncoming storm, tapping fingernails; the cheap tropes list is nigh inexhaustible. This is the players\u2019 way of telling the others: \u201cThat thing you came up with was so awesome, it\u2019s got to come up again!\u201d  These Claims then help you out later in the game, ensuring their recurrence in the story as well as a useful game boost.</blockquote>\nThe basic mechanical idea is pretty easily integrated into other games, if you want to try it, I think. When another player says something you think is cool, and you want to see again later, write it down on a piece of paper and put a token or die on it. Later, spend the token or die to help you out in some resolution roll, by describing how that thing matters to the situation at hand. Adjust quantity of tokens and frequency of being able to claim things as suits the game and group in question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362317/#Comment_362317" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T09:36:24+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  9:36AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Annalise is really effective for this, and it has a very strong design choice that makes the color <em>matter to the players:</em> selective reincorporation.</p>\n<p>As players, you get really powerful social feedback for introducing an intriguing, on-tone detail: the moment where it's Claimed by another player. Then <em>both players</em> get reinforcement when the Claim is reused later - the creator gets to see his idea adopted and run with, and the other player draws dice from it which allow him to advance his goals. Claims that turn out to be less interesting or fitting get used <em>less,</em> but they still start off with that burst of positive feedback. (It turns out that Nathan is a really good game designer ^_^ )</p>\n<p>Something I like to do when I'm playing a game that doesn't have mechanical description support is to think about information I want to impart to the players, and use description to <em>show</em> it instead of <em>telling</em> it in exposition. Like, here's three contrasted descriptions:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>A woman walks into the offices. You recognize her as Lady Rothny from the noble House of Orskel. She seems worried that she is being followed.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>A woman walks into the offices. It's Lady Rothny from the House of Orskel - today she's wearing layers and layers, coat upon coat, because it's so chilly outside, and the mud on her slippers obscures their fine leatherwork. Her mink-fur cap is slightly askew, and her chestnut-brown hair is disheveled. She shuts the door behind her with exaggerated care.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>A chestnut-haired woman slips into the offices, looking nervously behind her. She is tightly bundled in layers of brightly-colored wools, and the collars of her coat have embroidered crests featuring a golden orskel - this must be the Lady Rothny Orskel (she is famous for her hair). Her fine slippers are covered in mud - they will never be the same again. Her wide-eyed tension doesn't fade until she closes the door completely and the latch clicks shut.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Here you see three approaches to introduce the same character. In the first, there is no attempt to build a visual narrative at all - you just get white spaces with noun labels. The second gives you a lot of visual information, but it doesn't tell you anything <em>relevant about the character.</em> It's all visual crap you don't care about.</p>\n<p>The third description is all <em>motivated showing.</em> Every detail there indicates something that you can know or conclude, about the character or her current mental state. You gather quickly that she's upset, maybe concerned that she's being followed, sacrificed a pair of nice shoes to come here on foot, it's cold outside, and you <em>experience the process of identifying her</em> based on visual cues. You never get the opportunity to visualize empty cutouts because you get visuals every step of the way. You need to plan a little to do this, until you're used to it, but it's a very useful method.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362463/#Comment_362463" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T15:14:45+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  3:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>A woman walks into the offices</blockquote>\nYes.

You can just as easily motivate a Claim by coming up with compelling facts, events, and story fodder, as by being colorful.  Maybe <i>more</i> easily.  <br/><br/>"And there's a mysterious guy exiting the chief's office!" works as well or better than "The office reeks of old cigarette smoke, the plaster on the ceiling has peeled in little circles, and you see the head of an ancient typewriter peeking out of an awkward-fitting box in the corner," right?<br/><br/>Folks who've actually played it a bunch, is that accurate?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I think it's cool, but I'm fuzzy on how it addresses the "slow down and give us some detail" issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

And then Michael sat there for an equivalent amount of time, and came back with another short sentence, etc. There's really nothing else going on in the game, other than this slowly-built descriptive scene, mentally suspended between the two players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362483/#Comment_362483" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T15:57:03+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  3:57PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ndp</cite>here's explicit support for this in the game, through a system I called "Claims", where you basically write down ephemera that other people say, and then can bring in those details later to help you out.</blockquote>\nThis sounds excellent -- it also reminds me a bit of a game I read (but never played) awhile back called <i>Covenant</i>, where specific apocalyptic groups within the game (which was all about these apocalyptic cults, after the apocalypse failed to show up) had visual motifs that they were rewarded for incorporating into scene descriptions. It's probably actually closer to the personal motifs of Mist-Robed Gate, now that I think about it. The ability of players to elevate in-game description by 'claiming' it sounds like an excellent variation -- vs. coming up with the motifs during character/situation generation.

Like, in most games, if I bring a desire for color, and the other 3 people don't, then there's not much I can do but hope to inspire someone.  But in Annalise, my odds are a little better, with folks having to parse my colorful babble for Claim fodder, and then seeing color as an option themselves when they're narrating and at a loss for grabby events.
