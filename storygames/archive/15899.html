I love some of these too much. What's your favorite, and what are you going to do about it?<br/><br/><b>I MARRIED AN ARMENIAN:</b> Said matter-of-factly to us by a woman publicist. Stanley thought it a great title for a 1940s-style Warner Bros. musical.<br/><br/><b>IF ONLY THE F\xdcHRER KNEW!:</b> This was a common saying in Germany in the 1930s whenever something went wrong or somebody did something wrong. Used mockingly with the eyes looking upwards.<br/><br/><b>HOT SHEETS, LEG CANDY, LEG MAGIC, FEEL TIGHT, PARTITION MAGIC: </b>Five vehicles for Sharon Stone. Partition Magic was the name of a software package in the days of DOS that almost allowed you to run two programs concurrently.<br/><b><br/>ONLY MINISTERS OF THE THIRD REICH MAY USE GREEN INK:</b> Stanley read somewhere that this was, in fact, true. He thought it would make a great art house double bill with Wim Wender\u2019s 1971 film, The Goalie\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick.<br/><br/><b>COFFIN NOT INCLUDED:</b> A 1940s noir thriller. When I was researching props for the morgue scene in Eyes Wide Shut I had a catalogue from a company that supplied funeral parlour equipment. One of the illustrations showed a bier with a coffin on it. The caption read: \u201cThe Excelsior Bier (coffin not included.)\u201d<br/><br/><b>DR STRANGLE-GLOVE: </b>Stanley\u2019s title misunderstood by a switchboard operator at Shepperton Studios while he was making the film.<br/><br/><b>OSMIROID AND OBLIVION and OTHER BARRELS, OTHER NIBS:</b> Two art house films about European writers. Lots of sensitivity, lots of angst. Osmiroid made some of Stanley\u2019s favourite fountain pens. Oskar Werner in the lead?)<br/><br/><b>TWIG THE ENHANCER:</b> Heroic quest and Tolkien-type fantasy. Stanley\u2019s house was in a sink as regards mobile phone reception, so, the company put in an enhancer to boost reception and transmission. After a few weeks it went down. An engineer turned up and fixed it. We asked him what he had done. He replied, \u201cI had to twig the enhancer.\u201d<br/><br/><b>NIGHTCLUBS, MORGUES, HOSPITAL:</b> A comedy with Steve Martin.<br/><br/><b>IN THE PENILE COLONY:</b> Not penal \u2026 Kafka meets Marilyn Chambers?<br/><br/><b>ONE BAG, ONE NOTEBOOK:</b> Art house angst, Oskar Werner again.<br/><br/><b>THE WIZARD OF AUSCHWITZ: </b>A concentration camp film with a feel-good ending.<br/><br/><b>AUSCHWITZ AND ME!:</b> A musical. The follow-up to Springtime for Hitler?<br/><br/><b>SHARP SHADOW ON THE WALL:</b> Arty noir film set in the 1940s with not a lot happening.<br/><br/><b>THE TWO WALLYS:</b> From Wally Veevers and Wally Gentleman, two of the SFX supervisors on 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br/><br/><b>SIGHT GAGS FOR PERVERTS:</b> How Dr. Strangelove was described on its release in a review in the Bulletin of the American Film Institute! Stanley cherished this.<br/><br/><b>SOME LIKE IT COLD and JACK THE SNIFFER:</b> An intriguing double-bill for forensic science buffs.<br/><br/><b>SPEAKING ALARMS:</b> Low budget Brit film seen by nobody.<br/><br/><b>KIRA THE KARAOKE GIRL:</b> A low budget art house film from somewhere in the Balkans. Lots of tears. Depressing ending.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361147/#Comment_361147" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T12:25:33+00:00" title="February 21, 2012 12:25PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glorious.
