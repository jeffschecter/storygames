And of course, comments and questions are always welcome. <br/><br/>Fabricated Realities 2012, Saturday the 16th of June, 2:00 \u2013 5:30<br/><br/>This session was handily facilitated by Caroline. She graciously let me be Shakespeare. I had only been Shakespeare once before, in my first game. It\u2019s great to let someone who has played before be Shakespeare so they can work on filling out their questions while the facilitator explains the rules to everyone else.<br/><br/>We decided that this would be played in modern times. We allowed no table talk and were careful in enforcing it. I explained to players before the game that sometimes I would seem curt.  We took two 10 minute breaks. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383687/#Comment_383687" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T23:14:35+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 11:14PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2012 11:27PM by Mathalus.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shakespeare\u2019s Questions</span></b><br/>Morgan, played previously \u2013 <b>William Shakespeare</b>, 56, playwright and father<br/><br/>I had already typed up answers to Shakespeare\u2019s questions. I had been carrying this around for a couple months, since I noticed that Shakespeare gets to immediately start filling out questions without input from others.<br/><br/> In prior games it seems that the majority want to blame Shakespeare for bad parenting and the strain on the relationship. Of course, it takes two to estrange, but even when the daughter is old enough to make sound decisions, the parent always gets judged more harshly. I think the friend\u2019s questions are skewed this way, which is great. However, I wanted to break that. I mean, I know I did the right thing.<br/><br/>The answers to the questions on my sheet revealed that my 25 year old daughter, Genevieve, was usually truthful to a fault. However, her step-mother, Melinda, caught her stealing the presents from under the Christmas tree and loading them into her car. I had pressed charges and Genevieve was awaiting sentencing. I didn\u2019t reveal until the end that my secret hope was for her to be safe, and since it would always be my job to protect her, that it might be best for her to straighten out in rehab and jail.<br/><br/>She was old enough to know better, but had made a choice which should be reviled. I was certain my drastic action would be justified and my friends could help me discover what was at the root of her terrible crime.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shakespeare\u2019s Friends Questions</span></b><br/>Caroline, facilitator, played previously \u2013 <b>Angela Shakespeare</b>, 43, ex-wife of Shakespeare<br/>We learned that Genevieve\u2019s mother writes letters to her daughter and that they are getting closer. She also felt that Shakespeare is right about Genevieve\u2019s habit of truthfulness and that she is only confused and lonely. In her opinion, her friends are incapable of being bad, if they were to cross her, they were not her friends to begin with and Shakespeare is shortsighted, hot tempered and brash.<br/><br/>Jess, played previously \u2013 <b>Oliver Bell</b>, actor and prot\xe9g\xe9 of Shakespeare<br/>(Jess, I don't have your answers sheet. Help me fill this in.)<br/><br/>Noah, a new player \u2013 <b>Vincent Price</b>, public attorney for Genevieve the first time<br/>Vincent always took Genevieve\u2019s side and believed her incapable of doing wrong. (Noah, I don't have your answer sheet either. Help me fill this in.)<br/><br/>Dana, a new player \u2013 <b>Embeth Marlowe</b>, 40, friend of the family. <br/>Embeth and Shakespeare are friends since he thinks that her husband, Chris Marlowe, is his greatest rival. In fact, Chris Marlowe is a worthless drunk and she writes all his material using his name. Embeth has grown closer to Genevieve recently. She feels that the young woman is looking for guidance, but that Shakespeare is deceived about Genevieve\u2019s true nature. Embeth knows that a true friend is supportive, but thinks that Shakespeare is pathetic and grasping for fame at the cost of family. He\u2019s neglected Genevieve, while she lavishes attention on her own 25 year old daughter. <br/><br/>Marc, played previously \u2013 <b>Constance Trudeau</b>, 25, daughter of family friends<br/>Genevieve\u2019s best friend from boarding school had an awkward teenage fromance, but were friends afterward. They have been out of touch recently, but went to visit her. Constance feels that it is important to console your friends. She knows Shakespeare as a hard-headed traditionalist, who can\u2019t see anything but his own way. She doesn\u2019t have children, but thinks it must be hell to have a daughter.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Characters who were not also actors</span></b><br/><b>Genevieve Shakespeare</b>, my daughter<br/><b>Phill</b>, Angela\u2019s new partner<br/><b>Chris Marlowe</b>, Embeth\u2019s sot of a husband<br/><b>Melinda Shakespeare</b>, my current wife.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383688/#Comment_383688" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T23:16:57+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 11:16PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenes</span></b><br/>Scenes are recorded as I have them in front of me, having been played through many times. I have them mostly in the order they first appeared. I have listed how many times they were played when it is apparent from the limits. If they are all crossed off, I wrote \u201cno limits\u201d and it can be assumed that they were played 4-6 times. <br/><br/><b>The Estrangement</b> \u2013 No limits<br/>Shakespeare visits Genevieve in custody.<br/>A small room, poorly lit room, inside the local jailhouse.<br/>Shakespeare, Angela, Genevieve and Vincent<br/>Turn of Phrase, Shakespeare, \u201cYou\u2019re cut off.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Genevieve, \u201cI don\u2019t even care anymore. Dad doesn\u2019t even want me around.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Angela, \u201cYou\u2019re and uncaring man, as you were an uncaring husband.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Vincent, \u201cDo you want to explain why you took the presents?\u201d<br/>Emotional State, Angela, Outraged<br/>Turn of Phrase, Angela, \u201cGet out of here, you bastard.\u201d<br/><br/>We start with the estrangement of course. Mostly Angela uses this scene as an opportunity to bludgeon me. We play this scene many times and I often let others add certainties, however they mostly use it to wallow in Genevieve\u2019s grief instead of constructively getting to the root of our problem. Finally, Vincent playing himself says something useful, so I make sure to add that as a certainty, but his question never really gets answered here. Too many variables.<br/><br/><b>8 years before Estrangement</b> \u2013 No Limits<br/>The confrontation at school. Oliver\u2019s last conversation with Genevieve<br/>Constance\u2019s room at boarding school.<br/>Oliver, Genevieve and Constance<br/>Turn of Phrase, Oliver, \u201cYou have a problem, Genevieve.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Constance, \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t even be here.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Constance, \u201cFuck you, Gennie. <br/><br/>This scene is uniformly terrible, though it is the first time we see Genevieve\u2019s drug use. Her relationship with Oliver is cast in a vile light. Some people\u2019s imaginations.<br/><br/><b>4 years before Estrangement</b> \u2013 Done twice.<br/>Genevieve asks for a loan<br/>Phill\u2019s Apartment<br/>Angela, Phill, Genevieve<br/>Turn of Phrase, Phill, \u201cYou\u2019re not getting a thing.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Angela, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of creepy.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Angela, \u201cHow many times have you been here?\u201d<br/><br/>I establish this scene to remind everyone how often we had tried to help Genevieve already.<br/><br/><b>2 Years before Estrangement</b> \u2013 Done once.<br/>Melinda and Shakespeare confront Genevieve<br/>Outside the police station<br/>Melinda, Shakespeare, Genevieve<br/>Turn of Phrase, Melinda, \u201cWe\u2019re here to help.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Shakespeare, \u201cIt has to happen now.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Melinda, \u201cYou look \u2026 uhhh.\u201d<br/><br/>Angela tells me off at a high volume and quits right about here. I don\u2019t let her tantrum stop me. Instead of acknowledging her, I simply establish the next scene. <br/><br/><br/><b>3 Years before Estrangement</b> \u2013 Done once.<br/>Genevieve is admitting her drug problem. <br/>Psychic City coffee shop. <br/>Constance, Genevieve<br/>Turn of Phrase, Constance, \u201cI can\u2019t help you.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Constance, \u201cI\u2019ll bet he was pissed.\u201d<br/><br/>It\u2019s obvious that Genevieve had a drug problem. I want to establish a scene that says so, so we can stop flopping around with other theories. <br/><br/><b>6 years before the Estrangement</b> \u2013 Done once.<br/>Genevieve gets caught<br/>At the Marlowe\u2019s<br/>Embeth, Chris, Genevieve<br/>Turn of Phrase, Embeth, \u201cI\u2019m going to call the cops.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Chris, \u201cWhy is she still here?\u201d<br/><br/>Embeth and Oliver quit about here. Embeth even has the gall to say that I am chasing after fame instead of my family. But the whole reason I\u2019m doing this is my family. <br/><br/><b>10 years before Estrangement</b> \u2013 Done three times.<br/>First day of school<br/>New dorm room<br/>Constance, Genevieve<br/>Turn of Phrase, Genevieve, \u201cMy father is a great man.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Constance, \u201cThose plays are sweet.\u201d<br/><br/>With only Constance and Vincent left, I go back very early to see if we can get something out of her. Mostly they just talk about popular music and other garbage. I\u2019ll try something else. <br/><br/><b>12 years before Estrangement</b> \u2013 No limits<br/>Helping Genevieve with her homework<br/>Shakespeare and Genevieve<br/>Turn of Phrase, Shakespeare, \u201cYou\u2019re so smart and capable.\u201d<br/>Turn of Phrase, Shakespeare, \u201cI\u2019m not a magician I\u2019m a hard worker.\u201d<br/><br/>I like this scene. We play it several times, in quick succession. I don\u2019t believe in letting a wrong scene continue too long. Quality or brevity. This scene really shows how good our relationship was. Constance leaves about here. Only Vincent is left.<br/><br/><b>1 day before the estrangement</b> \u2013 No limits<br/>Genevieve looking into the mirror<br/>At her apartment, in the bathroom<br/>Genevieve<br/>Turn of Phrase, Genevieve, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br/><br/>I\u2019m running out of actors and am forced to do a scene with just one character. However, even Vincent won\u2019t see it through to the end as he quits after several iterations of this scene. That\u2019s fine, I think I\u2019m almost there, and at least we won\u2019t have any more distractions. <br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alone</span></b><br/>From this point on I was simply establishing scenes with no one to play them.<br/><br/><b>25 years before Estrangement</b> \u2013 Established, not played<br/>The day Genevieve is born<br/>At Swedish hospital.<br/>Shakespeare, Angela, Genevieve<br/>Turn of Phrase, Shakespeare, \u201cI will always love and protect you.\u201d<br/><br/><b>11 years before Estrangement</b> \u2013 Established, not played<br/>Angela and Shakespeare are arguing, while Genevieve listens from nearby room.<br/>At the Shakespeares\u2019<br/>Angela, Shakespeare, Genevieve<br/>Turn of Phrase, Angela, \u201cI\u2019m leaving you.\u201d<br/><br/><b>5 years before Estrangement</b> - Established, not played<br/>Shakespeare is on the phone with his producer.<br/>At his home office<br/>Shakespeare<br/>Turn of Phrase, Shakespeare, \u201cWhat do you mean they won\u2019t finance it?\u201d<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383689/#Comment_383689" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-27T23:18:13+00:00" title="June 27, 2012 11:18PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discussion</span></b><br/>Please, anyone who was there, I\u2019d love your impressions, corrections (I\u2019ll amend the above), and input on anything you\u2019d like to contribute.

He is already estranged from his own family.<br/><br/>For me, this game was an object lesson in being specific. I said that Oliver had once been very close to Genevieve, but had mysteriously not been speaking to her for "a while". (ETA: Because they had a secret relationship and a bad breakup, which I kept secret from the other players.) In my mind, that while was months, not 8 years, especially since I had already said (out loud, even!) that Oliver had only known Shakespeare for 6-7 years. <br/><br/>However, in the very first scene after we played the estrangement, Shakespeare framed me into a situation where I'm sneaking into her boarding school 8 years ago, which was also the time when Gen and I fell out. So right away I am suddenly creepy statutory-rape guy. I sorta sat back and didn't grab a character in the scene the first time or two that we played it, and by that time it was established that Oliver's rapeyness was more than the 'statutory' variety. About the only thing I could do at this point was to play Gen in the scene in such a way that she enthusiastically embraced whatever relationship we had. It also turned out that this was the only scene with Oliver in it, so that was the only information we got about his character.<br/><br/>This re-characterisation threw me off quite a bit for most of the game. I managed to talk myself out of being mad about it (hey, I wasn't nearly clear enough in the first place, and besides which, just because Shakespeare says that's how we fell out, doesn't mean that actually was how we fell out), but rethinking my character on the fly, while playing other people's characters, unmoored me from any strong feelings I had about Shakespeare, Genevieve, and their estrangement, so I found it really hard to show Oliver as having any point of view about the characters he was playing.<br/><br/>Conclusion?

I thought I was clear about your character, but didn't ask. On top of that, the "no table talk" rule that really stymies on the spot corrections. I think you were rightfully ticked, because your contribution to the game had just been stepped on. All of this is further muddied by the fact that the scenes that we are making up don't actually reflect the "reality" of our shared fiction. This improvisational play has poetic license. So it's possible to create scenes that are against the stated facts, but this is a difficult move. And it's one that should be done knowingly, instead of me blindly stumbling onto it.<br/><br/>Do you think an explicit caveat to the "no table talk" rule is a solution? What if we said, "You can't talk as your actor, unless you think that Shakespeare is forgetting an established fact. You can warn Shakespeare of this, but he can still put forward the scene."<br/><br/>I like the ability to point something out to Shakespeare, and then let him recognize it, and plow ahead anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cyndisision" title="cyndisision"><img alt="cyndisision" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mediacdn.disqus.com/uploads/users/700/7740/avatar92.jpg?1299211455"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cyndisision">cyndisision</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383787/#Comment_383787" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T15:51:39+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  3:51PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with all of that analysis (though I do think more transparency in character creation could help).

Note that <i>breaks </i>is a different word than <i>changes</i>.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that a line should have been drawn, just reminding that it exists as an option. If an idea in the story makes participation not fun or rewarding for you, it's a good candidate for being veiled/lined/reworked.<br/><br/>This gets complicated by the fact that My Daughter, Queen of France is a game <i>about</i> frustration and strained communication, sure.

E.g. it addresses them both as 'you'.<br/><br/>So in theory there are a lot of different ways of treating the un-explicitly-discussed possibilities of communication (Shakespeare and the friends talk about baseball; the friends talk to each other about their lives outside the play; the players kibbitz about whatever; etc.) <br/><br/>I think that because the non-communication about the play is important, and by itself tends to create a sense of isolation between S. and his friends, that lots of players find it natural to just extend that absence of communication to most other parts of the game. But I do agree that this should always be limited to <i>parts of the game</i> -- i.e. the limits, insofar as they are presented as 'how to play the game', should govern only friend/Shakespeare-level interaction. <br/><br/>If that spills over to how the players interact in an organic fashion, then cool -- that's something that I think has happened so often in the past that for some it is part of the game's play-culture. But I wouldn't recommend presenting it as 'this game doesn't allow table talk' -- better to be clear about what you can't talk about, and then (if you want) suggest that the group try to avoid lots of player-level kibbitzing and table-talk. That last step is not really part of the game, it's just part of how a particular group of people might want to play the game.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I will hopefully be adding something to the final version of the game that explicitly talks about in-character talk between Shakespeare's Friends (I want there to be more of it, generally), but I don't really feel the need to address how much general player table-talk there should or should not be -- I feel like that's really up to each individual group, their preferences, the specifics of the play they end up telling, etc.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383809/#Comment_383809" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T17:55:19+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  5:55PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is there really a "no table talk" rule?

We didn't talk about the play, I don't think (though I don't remember anyone telling us we weren't allowed to), but mostly about each other and our personal lives. There were some occasional comments during the scenes (I remember Johnstone saying about somebody else's take on Guildenstern, "Man, I am such a dick," and Ross-as-Prospero being briefly muttery about how others were playing him), but it didn't seem to distract from play and wasn't a constant thing.<br/><br/>Joe, I'd love to have that conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cyndisision" title="cyndisision"><img alt="cyndisision" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mediacdn.disqus.com/uploads/users/700/7740/avatar92.jpg?1299211455"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cyndisision">cyndisision</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383832/#Comment_383832" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T20:27:09+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  8:27PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was sort of afraid that I'd made this thread all about me, but it's actually turned into quite an interesting conversation.

I don't have any absolute prohibition against playing a predator or otherwise squicky character, and this group was certainly a group I could feel OK doing that with, but it was more than just having my contribution stepped on. The mental shift required to go from "okay human being with relationship hangups" specifically to "creepy rape guy with drug problems" proved too much for me to do mid-game. I thought about veiling, but I felt it was too strong a move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383833/#Comment_383833" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T20:32:35+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  8:32PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think playing one of Shakespeare's friends as a character, especially when doing the initial line readings, and adding a bit of in-character dialogue between the friends really elevates the game -- provided it doesn't get in the way of actually playing the scenes.<br/><br/>Also, if you keep things about your character secret, then the other players can't react to them. If you have <i><i>anything</i></i> on your sheet that another character would know, <i>tell that player</i>. Like, when we played, I just said Guildenstern was in an indie theatre company with S's daughter. I didn't share his opinion of the situation, but it wasn't anything unusual. Jamie, though, playing Rosencrantz, wrote that we had a three-way with S's daughter on E and felt bad about it after, and he made sure I was cool with that. So when it came up during a scene (with me playing his character and he playing mine), I wasn't completely gobsmacked, but everybody else was. It was great!<br/><br/>Dunno if there needs to be (or if there is already) something about that in the text, but I would recommend players being clear about anything/everything they want to be in the game for sure, like being estranged for only months, not years. Get that stuff out in the open.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383835/#Comment_383835" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T20:36:58+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  8:36PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The mental shift required to go from "okay human being with relationship hangups" specifically to "creepy rape guy with drug problems" proved too much for me to do mid-game.

Like, you address S. as your character and say, "look dude, maybe you think I'm the creepy rape+drug guy, but it's not like that." Or even by choosing to play yourself in a scene and doing the same thing, only saying it to another character in the scene?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383839/#Comment_383839" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T21:27:43+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  9:27PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>There definitely needs to more direct advice about how/what gets shared during the initial setup. The revised question sheets I brought to FabReal had slightly-clearer text, but so far all of the 'do I reveal or not?' stuff is filtered through what Shakespeare would know. I don't want players to tell Shakespeare stuff about his friends that he would not know -- which makes it difficult for them to share things with each other that they would know, but Shakespeare would not, such as the whole three-way-on-ecstasy type deal. Including advice about note-passing, etc. among friends is probably a good idea.<br/><br/>But of course in general I am still struggling with the right balance between the various elements of the game -- in this case, between Shakespeare-and-his-daughter and Shakespeare's-friends-as-interesting-people-in-of-themselves. Most of us are very used to playing games where the character we are playing is the most important thing we have to bring to the game -- but this isn't like that. That urge is super-helpful to what the game is about, but as Joe alluded to it is not helpful because I want to fulfill it, but because frustrating it is itself part of what the game is about.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
