I loved it. We ALL loved the game. And then I studied the scenarios, the interaction, and a sick idea sprang into my mind: how about designing a Fiasco scenario set during a big gaming convention? You get to see lots of weird people there.  Maybe you're one of them. Again, weird. And, even if these con are no Woodstock or Glastonbury, there is certainly something "interesting" going on...especially after the midnight hour. <br/><br/>So I wrote this hack -- in Italian, first. It's been well-received, alas I didn't get to play it yet. <br/><br/>In an unusual fit of hubris, I decided to translate it in English. <a href="http://www.roleplaying.it/2010/01/fiascon-in-english.html" rel="nofollow">it's here</a>, hope you like it.<br/><br/>PS: The Klingon Battlesword mentioned there has been borrowed directly from the Rock Band scenario :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253935/#Comment_253935" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T11:26:36+00:00" title="January 30, 2010 11:26AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "A D20 made of hash"<br/><br/>This playset is obviously made of LOVE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253937/#Comment_253937" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-30T11:38:04+00:00" title="January 30, 2010 11:38AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great! One thing I hope to see - that you've already caught on to - is building a little fun continuity into different playsets. So the shopping mall set that will be the playset of the month for November exists in the same place as the suburbs set in the book, and there's some crossover of setting elements. Hopefully you can bounce from one to another, maybe elevating minor characters in one to the protagonists of the next. There's no reason the big gaming convention couldn't dovetail nicely with other contemporary ones as well.<br/><br/>Well done!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254731/#Comment_254731" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T08:28:42+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  8:28AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2010 8:30AM by David Artman.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll admit I didn't have time to peruse (let alone proof) but a couple of points:<br/>* It's "Airsoft," if you mean the plastic-pellet-shooting guns.<br/>* Most of the Relationships are not one-to-one (see all of "Your Party"). As I understand Fiasco setup, a Relationship is between two characters (whose players are sitting adjacent to each other), NOT the whole PC group and not an individual (e.g. most of your "RPG Shop" folks). But maybe you know that and it's just a translation/use-of-plural confusion?<br/>* The Needs, Objects, and Locations are supposed to expand upon the Relationship to which each is attached. So... how does my "very, very bad dog" expand upon my "old bikers approaching Gygax's age" Relationship with Bob? (OK, I could tease something out of that, but I hope you follow my point.)<br/><br/>All that said... AWESOME! You're the first (non-invited) creator of a Fiasco Playset, from what I've seen!<br/><br/>But... I think there's a lot more nuance and design involved in a playset than is shown in the current FiasCON one. Much like IAWA Oracles, there's an art to writing a playset; and so I'd have to say that FiasCON is a decent first draft, not a ready-to-run playset. Keep tweaking!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
