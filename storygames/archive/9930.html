My game The Outpost has reverse flags. And that's awesome.<br/><br/>"What's a 'reverse flag'?" you say. "Well," says I, "A reverse flag is something on your character sheet that gives you an indication of what another player wants to see from your character in the game." In my game, since characters are made communally and then chosen from, it means that the character's Focus was likely set down by another player. And when you're playing that character, the Focus acts as a flag for you to act upon, and others to act upon, too!<br/><br/>I could see this be even more straightforward, though. I make a character and then you get to put something on my character sheet that tells me what excites you about him/her. You go "Your character Zorro is so cool! I wanna see him charming a woman, so I'm gonna put down 'In love with Se\xf1orita Escalante' on your sheet." Then I have that on my sheet and I play on that, because that's what you want to see. I in turn get to put something on your character sheet that's a flag for you to play off of.<br/><br/>Are there any games out there that do this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220644/#Comment_220644" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T14:12:54+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  2:12PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Vincent Baker's <i>Apocalypse World</i>, someone else marks one of your stats according to what they find most interesting.

But by your definition. the confessionals in InSpectres are reverse flags. Other players dish to the camera about your character during play, and if you subsequently play to those characterizations (which are captured on your character sheet just as 'In love with Se\xf1orita Escalante' is in your game) you get bonus dice.

The fact that he is Muslim might be an important detail that I want my fellow players to know about. It's part of the flavor of the character. But I don't want game sessions where at every turn, my character is confronted about his religion. Having a background says that I've dealt with that already and we can move on. Or that if it comes up, we'll assume my character will win that discussion and we'll fast-forward past it.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220799/#Comment_220799" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T12:21:36+00:00" title="July 26, 2009 12:21PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            boulet:<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/><br/>...that's <i>fucking sweet</i>.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220815/#Comment_220815" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T13:51:22+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  1:51PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite>"Reverse flags" should be ways for the GM to indicate to the players what type of contents she would like to have in the game.</blockquote>\nA few GenCons ago, I made this suggestion as "Bounties", the GM offers XP for certain choices, "If you come into the scene right now and mistake them for having a loving embrace, 50 XP."  I'd probably have folks do some more thinking about how it works so it doesn't just become the GM's Carrot Game. <br/><br/>Fate 2.0 has exactly this. Read page 20, <i>Plot, Genre, and Fate Points</i>. Now, they suggest going about it in a particular way, but there's no reason why it can't be done in an off the cuff fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220822/#Comment_220822" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T15:02:43+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  3:02PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Franck, that's totally sweet! <br/>There's a bit in Anima Prime which reminds me of this, there are two different sections for point-form backgrounds:<br/>a) stuff that you don't want the GM to fuck with, and b) stuff you want to come up in play, to be twisted around, etc.<br/><br/>&amp; Simon, that's really great.
