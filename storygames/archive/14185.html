It's there for some time, barely moving. It's watching a poster with a question mark on it".<br/>\nIt then moves forward, through the wall, into a room with a few dentist-beds, surrounded by strange apparature; a room with a tied man in the courner, a man bleeding from his mouth(...).a chinese man."<br/>\n<br/>\nit all started with Agent Shreiber and his need to vent out.<br/>\nwe were given a mission - a girl was kidnapped, and the men responsible is sleeping here next to us. we were told a biker-gang kidnapped a girl, for ransom, and we were to find the men responsible and bring them to the control-approved places in blue city, for futher interrogation. as there exist places which are less static-prone; places where more time could be spent.<br/>\nWe were to be dropped next to bike-gangers' den. primary objective included learning the place where the girl is held up.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe drop<br/>\nagent sasha suddenly realized he was walking in a skirt, holding a child's hand and a shopping bag in his different hand. The husband was shocked.<br/>\nHis requested Katana was in the guy's car. his silenced pistol - inside the bag, in the chocolate box.<br/>\n<br/>\nagent Shreiber, requested his collection of baseball bats he dreamed of. he was given only a few.<br/>\nhe couldn't stand breaking anyone's nearby feet with that and pulling an informant's body behind his motorcycle. achilles-style.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe battered body was then tossed through the window of the gangers' den, where epic fight happened.<br/>\nagent sasha proved to be fast with his katana, and to think tactically, he even build himself a shield from the scraps of cut bodies.<br/>\nwhen the big-ganger emerged to cover the suspects' retreat, a big ganger who wasn't that easy to kill, agent shreiber threw agent sasha out the window (more or less) so that agent sasha could stop a fleeing suspect.<br/>\n<br/>\nwhen the situation was taken control of - that included tossing tables out the wall and breaking people's legs with an ash tray (again, agent shreiber),<br/>\nthe sun light got blue and,<br/>\nthere seem to be a lot of people appearing in the windows of the building. all the people that ever tried to convince the gangers to quit their trade. all the grandmas, parents, friends. watching the corspes.<br/>\nagent sasha was given orders to stay, to extract orders from a living gangers, while agent shreiber was given the order to drive the suspect to the control-approved basement, where there suspect will be interrogated for other possible kindappings.<br/>\n<br/>\nSasha's subject (the man to be interrogated) appeared to have an agent tie under his shirt. and it appeared, all the people surrounding the building/ windows did too. <br/>\nagent shreiber left, laughing. sasha's subject turned out to be an agent in disguise (spy?), agent Carver, explaining<br/>\nshreib was told agent sasha will be destroyed, for being "too much of a wimp". to the bully this reason spoke volumes. agent shreiber left with the suspect with his ferrarri.<br/>\nagent sasha on the contrary was told that agent shreiber was being too aggresive and stupid for certain missions, so that now he was being served as a decoy. and that they weren't after the girl.<br/>\n<br/>\nagent carver explained how agent shreiber was given directions to the "control-approved basement" which was actually an area where the real target was located - mister Takato.<br/>\nagent sasha was to follow agent shreiber. agent carver gave agent sasha a wet, stinking parcel, and told him to use it "only in grave danger". agent sasha was also given a backpack and c4.<br/>\nagent shreiber, thinking its the end of the mission, has used a lot of his force on impressive feats, such as car stunts, driving on the walls to scare the suspect, and playing out a game of Carmageddon.<br/>\n<br/>\nthey started hearing police sirens getting close.<br/>\nwhile Sasha was pursuing agent shreiber, he quickly realized he cant keep up. so he decided he'll speed so much he almost changed to a lightning bolt.<br/>\nunfortunately for him, he didn't roll under 11. the lightning bolt catched all the static in the surrounding metal parts, jumping from objects on the street more or less  randomly.<br/>\nhe landed in a nearby pool. expanding all over the whole water in it. and as the agent stood up, he found himself to be over 5 meters tall and in the shape of the pool.<br/>\nhe continued to pursue the red ferrarri though (which he could see, being higher than surrounding roofs at that point). he kept pursuing the car as a lightning bolt.<br/>\nwhen while flying, mid air, he noticed 3-4 figures on the roof of the skyscraper.<br/>\n<br/>\nthe package kept decaying and starting to smell unbearable but as shreiber neared the block, and so did sasha - pursuing shreiber, following Control's directions at that point. Shreiber overheard Control giving orders to Sasha and got aware of his presence and that he indeed was not killed.<br/>\n they both got close to the skyscraper with the figures on it, and noticed one man being thrown off it unpon their arrival.<br/>\nthe man turned out to be mr Takato. mr takato met the ground, and spattered all the nearby parking lot and the cars in his blood. insane amounts of blood.<br/>\nControl instructed agent sasha to stay out of Mr takato's way. and go to the roof immediately.<br/>\nin a moment mr takato stood up next to dazzled agent shreider, who from that point on didn't react to any orders. mr takato stood up, regained balance. and sniffed the air then followed agent sasha - angrilly,  agent sasha disobeyed direct orders to avoid mr takato and engaged mr takato in a quick katana fight then burned him with the electricity extracted from all the neighbourhood's electric installations, mr takato's katana fell down.<br/>\nthe police cars got closer, mr takato's body fell down on the parking lot, again, in what felt like a glitch. deja vu. agents who got out of the police cars, collected the body. <br/>\ncontrol operator insisted agent sasha  deliver the package to the men waiting on the roof.<br/>\nthe men turned out to be the spidermen.<br/>\nthe package kept decaying as the static grew. now the package fell apart exposing it's contents- an aborted fetus, which in sudden realization agent sasha realized is the girl they were sent to rescue, that never grew up.<br/>\nand she was to be the daughter of mr takato.<br/>\n<br/>\nthey both extracted,<br/>\nelectricity in the whole city was missing<br/>\nand the tied body in the courner appeared dead.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321874/#Comment_321874" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-26T18:52:41+00:00" title="April 26, 2011  6:52PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow... that goes to show one of the many faces of gaming with Lacuna.

I kind of throw an extra information here and there till I figure out what it all means and how it is connected.<br/>\nThen, we also narrated camera tricks and movements, generally tried to make it look like a script for a movie, which, I feel, reinforced the "mood" and effected in pretty nice scenes descriptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
