That the show started out a Westworld-meets-Stepford thing and then ended up about a psychological zombie-ish apocalypse is just so, so cool. Anyway, I naturally am now jonesing to figure some sort of RPG take on this that I can run for an upcoming Gameday.<br/><br/>Any ideas? I have no clue what system I would use or how I would scale down the premise so that something meaningful could be accomplished in 4-5 hours.<br/><br/>The one gimmick I thought up would be to give the pregen characters either no names or just code-names (alpha, whiskey, echo, etc.). Then, I could have an equal number of cards that have the PCs identification tattoos (e.g., "I am Sophie Miller"). As the players discover the tattoos on each other, the cars get dealt to them randomly, so you end up with female personalities in male bodies, and so on.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I dunno. I figure they PCs will be dolls that have been imprinted randomly as part of some post-apocalyptic failsafe (or eve error), all awaking in some tech-filled bunker.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254132/#Comment_254132" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T17:31:53+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  5:31PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One title comes to mind.<br/><br/>"A Penny for my Thoughts..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254134/#Comment_254134" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T17:39:10+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  5:39PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2010 5:41PM by buzz.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vulpinoid</cite>One title comes to mind.<br/><br/>"A Penny for my Thoughts..."</blockquote>\nThat did occur to me, though I do not own the game.<br/><br/>EDIT: I keep feeling like this is the time for me to finally use Solar System.

Did they put themselves in the body, or were they put there?<br/><br/>Maybe one does or has worked at a dollhouse, so he knows just enough (more?) to kind of explain what has happened.
