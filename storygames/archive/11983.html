And as such, I really should post about all the TVI stuff in the FAQ. You start from the bottom. Specifically, the leftmost circle for 19-20. Here's a handy illustration I just made that should hopefully clear it up.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://dig1000holes.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/tvi-explained.jpg?w=479&amp;h=405"/><br/><br/>If you have any more questions about that section, please ask.

I'd expound further on that subject, and others, on the site, but every time I save an edit, WordPress erases all my line breaks. Which is awesome.<br/><br/>I was actually playing in a Time &amp; Temp game last night where the menace got those first three circles filled in, and one Paradox Die locked on 20, which is pretty scary stuff, especially since our end of the Anachronometer was choked with numbers. We were only threatening paradox on a 3, but everything else already had two occurrences in the Matrix. Our opponent had a TVI Rating of 3, so another 40 minutes of game time and I think we would have been screwed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268206/#Comment_268206" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-21T18:29:27+00:00" title="April 21, 2010  6:29PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!!

I do have a follow-up, though:<br/><br/>Is there any negative aspect (other than having to roll paradox dice) to checking all circles for a number?</blockquote>\nThere are only two effects of having three or more circles checked off for a number:<br/><br/>- Every time you check off a circle beyond that line, you roll the the Paradox Dice.<br/><br/>- Every number that has been checked off three or more times threatens paradox, which means the Paradox Dice lock in when they roll one of these numbers.<br/><br/><i>Example: You have three circles checked off for 1, 2, 3 and 5. Everything else has two or less circles checked off. The temps are meddling with things and end up checking off a fourth number for 5. You now roll your Paradox Dice and get a 17, 12, and 3. Since 3 has three or more circles checked off, that Paradox Die gets locked in and things start to get really hairy. If this is the first Paradox Die to get locked in, then from here on out every time the temps roll to accomplish something, they have to roll an addition die of the appropriate size and they have to ignore the highest die they roll. This is going to make it harder and harder for them to get high numbers.</i><br/><br/>I should point out, as is evident on the Anachronometer, for 13 through 20 you only need two circles checked off to threaten paradox and cause the Paradox Dice to be rolled. These numbers can only be filled in if you've got a villain with a TVI rating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268677/#Comment_268677" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T13:28:05+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  1:28PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That males perfect sense.
