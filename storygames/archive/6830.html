I was quite surprised how good it was.<br/><br/>See, I bought IAWA at the same time as Poison'd, and read them both on the train back from Edinburgh. Poison'd looked superb: I wanted to play it straight away. IAWA looked less inviting.<br/><br/>Then I read all the Actual Play reports. It's interesting that, although IAWA is fun to play, the Actual Play always seems so dull. Like this.\n<blockquote>And then my explorer expelled the nature god from the Kingdom and built an empire of golden spires over the forest. The nature god was angry and, on the eve of the wedding, the townspeople...</blockquote>\nAnd you just think: whoah. This sounds completely wanky. Kill an orc already. <br/><br/>Anyway, but we played it in the garden last weekend and it was great. We'd intended to play one chapter and we got through three, staying much later than we intended. Adam GMd the first two chapters, then I took over.<br/><br/>It was interesting to note that, if I described our Actual Play to you, it would seem wanky and dull ((the example above is taken from our game). But, in play, it was bloody good.<br/><br/>So, yes, it's not a bad game and I might well play it again.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152068/#Comment_152068" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T03:27:00+00:00" title="June 21, 2008  3:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say that most actual play, not only IAWA, is excruciatingly dull, especially if it's only describing what's going on in the game's fiction. So I don't think you can conclude anything about a game from the dullness of an AP report.<br/><br/>That being said, I still think APs are important, perhaps THE most important communication tool about a game. We are just really bad at APs, I am bad at APs, but we/I can get better. I still think the APs on The Forge, or some of them at least, set the standards. Because we want to know who the people where playing the game as well, what happened to them, how the game's procedures interacted with them, etc. etc.<br/><br/>But...wanky? I don't think I get why your play example is particularly wanky, or why you'd have a general idea of IAWA being wanky? Or do you simply think that players describing what goes on in the shared imagined space is wanky? Is it wanky when the GM is descibing as well, fx?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152074/#Comment_152074" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T06:05:43+00:00" title="June 21, 2008  6:05AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Graham finds wanky is probably an interesting topic, but likely more of a Knife Fight sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152092/#Comment_152092" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T11:14:05+00:00" title="June 21, 2008 11:14AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham:<br/><br/>Just for your interest, I totally get what you're talking about.

It's all ghosts and princesses and empires and I find it hard to imagine how I'd get a handle on it in play. <br/><br/>However, when I play it, it's a lot of fun, and the stories feel much more involving and personal than when they're told in the abstract.<br/><br/>(Per, does that help explain?)<br/><br/>As Steve mentions, we played again today. It wasn't the runaway success it was last week, but it was another solidly fun game. I'm liking IAWA a lot.<br/><br/>Of the two games, I still prefer Poison'd, but IAWA is a great game, and I'd certainly play again.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152148/#Comment_152148" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T18:49:21+00:00" title="June 21, 2008  6:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the emphasis on empires and dynasties and the dead in actual play is an upshot of the disconnected stories; why are we burying an aged king now when we were saving the boy king last week?  Well... because he grew old and died... and now we're playing that out.  <br/><br/>The cool thing is when events that are played later but which come before lead us to explain everything.  When that happens it makes me feel like I'm watching a very clever TV series and I jump all over it.  It's easy to emphasize that stuff in the actual play because it's such a cool moment when one guy goes "Oh! Oh!  THIS is the guy who killed THAT guy.
