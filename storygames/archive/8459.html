A character starts with a Drive, defined by the player and vetted by the gm, that rewards 1xp for making it important to the scene or 3xp for risk, danger, or sacrifice because of the Drive in the scene; the character can get 5xp by acting in a way that contradicts, foregos, or eliminates the Drive, but then the Drive is gone and a new one must take its place. As with the career xp, only the highest-value one scores per scene.  A character may spend XP to have more than one Drive at a time, at a cost of 5xp for the second, 10xp for the third, 15xp for the fourth, and 20xp for the fifth; multiple Drives may score, as appropriate, in the same scene.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeveral example Drives: Greedy (1xp: make some money, fantasize about how you're going to be rich, admonish someone for their impracticality when they choose something over money; 3xp: screw over someone dangerous for cash, ignore common sense and any morality for profit or a big payoff, sell out someone that matters to you for quick money; 5xp: ignore a reward of wealth for something more ephemeral, swear (and actually live in) poverty, gain so much treasure you don't care anymore); Hook-handed (1xp: drop your mug 'cause you've got a hook for a hand, accidentally get your hook caught in someone's wig or bustle, hang off an otherwise un-holdable surface with good old hook-hand; 3xp: subject your hook to potentially dangerous enchantments, leave your hook behind at the scene of the crime, fumble a catch of a bag full of rubies since your damned hook isn't nimble and then it falls into Davy Jone's Locker; 5xp: prove that the handicapped are just as capable as the un-maimed, accept and otherwise ignore the handicap, get the hand grown back by some holy hermit or maybe a claw grows there you sick Chaos worshiping mutant you); Family (1xp: you are doing it for the kids/wife/mom/dear old aunt Matilde who taught you how to grave-rob, spend time attending to family matters, get in an argument with family over what you're doing; 3xp: avenge your parents (whoever) by hunting criminals in your big "bat-dude" outfit, give up all your dreams and valuable treasure to keep the family farm, do something stupid and dangerous to win your grandfather's approval and prove you're not a coward; 5xp: kill your family, leave for another part of the world and never mention it again, take what you want though the cost will fall to your family)<br/>\n<br/>\nFate points!  The character's FP score determines two things: how many fortune points are put into a common pool in the center of the table (total of all character FP plus one per player), and how many a character can benefit from in a given scene (other players may expend fortune on a gm action or character without limit).  Any player (including the gm) can take a fortune point from the pool and use it for another player's character or action (not their own).  The pool refreshes at the beginning of a session.  FP can be permanently expended as usual, but also require that the character change at least one of their Drives without gaining XP (and may change more, if desired).  FP are gained for completing quests, explained by the gm at the beginning of the session (or as new quests become available).<br/>\n<br/>\nSupport rolls:  A skill or characteristic (or WS/BS) test can get help from other skills or another character.  A given roll can only benefit from one other roll, but rolls could be chained.  A successful support roll gives +5% (+5% per degree of success) to the supported roll; the action of the support roll must make sense to the gm, and if failure in the support roll would affect the main roll, then it either causes a penalty or simply prevents the main roll from succeeding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187387/#Comment_187387" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T12:22:02+00:00" title="January 10, 2009 12:22PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's keeping you from getting some story gaming done with Warhammer?

This has a lot to do with all of these hobbies running on imagination and/or gamery of different sorts. At least to me it seems that I couldn't walk into a single high school class here in Finland without finding enough people for a game. Heck, that's, like, near the top of my big list of obviousl plans for when I run out of people to play with - go to the closest school, talk about this culture with some teachers, give a couple of lectures about independent art, IP industries and stuff, play a few games, get to know the high schoolers and start a roleplaying club. Worked like charm the last time I tried it.<br/><br/>That said, another angle of attack would be to stealth-storify Warhammer, if only for the lulz. I especially like the idea of keeping the character sheet from the game unchanged so as to reassure the players while simultaneously redoing the actual system. The beauty of this is that in an environment predicated on GM authority the players won't even realize that your game is houseruled up the wazoo, as they all expect every GM to play the game differently anyway. No problem here that I can see.<br/><br/>Also, Solar System works quite nicely for Warhammer. As a totally lateral approach, we played a successful Warhammer Solar System campaign a couple of years ago with the local teenagers without the Warhammer rpg materials; instead, what we did was that we based the whole game around the army books for the miniature game. Took maps, backstory, character concepts and stuff out of the Breton, Empire and Orc army books and set our game in the Africa-equivalent of the setting, as the big map of the place in the Orcs book looked interesting. It's pretty funny how different the game was from the actual Warhammer rpg - ours matched with the tone and focus of the miniatures game (in which THERE IS ONLY WAR) to the tee, with plenty of skirmish action, army logistics, lethal battles and such. No adventuring paradigm at all to it, the characters were squarely in the middle of the military machine(s) they were supposed to be running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187597/#Comment_187597" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T12:47:42+00:00" title="January 11, 2009 12:47PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Books Burner</cite>I noticed that in my country if I want to attract more people to gaming tabel, I must use a well-known system, which is Warhammer.

You can probably hack together a playable set of rules from there.  I altered the sheet a bit after play, to make all three of the "damage" tracks bad (you go insane, die, or your heresy is revealed; after all, it's 40K).  The "I Secretly Believe" box is where you write down your heresy.  The "Office, Retinue, etc." replace the five senses breakdown of traits.  You basically continue playing until only one character (or no characters) is left.  Then you narrate their various demises. I still have half of a PDF document somewhere, where I was writing up some rules for it, but I don't think I got very far.<br/><br/>P.S. As I remember from the playtest, you got added dice to your victory pool when a character that you controlled died (not when you killed other characters), but I could see trying that a number of ways or even having less of a combat focus and being more like traditional 1001 Nights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deckard" title="Deckard"><img alt="Deckard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deckard">Deckard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189385/#Comment_189385" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-21T11:21:08+00:00" title="January 21, 2009 11:21AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jacek, maybe you should try with TSoY?
