This is your guidebook. Imagine you could get into a time machine and travel back to the fourteenth century. What would you see? What would you smell? More to the point, where are you going to stay? Should you go to a castle or a monastic guest house? And what are you going to eat? What sort of food are you going to be offered by a peasant or a monk or a lord?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis radical new approach turns our entire understanding of history upside down. It shows us that the past is not just something to be studied; it is also something to be lived. It sets out to explain what life was like in the most immediate way, through taking you, the reader, to the middle ages, and showing you everything from the horrors of leprosy and war to the ridiculous excesses of roasted larks and haute couture.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a guidebook, many questions are answered which do not normally occur in traditional history books. How do you greet people in the street? What should you use for toilet paper? How fast--and how safely--can you travel? Why might a physician want to taste your blood? And how do you test to see if you are going down with the plague?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result is the most astonishing social history book you are ever likely to read: revolutionary in its concept, informative and entertaining in its detail, and startling for its portrayal of humanity in an age of violence, exuberance and fear."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244682/#Comment_244682" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T14:28:14+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  2:28PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At some point I wanted to write a book just like this to justify traveling around the UK.

Everyone needs to own it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd by "everyone" I mean everyone who roleplays in a faux medieval fantasy world that loosly fits in the 13th-15th century.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book focuses on England, but...so does most fantasy roleplay games even if some like to give faux germanic or french names to things.  The opening chapter lays out a typical small city from the perspective of a visiting traveler starting with what you'd see...and smell as you approached.  The paragraphs on the various efforts officials made to bring some sense of sanitation to their cities (like ordinances against flaying dead horses within the city walls or dumping your excrement in the city fire fighting water cisterns, really gives a feel for how nasty a place a period city was.  It goes on to give insight into the layout of the city,  How typically half or more was walled off for various church and monastic compounds, how the market evolved, and why buildings were built the way they were off on to a description of what the city looks like off the main roads into the warren of 3 foot wide alleys that snaked around like a maze where most of the population lived.  It brings up lifestyle notes like how (unlike today) most common people spent very little time at or in their homes, which is why most homes were 1-2 rooms with a hearth and a mattress and little else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe chapter goes on to discuss the network of towns and villages throughout the country side and how the distinguishing feature of a town was not its population but the presence of a market.  If you left your cluster of buildings to travel to another cluster of buildings to sell the fruits of your labor and buy the finished goods you needed...then you lived in a village and the place you traveled to to do that was a town.  Much like Manhattan today the number of people in a medieval town during the day was often 2-3 times higher than its permanent population due to all the transient people coming to and fro to the market.  The smaller town markets were mostly day trips for the nearby villagers, the larger markets would have inns and hostels and people accepting borders into their homes for longer trips.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty good stuff and immediately useable as descriptive flavor.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext chapter is titled "People".  Should be good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260816/#Comment_260816" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T21:10:13+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  9:10PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I totally own this book now.

Most of these appear to be secondary sources. On average I'd say there's a reference note every seven paragraphs or so, so it's not like he's backing up every point he makes. It makes great RPG fodder and entertainment.

The indications for travel times, for instance are based on actual records of "so and so was in this city on this day and arrived at that city on that day".  The descriptions of what you're likely to find inside a persons home are based on inheritance inventories of the contents of the deceased's homes.  Price estimates for items are based on many of the same records where (much like today) an appraisal of the contents of the home was taken and filed so the government could get their cut.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261967/#Comment_261967" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-14T21:14:42+00:00" title="March 14, 2010  9:14PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, guys.<br><br>Anything in the works cited that jumps out at you?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
