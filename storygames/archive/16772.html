When you know that you're holding the card your opponent is trying to hook on the draw, that's ironic. Because asymmetric viewpoints are still present even when information is technically equal, it's more difficult to name a game that doesn't involve irony than one that does. Chess definitely is ironic when you've outcalculated your opponent, for example.<br/><br/>For an example of a game that is barely ironic at all I'll point to single player abstract games like <i>Tetris</i>. For Tetris I think you'll need an outside observer and a game-external narrative to get more than incidental irony going, and then you might as well be evaluating theater. Of course, irony being inherent to us as humans, even here we're perfectly capable of developing an ironic narrative: isn't it ironic how I waited for ages to get that straight piece, and now it dropped just after I gave up on it?<br/><br/>I guess I'm going to have to side with the viewpoint that everything's ironic in some context, so the question becomes pretty trivial. Or rather, it becomes a question of what irony is and how much and what sort you're going to need, and so on. And that's just another angle on the structure of narrative and audience viewpoint analysis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383151/#Comment_383151" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T01:02:04+00:00" title="June 23, 2012  1:02AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paranoia charges into mind, on horseback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383164/#Comment_383164" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-23T07:26:28+00:00" title="June 23, 2012  7:26AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the game I'm working on, two players control a single PC.

I don't like to get all "English teacher" and correct people on grammar and literary terms and stuff.<br/><br/>However, irony is a term that is used incorrectly a lot. And years ago, when I was working in education, Alanis Morissette's "Isn't It Ironic" song came out and English teachers threw a fit, because most of her examples in the song do not conform to the definition of irony. So I took the time to make sure I learned it so I could speak to it when it came up.<br/><br/>Your example, along with most of Alanis' examples, are examples of tragedy, rather than irony.<br/><br/>The easiest way to remember the difference is this:<br/><br/>Irony represents a challenge to reasonable expectation. Tragedy represents a failure of hope.<br/><br/>Playing Tetris, you are free to hope that you'll get the piece you want when you need it. But there's no reasonable expectation that you will. Each piece is independantly randomly determined - the game doesn't cycle through the 7 pieces completely before repeating, for example, so you really have no idea how long it'll take until you get that straight piece. (And when you finally do, you may see 3 of them right away.)<br/><br/>Alanis' most clear example - when it rains on your wedding day. You can hope it won't happen. But when you're planning an event out about 12 months in advance and weather prediction usually only forecasts about 10 days or so in advance, you have no reasonable expectation of avoiding rain unless you add a heck of a lot more details to the scenario. If you're holding the wedding in a desert that has had 60 years of only having a few brief showers each year in March and your wedding is in October, then yeah, you can have a reasonable expectation of avoiding rain. But if you're having a spring wedding in Baltimore, you're just tempting fate if you don't provide tents for your garden party wedding. You're relying on hope, not reasonable expectation.<br/><br/>Sorry for the long rant-like post. But just as we encourage each other to use gaming terminology clearly and accurately, when we're going to use literary terms, we should use them correctly as well.<br/><br/>Hope vs reasonable expectation is not a standard differentiator that I've seen a ton of places, but I think it helps as an easy test for when you aren't sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383473/#Comment_383473" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-26T16:07:01+00:00" title="June 26, 2012  4:07PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2012 4:33PM by Graham.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Irony can be defined in different ways, like most terms.

There's some dungeon game that Brandon brought over once where you're all trying to defeat the big bad, but what youre REALLY doing is trying to get the best loot for yourself. That's kind of the same thing, right?<br/><br/>In the Dune board game where the Bene Gesserit makes a guess as to who will win and when, then if that happens they win instead. Best Bene Gesserit move ever: I predict Brandon will win on turn one.<br/><br/>You Have to Burn the Rope<br/><br/>In 7 Wonders, trying to gain points through military, if someone else is doing the same, is the best way to sink a lot of resources into getting not very many points. I don't think the irony is intended, however.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle, a game in which you cynically initiate coups in foreign nations in order to prove that your way of life is better for the world than your opponent's. Same game, where you start wars in order to bring the world closer to nuclear war, because an unstable world situation reduces your opponent's options. Here the irony is external, and the game effects just underline it.<br/><br/>A friend of mine, raised with left-wing leanings, who said he finally understand how capitalism works after playing the old computer version of Railway Tycoon.<br/><br/>Attempting to play Twilight Imperium in hopes of extracting the promise on the box.<br/><br/>That cow button pushing game. Any Facebook game. It's ironic in so far as you play it as though you were making progress.<br/><br/>Speaking of which... Progress Quest!

The classic examples of dramatic irony are that the audience knows things that the characters do not - such as knowing that Oedipus is his father's killer.  It constantly happens in games that I am seeing things differently than my opponent does.  For example, bluffing is stating or implying the opposite of what is true about my cards - which is one definition of verbal irony.  <br/><br/>Also, many games are intended to mix-and-match elements in various ways that lead to irony.  For example, in Magic: The Gathering, I would suggest that casting "Flying" on your "Wall of Ice" is ironic - because the expectation of a wall is that it is stationary.  The game is deliberately arranged to throw together elements that weren't designed for each other.  Similarly, I was playing a game of Talisman with my son last night where for a time, my Leprechaun was stronger than his Gladiator.
