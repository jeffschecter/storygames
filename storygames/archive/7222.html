I like HWCTLH a lot, and I like L5R a little, and I think HWCTLH is a better system for it, but I have to figure out how to get fantasy Japan to fit into HW...'s rules. Thoughts?\n<blockquote>At the end of the last world, Cloud Lady and Ocean Lord raised their jewel-bound spear and, together, swept the water over the mountains of Wa; they sank the eight islands into the sea.<br/><br/>They took one another in hand, and went to walk away from the world, but not before giving the spear to their children Radiant Daughter and Iron Prince, who said, "We will not stir the ocean to upraise the second Wa, for it is full of salt and we do not wish to build a kingdom on a foundation of tears."<br/><br/>Radiant Daughter replied, "Then let us take mountains from vast Shinshuu-which-lies-to-the-west. We will plant them in the water to grow our new lands."<br/><br/>So they raised up the jewel-bound spear and cut nine mountains from the yellow earth of Shinshuu, saying, "Shinshuu is a land of many mountains. They will not miss just nine." They sank them into the water and made a new land in the shape of a phoenix, and in its eye they built a palace of black metal and white paper, and named it Izumo after Izumo-that-came-before.<br/><br/>In the palace they built jewel-bound thrones, twelve in number, and exalted twelve sacred beasts to the throne. In the west they seated the creatures of evening, the cat, snake, and wolf. In the north they seated the denizens of the air, the butterfly, crane, and swallow. In the south they seated the forest animals, the deer, rabbit, and tiger. And in the east, where the sun would touch them first, they placed the immortals, the dragon, kirin, and phoenix.<br/><br/>They said to them, "Man is not fit to be the ruler of men, so beasts and gods will sit on the thrones of Izumo until Wa once again sinks beneath the waters." The new kings and queens variously bowed and nodded their heads, and went out among the cities and temples to seek out the daimyos and courtiers that would serve beneath them, each to his liking. Radiant Daughter and Iron Prince were their Emperor and Empress, and they walked among their kings, throneless, for they said that the greatest ruler is humble and stands no higher than his people.<br/><br/>That was a thousand years ago.<br/><br/>What Radiant Daughter and Iron Prince did not notice was that Shinshuu did notice its missing mountains, and demons had begun to ooze out of their empty sockets like blood from a wound.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160701/#Comment_160701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T18:32:17+00:00" title="August  4, 2008  6:32PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's HWCTLH?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160702/#Comment_160702" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-04T18:34:14+00:00" title="August  4, 2008  6:34PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.galileogames.com/hwctlh/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.galileogames.com/hwctlh/index.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
