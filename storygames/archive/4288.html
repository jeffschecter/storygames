Real character development and change (such as seen in stories) should be encouraged and even integrated with/made to precede or follow from mechanical character improvement.<br/><br/>I like Burning Wheel's beliefs for this reason, they are not locked and can change, some cry out to be challenged and to change.  It's made clear up front this is expected.<br/><br/>I speak as a GM of a long running campaign unable to get players into more narrativist gameplay and bored to tears (well not literally) with seeing some characters who however wonderfully imagined and backstoryed when created are always "the same person" even after over a decade of real time and game time passage who have never showed change or growth as a "person" even though they have travelled to different lands, encountered peoples of very different faiths, learned truths about the world not generally known etc. etc.<br/><br/>That said, yes some "flags" if they are "what makes this character someone I want to play" beliefs need to be capable of staying true and if you don't know "which might be that one" allowing any external to player dictation of them is dangerous.  I prefer systems that may say, "time of a change" but leave the player to define what the change is.  Using Dogs in Vineyard as an example, after calling on your relationship with Dad in a fight and losing is a great time to find story explanation to either strengthen or decrease it.<br/><br/>In terms of one technique/process, isn't the essence of a hard-core Bang the equivalent of seeing flags redefined, re-ordered in priority, found or discarded.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96684/#Comment_96684" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T19:20:24+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  7:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite>I agree that a system for "flagging" should include a system for changing flags.</blockquote>Well, I disagree.<br/><br/>Static flags and changeable flags are different techniques.

Because of how they get handed on to other writers, superheroes are a great example here. Superman is always the big blue Boy Scout, Spider-Man is always covering his personal pain with bad jokes, Reid Richards is always smarter than anyone around him. It's to the point where playing a character with that name is practically a flag in itself. These are characters with a strong sense of identity. You know where you are with these characters.<br/><br/>Inasmuch as D&amp;D classes are flags, this is the kind of flag they are.<br/><br/>What changeable flags do well is show the development of characters over time. Peter Parker gains confidence, wins Mary-Jane, marries her, eventually (in one continuity) divorces her.<br/><br/>TSOY Keys are classic examples of this kind of flag.<br/><br/>And both of them are realistic in terms of how we experience ourselves and people around us. There are things that change, and things that don't change. <br/><br/>And then there are things that look like they won't ever change and one day they do.<br/><br/>Maybe we need another distinction: flags that change gradually and flags that change suddenly and catastrophically. I tried for this in City of Masks, where relationships with other characters can be either positive or negative and either "fickle" or "enduring". A fickle relationship changes constantly under the influence of the other character's actions, but an enduring relationship doesn't change until the other character has repeatedly and over a long period done things that would change it, until eventually it changes "all at once".<br/><br/>So, let's say character A hates character B (8 points). If that's fickle, every time character B does something that would make the relationship 1 point more positive, it gets more positive by 1 point, then and there. But if it's enduring, character B has to do 8 points of positive stuff before it suddenly becomes neutral.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96706/#Comment_96706" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T20:13:07+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  8:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, just thought of another example that's at least tangentially relevant.

As is this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>And then there are things that look like they won't ever change and one day they do.</blockquote>\nThis all relates to story pacing, I think: you want change to feel "right" for the character and the narrative, and that can often mean drawing it out, not changing too abruptly. It also makes a difference what timeframe you have for play--you want to change far quicker for a one-shot or short (say, 3 session) game than for a long-term campaign. Kind of like a movie vs. a TV series.<br/><br/>It'd be very useful, methinks, to have a means of flagging "growth speed" for characters, like your "enduring" and "ficle," Mike.<br/><br/>As a point of data, you do in fact resolve Kickers in Sorceror: you play until the Vengeance-thing is played out, then you write a new kicker. You do so until the character seems "done." Depending on how the Kicker pans out, your new one might still be Vengeance, against the same or a different target, or you may renounce vengeance, or you may have extracted vengeance and be satisfied. Or whatever. Point being, you do change your Flags.<br/><br/><i>But</i>, you don't just change 'em whenever. You change 'en at a specific (though not precicely predictable) story point. Like changing Issues on your Spotlight Episode in PTA (which <i>is</i> a predictable point). It's kind of like a Flag Evaluation, especially in PTA, where you decide if you wanna keep going in the same direction, or strike out on a new path. All this in contrast to Keys, which are all, Bam! Renounce Beliefs! any ol' time, out of the blue.<br/><br/>All of which I was keen to point out and be brilliant, but Mike beat me to it. Dammit.<br/><br/>A question emerges from all this: what games actually have unchangeable Flags (as opposed to gradually changing)? Alls I can think of is Mike's D&amp;D example, mostly because it's a pain in the freakin' ass to change Badassery Specialies (i.e. Classes) midstream. Alignment would seem, if anything, to be D&amp;D's changeable Flag, though in practice I've seen that treated overwhelmingly like a Fixed Flag; that is, characters are always LG or CN or whatever forever and ever Amen. Are there any games out there that explicitly set up Fixed Flags as such? Maybe Capes with the Comics Code, though even that is subject to review, like "OK, noww the kid gloves are off, man.

One day, a couple seasons in, she finds the "perfect" man, rich and handsome. She gets married! Yay, issue solved, right? Not quite, once married, things start falling apart. Hubby's family is rude, and hubby has some sexual problems (if I'm remembering right).<br><br>The point here is that the situation is re-imagined around a common theme. In a game, both situations could be covered by a broad flag, like PTA's Issues ("looking for the perfect marriage" or something). But in most games I can think of, flags tend to be a bit more specific, such that the above would require a change from "looking for a husband" to "problematic relationship".<br><br>What do you think about that?

"Single girl on the prowl" gets used for a while, then tossed in favor of "Stuck in a no-win situation."  Because "Wants to be a wife" is still there, we've got a pretty good clue about the <i>context</i> of the no-win situation ... each key specifies the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nSide-note:  I actually like the effect of that <i>a lot</i>, because of the way it lets you change a character gradually, while still keeping a recognizable thread of who they are.  In the instance above, if the wife decides she'd rather be single again then she can toss "Wants to be a wife" while keeping "No-win situation" ... so now she's in a messy divorce, and can't seem to get her life in any kind of recognizable order.  It's a natural transition from her previous situation, because you're keeping an element constant while changing other things.  Sort of like how you need to keep a hand and foot steady while rock-climbing, in order to reach with the other limbs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97118/#Comment_97118" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T07:41:14+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  7:41AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't the difference between a fixed aspect of the character and a changing aspect of the character basically what a player chooses to do in a specific situation?<br><br>Isn't it then counter-productive to distinguish between fixed and changeable flags, thus forcing a decision about them before the situation actually gets played out?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97150/#Comment_97150" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T09:40:27+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  9:40AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Georgios</cite>Isn't it then counter-productive to distinguish between fixed and changeable flags, thus forcing a decision about them before the situation actually gets played out?</blockquote>Only if you assume that unconstrained total freedom is always "productive."

I mean, I agree with what you just wrote, but I don't see how this ties into your original post. I'll try to explain how I understood your original post and maybe you can help me out then. <br><br>Flags are about labelling certain aspects of your character in a way that lets the other people at the table (especially the GM) know that those are important to you. That you want to see them featured in the game somehow (usually via relevant narration). <br/><br/>Those flagged aspects can be dealt with in different ways during the game. You've mentionend two: 'static' and 'flexible'. The former would be a kind of fixture in the game ('Jack always looses his cool quickly'). The latter would be more of a struggle or part of the character's development ('Jack is learning to keep his temper in check'). Since both are closely tied to the character and the decisions he makes, they are also closely tied to what the player chooses to let 'Jack' do at any given moment. Thus, the choice between static aspect (continuing to play the character in certain way) and a flexible aspect (breaking with the character's tradition) lies with the player at any moment during the game. <br/><br/>I think this is true for both TSoY and Sorcerer. Up until the point where the player chooses to change the aspect, flagged aspects are indistinguishable from one another. Differentiating between the two before the game, only seems to take away the unpredictability of player choice during the game. Everybody is just waiting for the other shoe to drop. <br/><br/>What am I missing?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97193/#Comment_97193" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T11:19:16+00:00" title="September 18, 2007 11:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My sense is that a static flag is <i>entirely different</i> from a flexible flag that nobody's bothered to "flex" yet.

Nationality would be a good one. You were born in a certain country, you grew up there. Regardless of if you later renounce your citizenship, fight against that country, rail against it, whatever, that's still your origin. Your relationship to the flag has changed, but "the flag is still there" (to slightly paraphrase a certain relevant song).<br><br>In a game set in Britain before about 1950, social class would be another fixed flag. Again, you could try to conceal your class origins, you could do the whole Eliza Doolittle, but deep down you're always a Cockney.<br><br>So what that does is it sets up a category of facts about identity that remain true whether you like or accept them or not. You can rebel, you can kick against the pricks, but you just can't change that about yourself - you can only change your relationship with the flag, not the flag itself.<br><br>There are also internal things about yourself that you can't change. You'll always be an introvert, however hard you pretend. You'll always be drawn to certain things, repelled from some other things. <br/><br/>There are other things you can change - your occupation, say. Your marital status, in the example above. But changing those is only ever a cover over the fact that you can't change your essential nature; you're changing the situation but you can't affect the setting.<br/><br/>Yes?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97274/#Comment_97274" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T14:20:07+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  2:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2007 2:20PM by Max Higley.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike has a good point that are certain classes of things that are reasonable as completely fixed flags and others that aren't.

And interesting results are often fun.  But suppose a player fixes a flag, arrives at a point where they're witnessing the interesting results, and decides it isn't as fun as they thought it would be?  That they would find it more fun to address something else?  Who are we to fix them into a spot that's unfun?  That's the problem I see with fixed flags being interpreted as "fixed forever" rather than "fixed for now, until we decide otherwise."  It has the potential to dead-end fruitful (fun!) paths of exploration in the present because we're still adhering to a vision that was formed some time in the past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97445/#Comment_97445" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T03:25:07+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  3:25AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><br/>So saying "Why not just decide on it in play?" is actually saying "Why not just make everything flexible?"

Ruling out the possibility of a player losing interest in something and forcing him to commit to one specific thing before he even gets to play, doesn't strike me as helpful structure. More like a straightjacketing someone's fun. It's like ruling out multi-classing in D&amp;D.

It certainly wasn't what I meant (or said, looking back.)  What I did mean to say was that I think it has the potential to dead-end fun paths of exploration (not that the idea itself is a dead-end.)  I can see a potential situation in which a player doesn't wish to confront a certain fixed flag any longer, but since it has been agreed that fixed flags are unchangeably fixed, they must either continue in a vein they don't enjoy or create a new character.  This seems like an unfortunate result, given the kind of attachment many people form for their characters.<br/><br/>I like the idea of having flags that are fixed by the player playing the character, and remain static for as long as the player chooses.  This is a signal to the other people at the table that a certain aspect of the character isn't intended to change right now.  If at some point in the future, the player decides that aspect can change, they would simply indicate that the flag is now dynamic.<br/><br/>In summary, fixed flags seem like a useful tool, so long as the game participants are free to exercise their own judgment.  And since they always are, I don't see a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97480/#Comment_97480" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T07:53:01+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  7:53AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember that there's no such thing as "better" design choices, simply choices that are better for certain design goals.<br/><br/>Fixed flags may not work quite as well for long-term play. Maybe, I don't know. (Character class is potentially a flag, and many old-school designs don't allow a character to change their class.) For short term play, though, I don't really see a problem.<br/><br/>Also, remember that flags are just an abstract concept. How they work in play is going to depend on the specific design. Depending on what Tony wants to discuss, it might be beneficial to drop the whole "flag" thing for a bit and simply discuss the underlying phenomena. Players have certain issues &amp; themes they're interested in exploring. Sometimes these issues get resolved. Sometimes they don't.

The resolution is not that it finally does change (though that, too, is an interesting resolution) but that they accept that it isn't going to change.<br/><br/>Again, the setting/situation parallel holds. It could be really interesting to have your character(s) trying to change things in the setting that they have no hope of changing because of their immense inertia, and to specifically mark going in that this will be the case.<br/><br/>"We're going to try to destroy all magic!"<br/><br/>"We're going to overthrow a major government with a small, fanatical group of inexperienced young people!" <br/><br/>"We're going to get the entire Internet to consist of reasoned, nuanced discussion!"<br/><br/>Well, no, you're not.

Fixed flags can be a way to tell the player, "you can't have both things, sorry."<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it might be even more interesting for the character to have a Fixed flag and have <i>one</i> thing he/she wants, but not everything.  So the rabbi can stay a rabbi <i>and</i> be out and proud, but he can't be Orthodox anymore.  He's got to leave his synagogue and the community he's lived in all his life, and find a new way of being.  The warlord can marry the one they love, but the clan of the snubbed bride or groom will go to war to avenge the insult.  Or maybe the warlord will abdicate, has to go on the run with his lover, and will be hunted by his former allies who want to kill him to make a clear path of succession for the new guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's sort of an economic conflict, one good vs. another good.  We do that all the time in story-games, but I'd like to see a strong mechanical support for this kind of drama.  (If someone knows a game that does that, feel free to point it out).<br/>\n<br/>\nDanny<br/>\n*No desire to offend here, it just seems like an impossible situation to be in from where I stand.  Also, Jew vs. Jew conflicts are the last untouched frontier in RPG's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98281/#Comment_98281" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-22T06:56:19+00:00" title="September 22, 2007  6:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2007 7:19AM by Burr.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Threatened self-concepts are the core of modern storytelling, right?  They are what prompts a character to decide upon a primary story goal/question.  So each character should have <i>some</i> flags which are intended to be part of their threatened self-concept, and these should ideally be static <i>until the story is over</i>.<br><br>You can hedge your bets at the beginning by having a threatened self-concept comprised of <i>multiple</i> flags.  That way, at least one should end up <i>having been</i> static.  This means you are constrained but not inflexibly so.  But if you do it that way, you should ensure the character's main goal could plausibly fix the threat to all of them.  This is to make sure the character is pursuing a goal that is wholly relevant to the real story, whatever that may turn out to be in the end.<br><br>If all of your threatened self-concept flags suck, then probably so does your story.  In that case, end the story or deprotagonize the character!  You can't save a story with no core, but you can always focus on a better story or start a new story with similar themes and motifs.<br><br>One way of starting a new story mid-game with deprotagonizing the character might be to introduce a new threat to your character.  Get rid of the old threat, or subsume it into the new threat.  The new threat should focus on different, better self-concept flags than the old threat did.  These flags become static (or ideally so).  The boring, old flags become dynamic, so they can be quietly replaced: they aren't necessarily relevant to the new story.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UbuRex" title="UbuRex"><img alt="UbuRex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UbuRex">UbuRex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98951/#Comment_98951" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T10:53:20+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 10:53AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>Tony, is this still the thread for talking about the use of<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">fixed flags</span>static character qualities?</blockquote>I sure want it to be.<br><br/>I think you're right about the tragic (or at least sad) outcomes, too. I think that people coming to terms with their constraints, and maybe coming to terms with the idea that they [i]cannot be happy[/i] within their constraints, is a cool, melancholy, powerful story element.<br/><br/>They can also be used to convey a moral (perhaps).<br/><br/>Herakles had the static flag of "quick to anger."  Lady Macbeth had the static flag of "ambition."  We know what happened to them.<br/><br/>A couple of rambling observations.  I'm still working a bunch of this stuff out in my head.<br/><br/>1.  if the focus of the story turns on the tension between a character's static flag(s) and one or more other characters/setting elements, then I see two possibilities with regard to the role of the players.  Either the players are supposed to be ritually enacting out a drama according to a formula, or else <b>player input decides the content of the moral lesson being conveyed</b>.  Either the players are supposed to act out the rough arc of Macbeth (ambition leads to destruction), or else they're trying to re-write Macbeth so that Macbeth &amp; co. <b>win</b>.  Which could be awesome, either way.<br/><br/>2.  What about a variant where fixed and dynamic flags are used together, but the dynamic flags can only be "changed" in service of one or more of the fixed flags?  The character with <i>static: ambition</i> also has <i>dynamic: hates the king</i> and <i>dynamic: loves his country</i>.  But he can only change these flags or buy them off if in doing so it furthers his ambition.<br/><br/>Just throwing it on the wall and seeing what sticks.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99062/#Comment_99062" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T15:09:33+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  3:09PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: UbuRex</cite>What about a variant where fixed and dynamic flags are used together, but the dynamic flags can only be "changed" in service of one or more of the fixed flags?
