Feel free to modify it, hack it, steal from it, just give some credit where it's due (I've tried to make sure I've done likewise with the inspirations for the system). For the moment, the files are only on RPGNow, but they will be made available on the Vulpinoid Studios website soon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
