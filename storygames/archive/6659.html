The stories of the other three PCs in that game were good too, but those PCs didn't trade away their lives in the Bizarre Bazaar, and this one did.<br/><br/>Carl&gt;&gt; One PC traded away his life except for 32 minutes, and was very satisfied with the deal, as was his player.<br/><br/>Fred&gt; WOW!  That's a hell of a trade.  What did he get in return?<br/><br/>Nothing, and everything.  I'll attempt to explain.<br/><br/>Noam played Brian, a 25-year old unemployed data entry typist with terminal cancer, who was self-medicating with marijuana and spending the last weeks of life catching up on all the TV shows he'd meant to watch someday, staying up for days at a time to fit it all in.  Locke from "Lost" had just turned to Brian <em>from the TV</em> and warned him to watch out, when a bloody girl came out of his bathroom, said "Help me!" and collapsed on his coffee table. Checking her for wounds he found a wicked curved knife so he was holding that standing over her bloody body when the two cops burst in his door.<br/><br/>...cut to other characters' opening scenes...<br/><br/>So Brian used his "Not being noticed" exhaustion talent and lept out his (luckily first floor) window, then followed the two strangely-dressed cops who beat the girl unconscious and dragged her to a nearby basement.  He used his "Pause/Fast Forward/Rewind" madness talent ("but sadly no volume control") to slip in through the door behind the cops as they put her in an electric chair in the basement.  Madness dominated and with a Fight response he used her knife he was still holding to savagely attack the two cops, splattering their gears and cogs all over the room.  He put the knife back in her sheath and picked her up to take her back outside and call an ambulance, but the door instead opened onto a rooftop in the Mad City.<br/><br/>There he met the other PCs and they got chased, but he held onto the girl as they ran and dodged over the rooftops, and even though she slowed him down, he never let go.  When they reached the Bazaar he rejected many fine offers for the girl, and watched over her in an alley until she woke up.  She looked up at him with a pleased expression and whispered in surprise, "You saved me."<br/><br/>So in the bazaar I throw out all sorts of crazy "goods for sale" cries to see what players might bite on, and he perked up at "new life for old." I thought he might try to cut a deal to cure his cancer, but that wasn't it.  He wanted to trade his life, except for 32 minutes, to the girl.  She protested, but since he'd saved her life she owed him and he made her agree to it.  As a token to contain his life he borrowed her knife (which earlier she'd referred to as her soul, since she's a scissor of course, so if it had been anyone but him to touch her knife she would have gutted them like a fish) to cut off his hair and give it to her, which she very carefully wrapped around the hilt of her knife.  After the 13th hour ended she followed the PCs to a doorway back to the sleeping world. (The Psychic with photographic memory and a regretful past had traded her ring with the memory of her first love for a map to a safe exit from the Mad City, although such maps are ephemeral since things are always shifting, so they had to hurry).<br/><br/>As the door opened and various enemies were closing in she told him, "I'll never sell the memory of your bravery." and then he went through the door without her and back into the sleeping world, where he had just enough time left to finish the last episode of Lost and die peacefully on his couch by himself.<br/><br/>So he still died alone, but now there's someone who'll miss him.  I wish I'd thought to point that out, but I think the player already understood.<br/><br/>Would the player have made the same choice if it weren't a one shot and none of the characters will ever be seen again anyway?  I don't know, but I'd like to think he would.  Something I've learned from <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> is that players are enormously pleased (and sometimes surprised) at the chance to be master of their PC's deaths, perhaps in reaction to all the stupid games where death == failure and the <strong>GM</strong> gets to narrate the most important statement the player can make about what's important to their PC.<br/><br/>I ran a Dogs game recently (at Endgame, not Kublacon) that reinforced that point for me, but good lord this is long enough already.<br/><br/>Another PC got what she needed in a trade, and another PC got what he needed by realized he didn't need to trade, he had it all along, which was an outcome the player really enjoyed.  3.5 hours to explain rules, create characters, and tell a very satisfying story together.  What a great system!  Thanks for writing it, Fred!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
