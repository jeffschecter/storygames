It goes into the core of what rules even are for in games.<br/><br/>My experience agrees with Anon in that rules cannot make people do what they do not want to do. However, I disagree about rules that run along with you: they do not need to get in the way, and in fact should not. People often talk about the rules getting in the way of play, but I think that this is either dissonance (the rules try to do something other than what you want) or a lack of skill in using the rules. (Which does not in any way mean that they are not bad rules, or ill-suited to the capabilities of the players in question. It only means that these players, for whatever reason, are not skilled in using these rules.)<br/><br/>If I had to name what rules are <i>for</i> in roleplaying games, the great majority of what they do pertains to structuring and emphasizing events: you are, from start to finish, doing what you wanted to do, but the rules make it easier to tell whose turn it is to do what, and they provide a stylistic emphasis to the doing in a way that enhances communication. This is highly contrary to the behavioristic viewpoint, which I think is wrong-headed: game rules quite rarely bribe anybody to do things they would not otherwise do, and they cannot make activities pleasurable if the would otherwise be boring. The very best that rules can accomplish is to bring order into chaos, or "murk", as it used to be called at the Forge.<br/><br/>For example, the Keys in TSoY are not there to bribe anybody. They only do two simple things for a group that plays the game facilely: first, they remind players to structure their contributions in a punchier way (in a way that activates Keys, that is to say), and second, they bring a metaphorical trumpet sound to certain thematically resonant activities, in the form of a "Hey, I got XP!" side effect. The overall effect is to make the game more structured and the in-play communication more effective compared to a version of the game that did not have or use Keys.<br/><br/>(Contrast and compare to what Keys do for a group that does not have the skills to use them. Further, what about a group that does not <i>want</i> to do the thing the game assumes you to be doing? For both of those groups the Keys are probably a net loss compared to not having that rule at all. I believe this to be the case for all rules in roleplaying games: if you don't want them or don't know how to use them, it's going to be better to play without any rules at all.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_459435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459435/#Comment_459435" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-20T01:18:06+00:00" title="January 20, 2017  1:18AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2017 1:18AM by AnonAdderlan.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When a person encounters a game which doesn't match their tastes, are they more likely to...\n<ul><li>Play more until they learn to like it.</li><li>Look for a game they like better.</li></ul>\n...and why?\n<blockquote>YOU think your compel is the best thing ever, so cool and engaging.<br/>But maybe I don't see it that way, <b>I don't like your idea</b>, and I would rather spend game resources to not have it</blockquote>\nBut why should it cost you anything to refuse ideas about your character you don't like?\n<blockquote>Or, I like more to portray a successful albeit costly resistance to "a dark urge".happen.</blockquote>\nAnd why isn't presenting a cooler alternative enough?\n<blockquote>Paranoia is not really comparable to this.

Thus, people are often stuck with games they only sort-of like, but not a lot, or with games the intricacies of which they don't quite master.\n<blockquote>But why should it cost you anything to refuse ideas about your character you don't like?</blockquote>\nThat's a discussion I've often had with friends who were designing games, or whom I was designing a game with - defending my position that "vetoes" based in aesthetic dissonance can be structured by a rule, but shouldn't be <i>limited</i> by a rule. My gold standard for that being <i>Archipelago</i>, where you're always allowed to say "Try another way" - there's no limit on how often you can say that.<br/><br/>OTOH, the aesthetic aims of an individual game trump general design principles. In <i>Polaris</i>, other players can and will use the conflict procedure in ways which amount to "taking control" of "your" character, and that's some tight ritual-phrase wrestling you have to do if you want to stop them. You might very well fail at stopping them, or you might end up paying a steep price. That's of course if you interpret "I'm playing Heart to [character]" as "my character", which is probably a simplistic view when you start looking at <i>Polaris</i> closer.\n<blockquote><blockquote>game rules quite rarely bribe anybody to do things they would not otherwise do, and they cannot make activities pleasurable if the would otherwise be boring.</blockquote>\nYet that's exactly what many RPGs attempt to do.</blockquote>\nThat's not limited to RPGs (in fact, I suspect RPGs are generally the most progressive sub-set of games at that) and has long been my beef with the movement called "gameification", as well - though it wouldn't be fair to equate and dismiss gameification with just this sort of behavioral incentives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459441/#Comment_459441" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-20T12:38:42+00:00" title="January 20, 2017 12:38PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2017 12:40PM by Upstart.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If I had to name what rules are <i>for</i> in roleplaying games, the great majority of what they do pertains to structuring and emphasizing events: you are, from start to finish, doing what you wanted to do, but the rules make it easier to tell whose turn it is to do what, and they provide a stylistic emphasis to the doing in a way that enhances communication.

"We're playing this" is very efficient communication compared to detailed explanations of judgment calls typically made at the table. Successfully codifying a set of preferences isn't a small thing. And sometimes it's fun to do stuff the game incentivizes you to do, just to see where it leads.

I don't necessarily think game rules <i>bribe</i> people into doing things they wouldn't do otherwise, but I definitely think that they shape the game and make the game be played in different ways; perhaps, that jives with what you're saying though :-)  for example, I think the experience is very much shaped very differently because of the rules. For example, the game Fiasco and Fall of Magic are very different because of the rules, and the rules definitely shape where the players go, and doing things they may not do otherwise.  I didn't read the whole thread so I might be missing the context. And it's very likely that you may agree with this sentiment, but I've missed the spirit of what you're saying.

I believe that this is true.<br/><br/>However, there is also a common idea in game design that goes further: that a properly designed game can trick the players into acting in desirable ways in the game by providing them with rewards that they find desirable within the context of the game. For example, when a traditional rpg provides characters with experience point "rewards" for the player showing up to play, or for providing entertaining dialogue, or similar feats, the game is engaging in an attempt at behavioral programming: the game makes experience points desirable, and then uses those points as a bribe to make the players do things they would not otherwise do, such as show up to play and roleplay their characters.<br/><br/>AnonAdderlan suggested that what actually happens with behavioristic rules mechanics is that the mechanism is either useless because the player was going to do that thing anyway, or it's dissatisfying (and very possibly dysfunctional) because the mechanism is forcibly requiring the player to play contrary to their creative interests.<br/><br/>I expressed agreement with Anon regarding his point, but because the idea was phrased in a somewhat generalized manner, I also pointed out that there are other reasons aside from behavior modification for rules to exist: Anon suggested that because rules <i>cannot</i> effectively modify behavior, perhaps there is no reason to use rules that will simply accord with what you were going to do anyway. After all, if you were going to e.g. play your character as claustrophobic anyway, what's the point in the rules acknowledging it when you do?<br/><br/>So that's where the bit you quoted comes in: I was explaining how rules that are seemingly behavioristic often have a far more important role as a structural communication tool: the point of e.g. Fan Mail in PTA is not that it bribes you to play well; the point is that the act of giving out the Fan Mail communicates that the event that just occurred in play was appreciated. It's communication, not bribery.<br/><br/>I hope that was clearer. Nevertheless, I don't think that what I think about this matters that much - as long as you know what you think, we're doing just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460335/#Comment_460335" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T21:11:24+00:00" title="February 16, 2017  9:11PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the original proposal is WAY too black &amp; white;  There are many behaviors to which I am indifferent, but in which I will participate with reasonably good cheer if provided a reason to do so. And I might even find that I like it once I get there.  The idea that every behavior someone doesn't take is because they dislike it is... not supportable, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Therefore, if you give people a game that rewards a certain action that they might not otherwise take, you will find that they take it more often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460341/#Comment_460341" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-16T21:40:24+00:00" title="February 16, 2017  9:40PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Eero and Airk.<br/><br/>The issue of "behavioural rewards" comes up every now and then, because many games use mechanical "rewards" to encourage certain types of behaviour. (In one view, this is the ONLY purpose of game design!)<br/><br/>I think it's a tricky topic, because scientific studies show that extrinsic motivation in the form of money/points/rewards don't *work* the way we wish they would. For instance, when you pay someone to carry out good deeds for other people, they might not feel as motivated to do so, or gain the same emotions and benefits, as someone who is driven to do it by intrinsic motivation.<br/><br/>However, the reason there is a big debate about this is that behavioural incentives in games clearly *do work*, either entirely or at various levels. This applies outside gaming, as well. Why do advertising companies and retail business use "rewards" structures to convince people to buy more of their products? Why do people chase after "Likes" on social media?<br/><br/>So, how do we reconcile existing (and successful) game design with the idea that extrinsic rewards don't produce what we're looking for?<br/><br/>I think that, as Eero and Airk point out, the picture is more nuanced than that. If I'm playing a game, and it rewards me for doing something I don't want to do, I'm probably not going to engage with that thing, or do so grudgingly and feel unhappy about it. But is that really what is happening when we play games? Not in my experience.<br/><br/>I think that rewards structures in games do lots of things:<br/><br/>* They allow us to "weight" certain actions against others. For instance, Dogs in the Vineyard rewards you mechanically for using violence. However, the whole premise of the game is to engage you in situations where violence isn't the right (or only) answer. So, the player has to balance these two opposing interests.<br/><br/>* They provide certain expectations. In PTA, Fan Mail tells us that the players are expected to provide feedback on each other's contributions, and, specifically, of the positive kind.<br/><br/>* They give us a means to communicate with each other. If I am supposed to label certain outcomes with XP numbers (e.g. "this quest is worth 2000 XPs"), this gives us a way to establish things in the fiction and our relationship to it. When I assign a high number, that says something meaningful to the other players which I might not have been able to express in other ways.<br/><br/>* They provide pacing mechanisms. Often, a mechanical reward (like XPs, again) exists not to reward someone for a thing, but to delay something we want. "You can't rescue the princess until you've rolled 10 successes and checked off all these boxes." XPs in D&amp;D pace our progression towards magical items, monsters, and character abilities. Similarly, tracking points scored or Stress suffered might be useful as a gauge for other things (like when the GM can bring out a certain monster or another event).<br/><br/>* They give permissions for certain types of actions to take place. Sometimes this is a gentle reminder (again, PTA's Fan Mail reminds you that your opinion matters even when you're not in the scene), and at other times, it's enabling players who might be too shy to say something to do so. <br/><br/>* They play with our interaction with other reward cycles, and create larger dynamics of play. Let's say winning Blue Points allows me to upgrade my character's abilities, but what I really want is for my character to be a good person. However, the rules push me to do bad things... until I can unlock certain abilities which I can use for good. Similarly, D&amp;D's "leveling up" (in certain editions, anyway) doesn't actually increase your power relative to your opponents at all (what it *looks* like it's doing); instead it allows you to explore different aspects of play (different locations, new monsters, new spells, different character goals).<br/><br/>* They allow us to place an emphasis on certain things in play and then to communicate that to others. I write a character's name on a piece of paper, and then I place two tokens on their name. This is communicating to the other players that I see this person as important, and that I want them to interact with other agents in our story (perhaps you must frame a shared scene to score one of those tokens).<br/><br/>Etc.<br/><br/>I really don't think it's as simple as "pull a lever, get a reward". All of this operates in a larger context and creates dynamics in play, by *aligning* itself with player desires, not randomly rewarding behaviours which people *didn't want to engage in* in the first place.<br/><br/>A game which hands out candy when you do X and Y is never going to be successful unless the players are into X and Y for their own benefits. The candy helps accomplish a number of other things, instead.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460489/#Comment_460489" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-21T15:33:44+00:00" title="February 21, 2017  3:33PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good rules make it easier for players to do the things they were going to do anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460490/#Comment_460490" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-21T17:21:43+00:00" title="February 21, 2017  5:21PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, giving players the possibility of forcing a veto acts more like a safety net, an emergency break. Building that into the rules helps that player a great deal to avoid group pressure. I've read so many infuriating stories about people playing a game and suffering through shaming, bigotry and worse that could have been avoided by giving the players the right to veto something as a common action during the game.<br/><br/>In none of those stories I saw a fail at communicating player preferences, but instead it was mostly a matter of group pressure validated by the absence of such rules in the book. Haven't played enough Archipielago to ascertain that "try it another way" solves the problem, but OTOH I haven't read any of those real life horror stories starting with something like "We were playing Archipielago when..."<br/><br/>I perfectly admit that this is an extreme case, but the possibility is there and it seems to happen more usually than we think. I also admit that if people have ill intentions to one another no rule will prevent bad things from happening, but stating that as a reason to remove such simple safeguards from games is akin to removing fire alarms <i>because those won't prevent a place from catching fire</i><br/><br/>OF COURSE, such rules/mechanics could be designed to be less obtrusive and/or central to the game anyway.<br/><br/>And come on, who designs using mechanical rewards anymore?

PCs level up after a big battle or a difficult dungeon, they don't get XP for killing monsters or completing an arc. I try to use Inspiration but keep forgetting, as narrative bonuses often appear by themselves whenever someone roleplays a good scene. If someone brings a good idea to the table, accepting and building on it is often the best reward. Having something interesting happening, either good or bad, as a consequence of the PCs actions does the best work at keeping them motivated. And it seems that for my group, the bigger the risk and the more impact consequences have, the better.<br/><br/>Whenever we have used a mechanic that gave the players a mechanical reward, it has always turned into a button they mash, ruining whatever interesting story bit that could have come from it. It's not like mechanics that produce story won't work. They do, but they do a better work if there's no mechanical reward involved. Because only when there isn't a mechanical reward they focus on the narrative reward. And the emotions we all generate, elicit and share are the best signal that we're doing things right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460539/#Comment_460539" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-22T20:24:02+00:00" title="February 22, 2017  8:24PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Levelling up after a big dungeon or big battle" isn't actually a reward though.

I wouldn't count it always as a pacing mechanism. It's a pacing mechanism when the GM is counting on this to decide "Ok, now they can go to hunt bigger game and finally being able to confront a mid level henchman of the big boss". It's a pacing mechanism also when you can count on the PC new abilities to make some challenges obsolete. There's a difference when players consider facing a group of goblins a huge challenge and when they start to consider killing a Dragon a possibility. But that doesn't likely happen with a single level of difference, you will need like a 5 level difference in D&amp;D to feel it more clearly.<br/><br/>Yet it feels like a reward when players manage to escape alive from the dragon den by making a deal with it and getting trained by the dragon into their next level for the sake of making a quest for such dragon (like kidnapping a princess)<br/><br/>It feels like a reward when the wizard's new spells come from the loot they just found after defeating a big group of goblins they have been tracking for weeks.<br/><br/>There are lot of ways of making it feel like a reward, as long as you narrate them organically as such instead of just saying "ding! you just leveled up!"<br/><br/>Its the same as narrating "you miss" / "you hit", instead of saying "The goblin unexpectedly jumps at you and slides under your feet, as you only manage to cut a few of it's hairs with what would usually been a sure kill attack" / "For a moment it looks like your attack didn't struck as your sword effortlessly comes through the other side of the goblin. Then, the goblin slowly falls in two perfectly symmetrical pieces." You can make sense out of the leveling up mechanic with a couple of excuses and it will make narration a bit less immersion breaking.<br/><br/>For example, I used Fate aspects for a game. Players didn't even bought their compels too much, they just invoked their aspects with a neutral voice and finished their roleplaying saying "...AND I WANT MY DAMN HERO POINT!" It became an inside joke that got repeated through all the campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460553/#Comment_460553" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T02:30:33+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  2:30AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a dynamic that's particular to your play group. <br/><br/>Lots of people don't play that way, and engage with reward mechanisms in other ways (greedily, enthusiastically, ecstatically, emphatically, etc).

I have played plenty of OD&amp;D games with over 50% mortality rates, including games where you level up by beating the dungeon, getting the treasure in its final room, and then spending it.  <i>That</i> level-up is a reward <i>well</i>-earned.<br/><br/>That's an extreme example, but I've played plenty of RPGs where a sense of accomplishment was congratulated by some sort of system reward, and it was fun.  Even just, "In crossing off this item on my 'to do' list, I've unlocked the next one!"<br/><br/>I'd say that, in my experience, system rewards aren't usually the primary motivator of player behavior... but sometimes they are.  Leveling up in OD&amp;D from 1st to 3rd makes you <i>way</i> more survivable, and less likely to have to start over from scratch with a new character after one bad roll or bad decision.  You're also more useful to the party and get more screen time once you level up a few times.  I knew some players who spent a really long time pursuing Level 6, and when they got it, their passion for the game got turned down a lot.  I've never really approached an RPG that way myself, but to each their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460561/#Comment_460561" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T03:07:37+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  3:07AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2017 3:08AM by Airk.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, but if anything was ever "it's own reward" I would think that "not dying" is it.

But I also think rules-contributions can inject all sorts of valuable surprises into play.<br/><br/>Take Sorcerer.  The more useful your demon is, the harder it is to get rid of.  This is codified and enforced in rules and numbers.  I suspect that, ultimately, this reflects a truth that most Sorcerer players are on board with... but that doesn't mean everyone would actually enforce it if left to their own devices.  My favorite Sorcerer character had a pretty satisfying personal transformation away from irresponsible wankery toward actually trying to do some good and get away from demonic stuff, and I imagine my group would have been on board to let me close out his arc by punting his scary demon to the curb.  But the rules said, "Try it, but it's really hard, and requires some luck," and luck wasn't with me.  So it was a bummer in the moment, but more satisfying in the long term, because redemption <i>shouldn't</i> always be easy*.  And I'm more likely to bother to play Sorcerer again because it has its own input rather than just letting me and my friends make the fiction we would have made anyway.<br/><br/>For a different sort of example, there's Burning Wheel -- initially, it doesn't exactly make it easy to succeed at a lot of common things a fantasy character would want to do.  So, as a player, you learn how to play the system so that your stats increase and your ability to do what you wanted to do improves.  The game gets some players to try stuff they know they'll fail at so they can get the reward of improving that skill.  I find this satisfying in a sort of board gamey way, but others like the way it impacts their character play too.  One could call this "jumping through hoops", but they're hoops that can be fun to jump through, especially because learning systems is fun for many (most?) players.<br/><br/>And that's the last type of rules-value that comes to mind: learning the rules.  I have friends who are constantly buying new board games so that they can go through the process of getting good at them.  Once the learning curve slows down, they move on to the next game.  I think that sort of love of learning how a new thing works and how to be good at it is pretty common.  When that's the case, well, rewards help you measure your progress.<br/><br/>* Possibly worth noting, this could be viewed as a sort of simulation.  Whereas GURPS tries to simulate everything, Sorcerer tries to simulate one or two interesting and important things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460568/#Comment_460568" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T03:55:58+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  3:55AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post, Dave.<br/><br/>(Airk, I'm sorry, but I'm not following.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460570/#Comment_460570" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T05:13:52+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  5:13AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>"Levelling up after a big dungeon or big battle" isn't actually a reward though.

Let's also take out XP and leveling since we just got different ways of making them work for different purposes. I'm interested in how do you use other rewards and what kind of fun output/group dynamic you get from them. In particular I'd like to know if:<br/><br/>-Its intuitive or it's something your group has interiorized so much that now they do as a second nature?<br/>-What kind of group reaction a reward elicits in your group? (for both the rewarded person , other group members and the ones giving away the reward)<br/>-Whoever gives away the reward, would you say it's the kind of person that it's hard to get convinced by anything or it's more the kind of person that it's quite emphatic and exteriorized their emotion somewhat effusively?<br/><br/>These may seem like strange questions, but I'm genuinely interested on how you make rewards work, if it's just something I haven't realized about them, if there's a sort of "hidden in plain sight" group mechanic that makes it actually tick, etc.<br/><br/>I mean, I do get a few things about mechanical rewards:<br/>-Once the group gets a bit used to them, It's a good way to signal approbation, recognition; brief and honestly.<br/>-Clear conditions for earning the reward are a must, but when those conditions are too specific of actions that feel boring/uncomfortable/against character or player's nature, the whole thing gets interpreted as a chore (oh, I must act vulnerable now so I can be badass later, meh)<br/>-A symbolic reward is good, but if after receiving it you're left with a valuable resource you can spend on a different source of enjoyment, that's definitely better!<br/><br/>Perhaps these last two points are the source of the problem for my group. While they enjoy it, most of them aren't the kind of players that actively seek for character drama/exploration/development as a main game goal. Mechanics that reward players for this are a chore. They prefer when the system or situation generates this as a byproduct, thus no reward here makes better sense.<br/><br/>Also, they don't link so much an emotional aspect to the mechanical reward. At least they never act grateful for receiving them nor stay in character while they get them. They always interrupt the flow of whatever emotion we were building up as soon as they recognize the chance to earn the mechanical reward they rush the scene and go "...now GIMME MY DAMNED POINTS YO BITCH!". <br/><br/>That's another reason I don't give XP for killing monsters. They are bound to go "uh, it seems I killed the party paladin... accidentally. Well, how much XP do I get from him?" "Dibs on his sword!" and so. It's not like I don't find the fun in all this myself, we are all joking after all, but I also enjoy building a good scene with them from time to time, they have had all their good roleplaying moments and those are the ones we remember the most. So why keep using a game element that ruins that part of the fun before we get to it?

Let's see.  There are basically two types of rewards that my groups deal with with any regularity.  I'll call them "In the moment" rewards (TBZ Aiki chits, and some houseruled stuff, mostly) and "End of session" rewards. (XP in Blades in the Dark, Fate/Persona in Mouse Guard in particular, but also XP in Dungeon World and Monster of the Week) - both of these work pretty well for us, though it's interesting to note that while we play more games with the latter, the former is the one that is more internalized to us.    A lot of the time we find ourselves saying something like "I wish I could give you Aiki for that!" so I guess that one is pretty internalized, but I need to stress that this isn't like, because we've played dozens of sessions of TBZ;  I think the average number of sessions played for this game throughout my groups is probably like... 5.  But it's something that people seem to latch onto in a hurry - across three different groups with pretty minimal overlap, people have "the hang of it" within the first session.   So I guess it's now, if not "second nature" certainly something we intrinsically WANT to do, but it's not because we've totally immersed ourselves into this sort of game, but rather, because every group I've played with has connected with this mechanism.  It's hard to internalize "end of session" rewards as much, because they tend to be part of a special game process at the end of each session.<br/><br/>To segue into the next question, "in the moment" rewards are generally given for any of:<br/>* I thought that description was cool<br/>* That was an awesome one-liner<br/>* That was a totally cool character moment<br/>* OMG that was badass<br/>* OH S**T! <br/>* Nice roleplaying! <br/>* I saw you played your Fate there.<br/>It's very much an expression of appreciation - a means of saying "You upped your game/did a cool thing/improved my experience at the table/advanced the story in a way I found interesting."   I'm not really sure what  you mean by "for both the rewarded person and the other members of the group" though.<br/><br/>For the "end of session" rewards, these are a little bit more mechanized, and generally a little less of a personal thing.  Usually it's "Okay, does anyone think they hit their Belief this session?" and someone steps up and says "Yeah, my belief is "It is never appropriate to yield in the face of threats" and I totally stood up to that weasel!" and everyone around the table nods and agrees and that player gets their reward.  And sometimes someone will say "No, I don't think I did..." and someone else will chime in with "Actually, I thought that when you stepped up in that argument, you were totally defending someone in danger like your Belief says.  It wasn't physical danger, but I think it still counts!" and if the table agrees, a reward is dispensed.  Same thing for Blades where you get XP for expressing your beliefs/ideals/background.  Everyone sortof thinks back on the session and popular consensus rules the day. I guess technically the GM has final say here, but I've never seen him do more than the equivalent of "tie break."<br/><br/>As for the people handing out rewards, since the "end of session" stuff is a group activity, I'd focus on the "in the moment" stuff here.  I can't really say that ANY of us are really the effusive, extroverted type, but we all understand and agree that while this stuff is subjective, it's better to give a reward than not.\n<blockquote><br/>These may seem like strange questions, but I'm genuinely interested on how you make rewards work, if it's just something I haven't realized about them, if there's a sort of "hidden in plain sight" group mechanic that makes it actually tick, etc.<br/></blockquote>\nThat's the thing that confuses me;  I don't feel like we "make" them work - I feel like they work FOR us.  The only thing that I think we do is just play these things according to the spirit of the rules - we do our best to reward the things the rules suggest we reward, and to do so honestly. \n<blockquote><br/>I mean, I do get a few things about mechanical rewards:<br/>[trimmed for space]<br/></blockquote>\nI completely agree with the first two, but I feel there's something wrong if the problem mentioned in point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is happening. (Maybe this is part of why Fate feels weird to me - because Fate points are clearly designed to be an economy of sorts where you need to be less good now to be better later?)  But like... how does it even happen that there are rewards against a character's nature?  Almost all these games, you define a your "flags" and then you get points for doing them.  Don't make your Belief "Always offer comfort to defeated foes" if that's not a thing you are interested in doing.  Heck, in TBZ you get a bunch of "Fates" that you can hit or not hit as you see fit.  Not digging the idea that your character is focused on the loss of your sister?  Don't play that up - you've got 2-4 other Fates lying around, and you defined them yourself, so play up "Hatred for Lord Igehara" instead.  You don't lose anything.\n<blockquote><br/>While they enjoy it, most of them aren't the kind of players that actively seek for character drama/exploration/development as a main game goal.

That's silly.  Also, don't play D&amp;D if you're not interested in killing monsters and taking their stuff.  I don't understand how this is even a thing.  Though it also sounds like you are playing games that do this badly if you are running into the problem you describe in point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.\n<blockquote><br/>They always interrupt the flow of whatever emotion we were building up as soon as they recognize the chance to earn the mechanical reward they rush the scene and go "...now GIMME MY DAMNED POINTS YO BITCH!". <br/></blockquote>\nTo me, this is just your players being ***holes and would be considered a breach of social contract at my table.

But if it's a thing that you don't really have strong feelings about, rewards can easily propel you into doing that, or just act as a guide when you're considering what to do.  "I'm not really sure what my character would do here... but I get a reward if I address this challenge with threats, so hell yeah! I tell this guy "Say that again and I break your leg.""  To me, it sounds like your group is actively disinterested in the game you would like to play.  Rewards won't magically fix that.

I'm talking about the big stuff, the things character arcs are made of.  The way you make your Coward character eventually BECOME a "Brave" character.<br/><br/>On my end, I compare Fate to say, Burning Wheel.  If I have a Belief "I won't risk my own skin to help anyone else."  But then decide, no god dammit, my brother IS more important than that, I'll likely get rewarded even for playing AGAINST that belief.  Meanwhile, in fate, you, the player, not the character, get taxed for making those tough decisions, or might not even be able to make them at all if there was a costly conflict last scene.

Great, I can't wait to do that!"<br/><br/>They communicate expectations and reward for us doing what we're already excited to do; they're not effective motivators (as the science shows).<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons XP in D&amp;D works well for some people: setting up XP rewards for specific actions or achievements is a very powerful way of communicating expectations about the game. "Hey, I think it's cool if adventurers try to outsmart monsters instead of defeating them, so they can escape with the treasure." Great, then you should XP for gold (treasure), or XP for encountering monsters or avoiding them (instead of killing them). "I'd like for characters to have individual quests or goals." Great, let's assign XP values to heroic "Quests", and let characters choose theirs. "I'd like for reward and challenge to be proportional and easy to gauge." Great, then XP awards should be based on the difficulty of encounters. (And maybe they should be declared publicly before players decide to engage with a particular adventure - "This is a 5,000 XP adventure." "Man, that's probably going to be too hard for us. Let's come back to it later.")<br/><br/>Placing an XP reward on something gives the group a way to communicate what they're excited to see in play, and then serves to signal when it's being achieved.<br/><br/>Sometimes this happens in less obvious ways - for instance, you could indicate that your character is particularly motivated for a personal goal because she is willing to FORGO an award to pursue it, and that might lend a certain emphasis on that decision for your group.<br/><br/>Engaging with any game rules should give a clear payoff that everyone is excited about; otherwise, of course it's not going to be a whole lot of fun. When the rewards are being given out or assigned, there should be some enthusiastic approval all around the table, or... something needs to change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460612/#Comment_460612" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T20:35:26+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  8:35PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, now I see it clearer! Thanks a lot everyone! Ok, definitely my group needs some of this. I think I still have some resource that can be refilled through roleplaying, after all my last homebrew design has a couple of things hacked from TBZ.<br/><br/>The characters my group makes do have interesting flags, but having our sessions each two weeks is enough to forget them. Most usually, on the next session, if I haven't paid enough attention to their character sheets we will miss of roleplaying all that cool stuff they made up along with their character. So, using the last part of the session to award them a reward for playing and evolving those flags? That's the best reminder ever. <br/><br/>I prefer it to be the last part of the session as we always have a somewhat weak session ending anyway. People all leave at different moments and it's difficult to know in advance when, so it's hard to come up with a proper cliffhanger moment to end the session. It's also less immersion-breaking.<br/><br/>I'm all in favour of letting them change those flags if they completely forget about them and pick up new ones from anything in the game they find interesting. I was already planning to give them a journal for them to write down some notes after each session but this looks better.<br/><br/>I'm still kinda against XP, as having everyone level up according to how much screen-time the managed to squeeze from the session and how well they fared through it becomes a bit unfair sometimes with our group. There are some people better at this than others, so much that they have a history of ending up outclassing the rest of the party and thus getting even more screen time, because levelled up characters get more agency anyway.<br/><br/>As for "in the moment" rewards, we are quite enthusiastic and emphatic already about everything that happens on the table so I think we can skip that. The less mechanics distracting us, the better. Now this sounds like interesting mechanical rewards!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460614/#Comment_460614" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T20:43:03+00:00" title="February 23, 2017  8:43PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2017 9:11PM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Also, Warriormonk, I've been thinking about your comment where you say that the players "rush the scene" so they can go "Gimme mah points!" - why is this?

It was just whoever roleplayed the scene realized quickly that if he overacted their next line a bit and spouted their aspect it was obvious he should be getting a fate point. So much that they stopped doing the effort and made the joke of immediately claiming their reward. Such gag ended turning into a recurrent one and soon players werent roleplaying to their fullest anymore. Back when we played without such rewards we had better, more memorable moments, but now it was clear we were just ruining the atmosphere before these were happening.<br/><br/>Those jokes didn't marked the end of the scene, I just handed the point and we continued without more pause than enough for everyone to stop laughing.<br/><br/>EDIT: reading more calmly now:<br/><br/>One little thing: interiorization doesn't always take too long. We usually interiorize quite quickly how to roleplay, usually after one session or two. Things like when we should be rolling dice, ritual phrases that trigger that or are used to avoid that, gestures the GM uses to signal us how big is a room or enemy, ways everyone signals their approval/recognition, etc. If we are new to roleplaying with a group we interiorize their social contract little by little; we start with some cautious moves and watch their feedback, lower our guard sooner or later, find the limits and get used to them.<br/><br/>Then we see how this social contract gets imported to the next game the group plays and how the contract is modified by the particular mechanics of that game. We keep using the same slang and gestures and add new ones from the game, maybe replace old ones. It's there in how your players now use aiki as a slang for recognition, even after just 5 sessions of TBZ.<br/><br/>In comparision, our group inherited several toxical behaviors from different players. We had one that had a bit of a tourette syndrome and couldn't stand emotional/dramatic scenes. He couldn't help but ruin those moments with innuendo, so much that even when he was gone doing those jokes from time to time became a habit for the group. Now it's there in the threshold of the group's tolerance to the change in atmosphere. So much that a simple reward mechanic that makes the scene feel a bit artificial is enough to trigger it. And on top of it we developed a tolerance for that breaking of the social contract. It became part of our social contract to tolerate it.<br/><br/>Well, that's our group. How often does this happen with other groups? Hmmm, well I'd bet that it's enough to explain why we haven't seen too many new designs using the same mechanics becoming incredibly popular... And yet not enough that you would see a lot of people complaining about it to the creators that they would eliminate the mechanic in later editions of their games anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460626/#Comment_460626" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-23T22:06:43+00:00" title="February 23, 2017 10:06PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2017 10:07PM by Airk.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>We didn't do it at the end of the scenes.

It is a pretty bog standard behavioral reward incentive along the lines of Fate points (though it's a relatively weak implementation) and it's in literally the only "incredibly popular" RPG... more or less ever.  So again, I don't think there's any basis for your claim that rewards mechanics like this are being frowned on because there aren't any "incredibly popular" games using them.<br/><br/>And I confess, I don't honestly understand why being too old of friends makes it impossible for you to take something seriously, but I'll take your word for it.

While self-compels are a thing, most compels are, I think, supposed to come from other players/the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

happen when we feel like it. The way we had been using the mechanic was preventing those moments from happening at all. Now I get that there's no way to force those things to happen, any mechanic pointing in that way is supposed to be an incentive/recognition for something the players already want to do. A reminder of sorts: "hey, we wanted this to happen from the start of the game, let's keep it going and evolving!"<br/><br/>But phrase or use it wrong, or -especially- on things that the players aren't interested into and no matter how good the mechanic is or how cool dramatic moments it could produce, the players and the GM will find a way to ruin it. The reward will never be in the rules but in how, when and why the group uses them, and what meaning they give to those rewards.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460689/#Comment_460689" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T04:38:17+00:00" title="February 25, 2017  4:38AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>But phrase or use it wrong, or -especially- on things that the players aren't interested into and no matter how good the mechanic is or how cool dramatic moments it could produce, the players and the GM will find a way to ruin it.

Again;  You can't overcome negative bias with a reward, but you can absolutely promote positive bias where there was previously no opinion, and without the rules, this doesn't really work.  But this is no different from "If you force everyone at your table to play Call of Cthulu and everyone hates Lovecraft, it doesn't matter how good the game is, no one will enjoy it." or "If you loathe puzzle games, the fact that Tetris has a scoring system isn't going to make you want to play it, but people who enjoy Tetris will enjoy trying to beat their high score."<br/><br/>If it were just about how the reward is used by the GM, then saying "Good job " would be all that's required, and it's not.  The rules provide the framework and power for the incentives.  The reward is absolutely in the rules. But like everything in the rules of RPGs, if you don't do it right, the rules can't actually stop you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460691/#Comment_460691" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T06:14:21+00:00" title="February 25, 2017  6:14AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is actually the inverse of the Oberoni Fallacy, which I proposed calling the Deliverator Corollary. <br/><br/>The Oberoni Fallacy is essentially "System Doesn't Matter because the GM is empowered to change any rule that doesn't work for a particular group." It's a fallacy because a changed design says nothing about the qualities of the original work.<br/><br/>My Corollary is that no amount of good game design can overcome unwillingness to follow the rules of that game.<br/><br/>If you think about it, there's actually some real Godel-Escher-Bach shit in there: no system is (or can be proven to be) self-consistent.

I meant a bit more and I'll ask you to allow me to expand on my current opinion:<br/><br/>Rewards work for you. Didn't worked for me, but after I heard how you used them and we discussed it, I realized my problem was <br/><br/>   40% my group's disposition to do certain things<br/>   30% we were using the wrong words to explain/trigger the mechanics<br/>   10% using things at the wrong time<br/>   10% the precedent settled by my friend with the tourette syndrome<br/>   10% me not helping at all since I understood the mechanic in the wrong way.<br/><br/>I expected it to change how my group played without knowing there's no way to do that, unless they feel okay about playing a totally different game and we make that clear from the start.<br/><br/>So, how you introduce the reward rules, the words you use for them, the situations you apply them to, how you policy their use and abuse, all that matters.<br/><br/>It matters so much that things that normally wouldn't be considered a reward (like levelling up) can be presented as such with the right words. I mean, what if you do something so good as a player that the GM instead of just giving you a bit of XP says "I'll give you enough XP for you to get to the next level". Then next time the GM says "you get to level up" becomes a phrase that resumes that expression by extension. Then the GM finds out that it's easier for him to give out levels instead of calculating XP per encounter, especially if he's using random encounter tables or lots of impro and prefers to keep the game going instead of interrupting it to consult the manual. Also, players all having the same level helps a bit to find better combat/spotlight balance.<br/><br/>I'll take back what I wrote about popular/impopular game mechanics. It's too biased and I would need much more data on things like distribution, sales and well, popularity polls anyway to even call it a right hunch. I admit it just looks like that to me from here, through the narrow window of SG opinions on designs in the past few years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460703/#Comment_460703" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-25T20:32:37+00:00" title="February 25, 2017  8:32PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good analysis, WM. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460721/#Comment_460721" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T03:03:40+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  3:03AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that there HAS been a "trend" of some rather "freeform" roleplaying games appearing in the last few years, so, in that respect you are correct.<br/><br/>However, to see this as an obvious and overwhelming change in RPG design in general seems to me to be rather... odd. For starters, D&amp;D (the biggest name in the business) has clear mechanical rewards (and, in fact, more so than ever before). All Fate and Fate-based games do. (They seem to be relatively unpopular among the current S-G crowd for personal reasons, but are very popular otherwise.) Likewise, all (or almost all) the "PbtA" games (starting with Apocalypse World) have very clear mechanical rewards.<br/><br/>I don't pretend to know what percentage of "popular games" these three areas alone comprise, but, considering how many "PbtA" games are coming out and being played (I'm hearing about entirely PbtA game conventions, for instance), and then furthering considering that (as far as I know) D&amp;D may still hold a majority of the market share just by itself, I think it would be really bizarre to say that - again, just these three categories! -these games are an outlier, exceptions to a larger trend.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460722/#Comment_460722" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T03:11:59+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  3:11AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're quite correct about the players' disposition towards the game mattering a great deal.<br/><br/>For instance, your approach to "leveling up" (as you describe it) ignores certain key rules in order to <i>take away</i> any of the impact of XP gaining and leveling. If you hand out levels arbitrarily, and strive to keep all the characters at the same level, it no longer functions as a meaningful reward at all. Of course no one is going to be in any way motivated by XP and leveling in such a game (not should they), because its impact has been entirely subverted by the way you're playing the game.<br/><br/>Deliverator's got it! For instance, the rules of Chess reward careful thinking and strategic play. However, put two players who aren't interested in strategic competition in front of a Chess board, and no level of good design is going to make them play accordingly.<br/><br/>(Fortunately for Chess players, the game - unlike RPGs - is limited enough that it usually doesn't take people too long to realize that they aren't getting much out of it without engaging the strategy. They either quit or start trying to outmaneuver each other. Something like D&amp;D, though, has enough other business going on that you can get sidetracked and still keep playing. This was sometimes referred to as "Drift" on the Forge, and is pretty common in RPG play, I think.)<br/><br/>"If you outsmart me, you get to take one of my pieces and thereby get closer to winning."<br/><br/>If that doesn't excite you to play - if you don't see the connection between playing the game and this advantage - then you shouldn't play Chess.<br/><br/>"If your character takes [dramatic action we agreed is interesting], you get one of these Super Points, and thereby get closer to [achieving a game state we're excited to see, like a heroic victory]."<br/><br/>If that dynamic isn't immediately interesting and exciting to all the players - then you shouldn't play that game, either.<br/><br/>(Of course, sometimes you have to play the game first, to see it in action. But the principle applies all the same - now that you have played, how do you feel about it?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460750/#Comment_460750" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T16:27:56+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  4:27PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>For instance, your approach to "leveling up" (as you describe it) ignores certain key rules in order to <i>take away</i> any of the impact of XP gaining and leveling.

I'll try to give more clues about this: <br/><br/>-<i>It's not totally arbitrary</i>. I mean, okay, "players level up when the DM says so" is arbitrary but that doesn't entirely describe what we're doing. The conditions we use can be reduced to: a) PCs level up right after facing a big challenge. b) exception to a is that PCs won't level up on two sessions in a row. <br/>-<i>It isn't something granted.</i> I keep putting challenges in front of the players but I'm not using the encounter calculator. They are entirely free to avoid or run away from an encounter, try following other storyline, etc. So its up to them when leveling up happens. We just agreed that it won't be on the next session right after they have leveled up.<br/>-<i>Players still have to gain it. </i>Given these conditions, players now know they won't just level up in a couple of sessions if they do nothing. They most probably won't level up either if they do too little. It's only when their characters are tested to their limits that they earn that right. No mechanic can actually measure this objectively, any DM would have a hard time trying to doing this objectively, but I'm glad to try as hard as I can for the sake of the group's fun. It has worked so far.<br/><br/>Now, can it be better? OF COURSE. Can it be more objective, turn it into an experience other groups could replicate? I'd like to think so, haven't thought so far of this. Already works as a reward the way it is? YES and you can have my word on this.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460754/#Comment_460754" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T18:22:38+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  6:22PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I submit that levels are not working as a reward in your game.<br/><br/>Do you think your players would actually be avoiding big fights if they weren't guaranteed to level up after them?<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm having a hard time understanding how your system even functions.

It <i>happens</i>. It's either a series of bad rolls and decisions that turn an otherwise easy encounter or even a non-combat situation into a life-or-death battle or player's interests taking them into really dangerous places without looking out for some info about it first.<br/><br/>There's even a chance that they turn a purposely prepared hard or lethal encounter into a half-assed roleplayed scene without even knowing. Happened two sessions ago in our campaign.<br/><br/>An example of a different situation: At the start of the campaign they went to an ancient cursed battlefield to get basic magic weapons and equipment. They even managed to find a helpful guide and just had to get out of the place before sunset or face a medium encounter (I was still using the encounter balance rules back then) <br/><br/>But in the end they decided to stay far too long, a small group of skeletons appeared, lead by a watered-down wraith. The enemies were missing most of their attacks at the PCs... until one of the players risked using a magic staff that they hadn't identified yet and gave their opponents a fire aura that added 1d6 of fire damage to their 1d4 attacks. That broke the encounter... until the player who had used the staff found out that he could turn that power off at will just by using the staff again.<br/><br/>They came 2 HP close of defeating the wraith but ended up running away when I thought they were about to give it the definitive strike. One PC had fell unconscious and it turned out a couple others were badly wounded.<br/><br/>I had to give them a level up. They totally earned it. <br/><br/>After that I dropped the encounter calculations, took note on their HP and started to adjust monster stats. I reduced their damage when needed and added variety to their attacks and tactics instead of using the monster manual RAW. It's been working better.<br/><br/>Allow me to put it this way:<br/>giving levels = giving big chunks of XP. <br/>I'm just not bothering with the math anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460761/#Comment_460761" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T21:55:29+00:00" title="February 27, 2017  9:55PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How transparent is it to the players, or even to yourself? <br/><br/>It doesn't sound like you're saying, "Hey, if you beat these skeletons and this wraith, you will level up." It's more like, they finish beating some monsters and you think, "Well, that was hard. I guess that was worth a level."<br/><br/>I play a character in a Pathfinder campaign that is run that way and I'll be frank: it's a bit unsatisfactory. Sometimes I feel like we should have leveled, and we didn't. Sometimes it feels like the GM doesn't level us because his prep was done at a certain level, but that might just be paranoia.<br/><br/>I like how <i>13th Age</i> handles it. Four good "adventuring days," where each day consists of four solid encounters. Two consequences of that:<br/><br/>1. You don't refresh daily powers or spells until you've finished four solid encounters, even if ten days pass in the game. End of the "five minute adventuring day."<br/><br/>2. It's clear that you complete 16 solid encounters, you get to level up.<br/><br/>"Solid encounter" usually means monsters or traps, but I general extend it to include any role-playing encounter of reasonable duration that carries an interesting risk.<br/><br/>And a cool thing <i>13th Age</i> can do with this, as a result, is that you get these mid-level power-ups where you get to pick one small bit of your next level and gain that ability before you actually reach the next level: Maybe you get more hit points, or an ability score increase, or a new class power, or a new spell.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_460765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460765/#Comment_460765" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-27T22:41:23+00:00" title="February 27, 2017 10:41PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2017 10:44PM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> It's more like, they finish beating some monsters and you think, "Well, that was hard. I guess that was worth a level."<br/></blockquote>\nThis exactly, though I would add an exclamation point at the end of that phrase. Hear me here: I said before that it isn't perfect. It's not a rule, not even a proper procedure. It's just me reading the atmosphere of the session and the pulse of the campaign. Possibly it's just my instinct that makes it work. Possibly my friends know me well enough to trust me on this. I keep asking them for feedback on the same day of the session and on days later. I keep checking their reactions to each twist and adjusting accordingly. Definitely it ain't math. As good as rules and procedures can be, actual roleplaying isn't clockwork. <br/><br/>It doesn't mean that there's no science here, just that it isn't precise because part of it is based on emotions and thus, not measurable. Part of why this works is because this is taking advantage of a mechanism of the human memory. It turns out that most of the time we remember more clearly the emotions conveyed in things said to us (and thus their meaning) than the exact things that were said. I've got a poor memory enough to testify that btw.<br/><br/>So, handle levels like a reward, at the appropriate moment and voil\xe1, they will feel like a reward. Handling them to everyone in the group its just pointing that it was for a group effort. It's actually that simple. Come on, it's like giving XP for roleplaying! I'm not even inventing anything new!<br/><br/>And what kind of skills must one develop for that? Well, the same ones that make you want to applaud an artist after a performance or express your thanks/appreciation to anyone you work closely with after seeing them work really hard.<br/><br/>Now please note that I didn't wrote "levels are the best rewards and everything else sucks". I wrote "It <b>feels</b> like a reward for the players (referring here to <i>my group</i>), mostly because of when and how it's used."<br/><br/>Oh, and about unsatisfactory rewards: any reward can feel poor or unsatisfactory; sometimes because it isn't what we wanted or what we feel we deserve. Other times it just comes at the wrong time, from the wrong person or it's phrased with a poor selection of words.
