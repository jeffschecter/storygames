(and not just "inspired by it": God of War---&gt;AGON etc). Anyone have a setting that they want to at some point pull and turn into a tabletop experience?<br/><br/>In my case, I believe that the only true CRPG to TRPG crossover that I've done was Fallout, played with Unisystem (Buffy/Angel-inspired).<br/><br/>I like the weirdness of <b>Morrowind</b> (Oblivion was a snorefest setting-wise), but the shlocky "a dozen races all mashed together" is kinda blaaah. I prefer settings with 1-3 playable races, tops.<br/><br/><b>Dragon Age</b> is kinda cool. I mean, it's basically LOTR made sliiightly edgier. And every male in the kingdom wears hairstyles that I've seen at one time or another on Kevin Sorbo (save for the Cornrows, the only one).<br/><br/>I really like the dark fantasy feel of the game <b>Demon's Souls</b>, but there's not a lot of deep "setting" there, just a tone (dark monsters in a light realm, with a bit of mysticism), a cosmology (multiple realms, The Nexus), and badass monsters that will murder you over and over until you overcome: The only way to properly emulate this on the tabletop is for every single roll roll a companion 1d8: If you roll an 8, you die, the end: Start over. However, out of all of these on my list, I think that Demon's Souls is the one I'm most attracted to actually running/playing.<br/><br/><b>Mass Effect</b> I believe has some appeal: I have not played those (I have PS3, not XBox) but they seem pretty tight and sufficiently fantastical.<br/><br/>Thoughts on other console/computer settings?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244613/#Comment_244613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T09:08:59+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  9:08AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2009 9:10AM by Tristan.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have wanted to play a <b>Leyend of Zelda</b> game since I first met role playing games.

I'd definitely be interested in non-RPG games converted to tabletop games. Mario Bros is one I keep circling around. Street Fighter is a favorite example of one that actually truly exist(s/ed).  These are fun because they get to add so much to the world, and embellish the pure gamey aspects of the game.  The Sims would be an interesting head trip - and possibly the soap opera RPG we've been waiting for*.<br/><br/>But converting CRPGs (and movies and TV shows**) are rarely fun. The world is already developed, but it's sometimes a nice reference for that, and then we just get Dice Mechanic A and Rules Structure C. Plus, Dragon Age is Standard Fantasy World B, the only thing making it unique is Bioware's excellent story and game design (both of which are required items for chopping block in a table top conversion). Yawn and snooze.  You'd be better served by taking your favorite generic or flexible system and buying the Prima or Brady guide.<br/><br/>I'd be interested in seeing tons of games, in other words. None of them CRPGs.  Platformers (Mario, Sonic, Ratchet &amp; Klank, Mega Man). God games, Populous, Black &amp; White, SimCity, Civilization. Sandbox games, Grand Theft Auto, Infamous, [Prototype], The Sims. Shooters, Doom, Quake II, Half Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead. Casual games, Puzzle Pirates, Bookworm, Cafe World.<br/><br/>*Or no one's been waiting for, but still awesome.<br/><br/>**There are good exceptions, like Buffy and Ghostbusters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244651/#Comment_244651" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T11:48:51+00:00" title="December  2, 2009 11:48AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>Street Fighter is a favorite example of one that actually truly exist(s/ed).</blockquote><a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/dungeons-and-dragons/wtf-street-fighter.php" rel="nofollow">Seriously?

Trying to do <i>LOTR</i> or <i>Star Wars</i> and be around the main characters doesn't work; similarly, trying to play in a fictional space which is predominantly defined by the main characters (oh... <i>The Office</i>, maybe?) breaks down fast. And I'd suggest that's because those aren't Settings, they're Situations (Setting + Character). Strip the Character, and many, many Situations leave almost empty characters. Conversely, good fodder fo "RPG conversion" are Situations with generic (or innumerable) Characters and/or VERY rich Settings, with a lot of space for a lot of principle Characters.<br/><br/>Which made me think "sandboxes" in my earlier post.<br/><br/>(And I *our* Star Wars game, we took over the Death Star and took it to the Empire's ASS. Luke and Leia and that lot were just too fucking LATE to be relevant... but, you know, they're Jedi and pretty good in a fight.

So if you've played the Rune RPG (which I have) you can answer yes to Andy's question.<br/><br/>There's definitely some LoTR features in Dragon Age...you'd be hard pressed to push my "feels familiar" button without touching on LoTR somewhere.  But I really like the details.  I like the Bannorn being a region of freeholding Bans (barons) who were subjugated by a number of warlords (some T-word that equates to a duke), one of whom declared himself king, and weaned the T-word guys down to just two subordinate to him.  They then elevated certan Bans to the title of Arl (Earl) to help control their neighbors, but didn't quite manage to snuff the independence of the Bans (who are free to choose which Arl they'll serve and change at will) and who wield some outsized political power when they gather for a Landmeet.  All of which is familiar enough to work with but I've never seen that precise arrangement before in a fantasy setting.  <br/><br/>I'm similarly fond of the relationship between the Chantry, the Circle of Mages, and the Templars.  Again, not revolutionary, but really well done, and even deeper when you start to uncover the history of Andraste in the game and how she (and thus the Chantry) intersect with the Teventors and the Dalish<br/><br/>As a setting it has a lot of believable groups of people behaving in believable (and neither black nor white) ways with lots of grist for conflict beyond the actual story line of the CRPG game.  Alot of other CRPG settings have cool imagery but the actual conflict is so focused on the game's story-line that there often isn't much else to do there.<br/><br/>What makes the setting interesting for me is that nearly every historical event you can find 2 or 3 different perspectives on in the game, which makes the fictional history feel much more like real history.  Too often in an RPG setting the history is presented as Fact From the Game Designer Delivered Unto Thee, which winds up feeling totally artificial because no matter how many different opinions you put into characters you know unequivicably which characters are canonically right and which are wrong.  Presenting the history of the world through actual character voices or books written by fictional characters feels a lot more solid to me, even if that's just a pure psychological effect.<br/><br/>Andy, are you playing Dragon Age?  If so did you go through the Soldier's Peak premium content adventure (where you reclaim the old Grey Warden Keep)?  If so...the story of the Sophie Dryden and the siege of the castle by the king 100 years ago is a great illustration of this...also the core Dalish / Werewolf story though that was a little more clipped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244710/#Comment_244710" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T16:43:16+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  4:43PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to play a Jade Empire game.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244727/#Comment_244727" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T19:19:52+00:00" title="December  2, 2009  7:19PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I had to pick a CRPG to make into a tabletop RPG I'd pick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Ends_with_You" rel="nofollow">The World Ends With You</a> hands down. I'm not quite sure how the hell you would transfer the crazy game mechanics to the tabletop, but the setting and the story are just so awesome that I just want to explore them more. <br/><br/>Actually, most of the video games I'd love to see as RPGs (paper mario, shadow of the colossus, pokemon,  no more heroes) would be exceedingly difficult to map to the tabletop, but if they <i>were</i> pulled off well they'd be excellent for sure, because then I'd be able to call up the awesome experience of playing that game whenever I wanted, and to be able to explore the world as I want to, not as the game progresses.
