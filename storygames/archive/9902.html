That is, not just the rules as written, but also rules not used/modified and other understandings. That stuff is the Actual System).<br/><br/>The question came up for me recently when I began asking about a game that I'd bought and would like to run, but haven't yet. I discovered after asking some questions at the game's yahoo group that in practice, successful convention games normally involved quite a bit that wasn't really emphasized in the rules text, and that the game itself was often modified fairly heavily even by the author.<br/><br/>So what about it folks? How do you record and organize and emphasize what is actually important to successful play of your game, and have you run into circumstances where a rules text was somewhat or ver much at odds with <b>succesful</b> actual play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220099/#Comment_220099" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T10:01:55+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 10:01AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To quote Jules from Pulp Fiction: "But I'm tryin'.

Each rules chunk ends with a "Things to look for" section, with advice and suggestions, like:<br/><br/><i>Here's an important point - your guy may not be in trouble.  The game's central dilemma may not be about your character at all - maybe he's a distant relative, or a do-gooder, or just collateral damage. If it turns out your guy isn't in a jam as the game begins, focus on making the jam more intense until it touches him, too. Trust me, eventually it will.</i><br/><br/>So I'm using that to describe a style of play beyond the procedures, after they are laid out.  Making this explicit was, I believe, Ralph Mazza's suggestion and it is a great one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220105/#Comment_220105" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T10:17:03+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 10:17AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I have a question though.<br/><br/>Do you leave these things as advice and suggestions, as "This would make your game better", or are you making it free-sentence rules, such as, "If your protagonist isn't in a jam, push until they are"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220110/#Comment_220110" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T10:29:50+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 10:29AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The former, structurally.

The dynamics you need, or can expect to get, between the players is one of the hardest to put your fingers on sometimes. <br/><br/>Our group played 3:16 recently, and the mechanics of that game put the characters at odds with one another--you have very different goals depending on what your rank is. This means that you can easily do some moves which are true to the character, but which dick over the other players. If folks aren't expecting this, hard feelings can ensue.  Heads ups about this kind of player/character overlap and conflict might help set the expectations, but then it does seem obvious from reading the directives for the character ranks!<br/><br/>Another cautionary tale here, I've seen this happen many times too--when mentioning a neat aspect of a game that arises from play (having lots of guns in Dogs has consequence for the actions you take in character) <b>at the start of the game</b> can prime people to do something to avoid, or court, that effect. But it can throw other things out of wack.  The player I'm thinking of heard this about the game (I shot my mouth off) then chose to have no gun whatsoever, and had some issues dealing with normal things that came up in the game. Not that that's a bad thing in Dogs, but I wish I'd allowed them to go in with no expectations and learn for themselves what the game communicated to them.<br/><br/>I realize this is a bit contradictory. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Do we set expectations or not?<br/><br/>I like Jason's example. It points out potential problems, and then gives a simple directive for how to allow the game to correct itself. Not raising expectations too high, I think, but giving another avenue for action if things are not quite right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220127/#Comment_220127" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T11:04:05+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 11:04AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my questions is: How do people organize this stuff, in the text?<br/><br/>It strikes me that a lot of player-level stuff in games tends to get put near the back of the book, rather than upfront.<br/><br/>Is there a way to really drill down and basically force the reader to put that stuff first in their mind, before going on to the more traditionally mechanical bits?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220128/#Comment_220128" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T11:08:22+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 11:08AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could definitely reverse the traditional order.

Because these are the places where the non-mechanical system needs to come in or the game will be less fun. <br/><br/>I've used examples to offer some of the dice handling and other tricks that arisen from dozens of games but ultimately, I've seen quite a few groups of players drift the rest of the game mechanics and still have just as much fun with the game. Because combined with the core rules (which are simple enough), the underlying dynamics of the game are insensitive to a variety of other changes in the social assumptions. The fun, as it were, serves as an attractor, and that brings the game into focus, even when players have added some fairly interesting rule constraints to their playtest. <br/><br/>But admittedly, that's because my publication philosophy is that it isn't enough to design a game that plays well if the instructions are followed. I want to publish a game that plays well even if players don't do everything as instructed, in short a game that is actually robust. And I don't see how you can do that while ignoring the non-mechanical parts of the system.<br/><br/>  - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220153/#Comment_220153" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-22T12:32:34+00:00" title="July 22, 2009 12:32PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the actual case I was thinking of ( <i>Astounding Tales </i>by Howard Whitehouse) there was some actual very key stuff that was never discussed at length or emphasized, and which I only discovered after questioning some folks on the yahoo group for the game. Without that info, I had a very different impression (or at least a very vague one) about how the games being played at conventions ( which were getting great feedback reports) were actually accomplished. Here are just a few things I found out:<br/><br/>1) Despite the fact that these games are regularly being played as one-off participation games at conventions, that wasn't really any involved discussion of putting one together at all.<br/><br/>2) The games are generally run by the author with up to a dozen players, plus helpers.<br/><br/>3) The author tends to run a sort of short interview of the players before the game to decide how he assigns the characters. This is important as the characters tend to be based on either very store sterotypes or fictional pulp or cinema characters.<br/><br/>4) The "bad guys" players are informed that the Good guys <b>must</b> eventually win the scenario, and are then given some advice on "hamming up" the bad guys. IOW, Bad Guy Players are both players and a sort of mini GM/adversity generator.<br/><br/>5) Players will tend to each control a team of characters. This actually flies directly in the face of stuff discussed in the book. They'll also be assigned pregens almost always, despite several slightly different chargen methods given in the rules.<br/><br/>Anyway, this along with some other tidbits are all things not really discussed at length, that clearly make a huge difference to me.

The hard part is likely realizing when they are important to the game, and then putting into words how someone else can implement the things you find make it work well. And then again, the implementation can vary so much based on the individual situation. <br/><br/>It's too bad we don't have a language for these things like musicians do.

And no that's not going to be a perfect translation between music and gaming but it sounds pretty usable to me. I mean I don't think it's the lack of <i>notation</i> that's the issue so much as the lack of <i>specific styles to notate</i> -- starting by ripping off music or film seems pretty natural, and I think a lot of games/gamers do already talk about this in terms of 'mood' for a scene. <br/><br/>Pushing that envelope with more specific prompts and more sudden shifts mid-scene sounds cool, though. I think in general most games could be a lot more aggressive in terms of explaining/demanding the sort of play they are made for, and/or enabling players to do the same.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220286/#Comment_220286" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T08:56:34+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  8:56AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Care to expound a bit?</blockquote>Mostly I just imagine how Paul Tevis would explain the rules of my game, and try to give him as many tools as possible to make it easier on him. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220394/#Comment_220394" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T14:05:39+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  2:05PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2009 2:06PM by lachek.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Short answer: Yes, thoroughly.<br/>Longer answer: Within the procedures of play themselves. The manuscript I'm working on describes each atomic piece of the game (Characters, Basic rules, Sets, Conflicts etc) in its own short, couple-of-pages section. Each section begins with a few paragraphs of introduction of the concept, in which I present the abstract notion of the piece and cover how it is intended to work in play: what sorts of information about the fiction the player can glean from it, how it's meant to be used strategically, how you may use this piece to interact with others, and so on. I suspect that in the end I'll still have some "Lumpley Principle" articles to cover, and these will get their own sections of equal importance to the others.<br/>What I'm avoiding is talking too much about social dynamics, because in this game it'd be mostly noise. "What to do if Jane disagrees with your input" or "What to do if Bob punches you in the nose" or "Who should bring the snacks" will not be covered at all. The chapter in the 4E DMG on player types and how to cater to their needs and desires is nice for D&amp;D, with long campaigns and a large player base with disparate notions of what an RPG is, but is completely unsuitable for this game. Similarly, the bits of advice on physical game setting and snacks in IAWA is really nice and suitable for that game. <i>This</i> game simply assumes that everyone is largely on the same page, and the procedures of play does not give any wiggle room to introduce drift, house rules or free-forming to suit other or competing agendas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220400/#Comment_220400" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T14:18:27+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  2:18PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This game simply assumes that everyone is largely on the same page, and the procedures of play does not give any wiggle room to introduce drift, house rules or free-forming to suit other or competing agendas. </blockquote>\nYour game better say this, in these words, then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220458/#Comment_220458" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-23T17:28:31+00:00" title="July 23, 2009  5:28PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2009 5:28PM by lachek.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Your game better say this, in these words, then.</blockquote>\nYeah.<br/>I should also mention that the genre conventions the game is based on are very well understood, and will be further stressed in the game text and supported by the mechanics. What I mean to say that the game doesn't cover is, with everyone <i>understanding</i> those genre conventions and what the goals of the game are, what do you do if strife arises in play: for <i>this</i> game, I think that'll be almost entirely unpredictable and impossible to mitigate by a uni-directional game text. Not to say that "relationship advice" doesn't belong in other games, but I'm not interested in - and see little reason for - duplicating a course on interpersonal conflict mediation in my game text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220726/#Comment_220726" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-25T11:37:21+00:00" title="July 25, 2009 11:37AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what else?  Beginning composers (I taught some composition basics to two high-schoolers this past year, and also took a composition class that had some first-time composers in it) tend <i>not to put in dynamics, tempo, articulation, etc.</i> in their scores.  They only write the notes.  They have to be reminded, over and over again, to do so.<br/><br/>I think the analogous situation is completely true for beginning game designers as well.<br/><br/>And even more advanced designers will face complex questions surrounding these issues, as demonstrated upthread.  Sometimes you actually do need to trust your players/musicians, and give them *less* information.
