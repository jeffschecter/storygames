We also were there for 9/11, knew people who died, and helped in the clean up. So we have strong shared experiences to work from. The blackout was interesting because at the time, with communications cut off, many people were paranoid it was 9/11 part 2 although once the paranoia wore off it turned into a big party.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of the initial situation, I\u2019m thinking (and am willing to change and throw any of it out) I want to incorporate post 9/11 fear (all players are on board with this but we don\u2019t want 9/11 to have anything to do with aliens) and start the game with the blackout just happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne idea I had to twist the situation, is that the alien invasion has already happened. As part of the alien\u2019s victory, the US has surrendered several of its territories. The blackout is step one in handing over Manhattan and its people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would imagine you would see a quarantine, closing of borders, negotiations to move out certain key people and businesses, xenoforming the area, aliens moving in, and keeping everything quiet in the short term. An experience we had from the blackout which would be fun to incorporate is having the players live outside of Manhattan. So when they get stuck, they can\u2019t simply return to their apartments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere would likely be many lose ends and evidence left behind that point to what has happened. I would imagine for the aliens to have won, and for people to hand over their own, something major must have occurred and something even bigger must have happened to cover it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are used to fairly traditional games and love immersive play. But are open minded. I\u2019m not sure what system to use. Any ideas? We will likely play 3 three hour games on consecutive days.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso any ideas on how to strengthen the situation, add background details, define the aliens, and potential conflicts would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214828/#Comment_214828" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T09:55:53+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  9:55AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would it be cheesy to mimic the way europeans colonized america in the first place by signing and breaking contracts, dividing the tribes and spreading disease?<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething that is hard to justify is why aliens with star-faring technology would care about the resources of Earth.<br/>\n-Gene wealth, the aliens aren't extremely good biologists so taking genes and proteins and species to breed pays off<br/>\n-Religion, other sentients can't be trusted with holding together ecosystems<br/>\n-Their old world died<br/>\n-It's just a small number of aliens and the ship would be considered a scouting troop by their home, their tech and greed enables them to conquer earth though.

Make it impossible to anthropomorphize them - so that the aliens aren't OMG MONSTERS but rather cold, calculating and enigmatic. This way the characters are vexed by the unknown and unknowable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's been some talk about the motivations of the aliens for invasion however it might be fruitful just to leave it blank. Other mammals can't understand our motivations for cities &amp;c; and the aboriginal populations didn't really understand European motivations for conquering the New World; at least not a first contact. I feel that if motivations are unfathomable to other members of our own species and to vary similar species then I doubt that the aliens will share anything with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom Greg Stolze's Leviathan<br/>\n<br/>\n"Perhaps it\u2019s just as well that this idea never got off the ground, since it\u2019s heavily inspired by an obscure subgenius short story by Waves Forest called \u2018Bob\u2019 and the Oxygen Wars. I tried to track down the author, but had no success. (When I say, \u2018tried to track down\u2019 I mean, \u2018used my weak search skills on the weak precursors of Google and wrote a letter to an address he used back in the 1980s\u2019. I didn\u2019t hire detectives or anything.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHis story had a splendid premise, which I will now proceed to spoil: Cold germs, while unintelligent, are telepathic with one another and act collectively. One thing this vast psychic miasma wants is to wipe out oxygen on Earth. Maybe not all of it but, y\u2019know, enough. Anaerobic microbes, after all, have trouble competing with the more sophisticated nucleated cells, let alone multi-celled critters. Since cold germs are in every human, it\u2019s not hard for the pathogen gestalt to manipulate us \u2013 that\u2019s why we do patently short-sighted things like live in smoggy cities where there\u2019s less oxygen, drive cars, neglect alternative fuels\u2026 he didn\u2019t mention gas huffing or autoerotic asphyxiation specifically, but it fits the pattern."<br/>\n<br/>\nLike, that sort of weird. I'd take that, mash it up with Cloverfield and the Half-Life series. Maybe even a little of Greg Bear's Blood Music. Although I'd try to keep it really, really gritty and not pulpy at all. Have the inflection/invasion move slowly and sideways. Turn up the paranoia and survival horror to eleven.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I just thought of is tossing in aliens in ways that blindside the players. Like, I don't when there doing something normal have and alien just enter the scene doing something that's totally normal for it, with little regard for the players presence. Lay the details on thick but keep the tone casual. Running into large mammals unexpectedly is spooky enough for me, much less some extrasolar horror.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214944/#Comment_214944" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T18:27:51+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  6:27PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2009 8:58PM by Nathan_H.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the first adventure I'd have the aliens off screen.<br>Really, it's about the people.<br>If I'd do the whole weird alien thing, I'd make it some kind of immaterial presence.<br>Hearing voices, or something?<br>Aliens are just a focusing lens for whatever you want the story to be about.<br>I'd start with creating characters, then I'd think about what the aliens are like.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215152/#Comment_215152" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T15:52:55+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  3:52PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, great idea. I like the aliens having to lay low.<br/>\n<br/>\nJames, system wise I\u2019m not sure. I want to play Hot War or Cold War but I don\u2019t think I will have time to learn them before tomorrow. PTA could work! I don\u2019t own Dead of Night but would like to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m also thinking of using a variation of the [url=<a href="http://sexandbullets.com/the5/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sexandbullets.com/the5/</a><br/>\n]The 5[/url]. We\u2019re close to sending out updated playtest kits and it could be fun to see what else the system can do. Especially since it uses a Manhattan subway map which fits with the situation. The combat system focusing on the ebb and flow of who has momentum makes for great chases and suspense.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was also considering Mouse Guard but I don\u2019t know if I have the time to reskin it. But I might wake up earlier to try it. Elements of Trail of Cthulhu could also work.<br/>\n<br/>\nNathan W, I like your ideas for the aliens. Make them truly alien. I\u2019d love for some advice on how to shape that. I have a few ideas on the series of events leading to the quarantine of Manhattan and the process of xenoforming the area while testing various bio weapons and drugs on the trapped populace. But I haven\u2019t thought much about the actual aliens. But I like where you were going.<br/>\n<br/>\nNathan H, first adventure having the aliens off screen will definitely be a go! I like the idea of it being a semi immaterial presence. Maybe they take up physical space differently than we do. Maybe the communicate by rearranging their own molecules to create symbols. Could be anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe definitely need some sort of omen or sign that lingers when they are close by.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
