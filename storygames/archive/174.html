<p>I like to frame Color as the <em>essential</em> details of the setting, while System concerns the <em>substantial</em> details of the setting. The fact that lots of folks don't know the distinction between essence and substance underscores how many folks can't really separate Color and System.</p>

<p>You wanna elaborate on this?</p>

                            Man, you know what would have been cool?  If I hadn't been punted off of the forum and lost my response to your question.  Let's try that again:<br/><br/><b>essence</b> - <em>n</em> The intrinsic or indispensable properties that serve to characterize or identify something.<br/><b>substance</b> - <em>n</em> That which is solid and practical in character, quality, or importance<br/>-- American Heritage Dictionary, Fourth Edition<br/><br/>Admittedly, the AHD witlessly defines substance as essence (but not vice-versa).  Someday I'll subscribe to the OED and get some decent definitions.<br/><br/>In any case, you can think of essence as the character of a thing, and substance as the stuff that it's made out of.  The essence of <em>Exalted</em> is badassery; the substance is giant swords and magic charms.  The essence of <em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> is tough moral choices; the substance is towns, coats, and guns.<br/><br/>I define Color as essential details because they're the things that are really important -- they're the feel, the heat, the juicy goodness.  System I define as the substantial details because they're what communicate that essence -- they're the vehicle, the conduit, the expression.<br/><br/>It's why you don't need mechanics for essence (and probably, in fact, shouldn't) but you do for substance -- it is the purpose of substance to do the heavy lifting that expresses the essence.                        </div>

                            Ufff! Essence and Substance. Hard for me to get the subtle difference. In Spanish the meaning of these terms are almost perfectly the same. But I think I get the point.<br/><br/>Color and System are a basic and not modificable foundation of a game. <br/><br/>Color, once stablished, is a reference framework for the creativity work of the players. If it changes substantially during play the common understanding of how is the shared-imagined-space may be broken. <br/><br/>System, of course, defines how the game delivers the playing experience. If you change some part of the system, the game slightly changes, and it is a different one.                        </div>

<p>Whenever I see statements like this, I wonder.</p>
<p>I had a longer statement prepared, but by my reading, it seems that you're talking in two directions - the system is the conduit for color, so it necessarily constrains it. Yet you say that we don't need mechanics for Color~essence. That seems to be a contradiction to me; since it must be mechanised at the interface between C and S, the influence of S will bleed into C and colour your interpretation of it.</p>

                            Oh, certainly the System can "color" the Color.  The best example is probably Burning Wheel, built on Luke's axiom "system is setting."<br/>
<br/>
But consider the difference between these two:<br/>
"Orcs are a strong and brutish race living in the Verran Wastes."<br/>
"Orcs receive a +1 to their Strength score, a -1 to their Civilized score, and automatically receive the skill Area Knowledge: Verran Wastes for free."<br/>
<br/>
Which one is going to work more efficiently at making orcs work the way the designer expects them to?                        </div>

I think this is one of those questions to which the answer can only be, "It depends on the people. There is no True Way to perceive or identify differences of the sort being talked about here - there's only what people do." Hegel's dead, I hear. :)                        </div>
