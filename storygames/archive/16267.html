On the other hand, the convention impact of the OSR has been disappointing in terms of sales, interest and brand recognition, again in comparison to the Forge-related indie movement. (My conclusion regarding the first point is from off-hand mentions about sales figures that people drop from time to time in the 'net and private conversations; on the latter I'm basing my impression on my own experiences selling both Forge and OSR products at various Finnish, British and German conventions last year.)<br/><br/>The publishing schedules of the OSR movement in total are comparable with the same numbers from the Forge movement (I'll just use that term, you know what I mean), but most of the OSR publishing is in direct support of old school D&amp;D, while the Forge publishing is mostly narrow independent games. OSR authors tend to publish more as PDF-only products, thought, which might push them ahead on total number of publication. (I don't have a strong sense of this, as my attention tends to focus on the print product due to my retail hobby.)<br/><br/>The lesson I take away here is that there probably are slightly more OSR-interested gamers in total than Forge-interested ones, but the latter are much, much more active in the Internet and gaming culture (convention circuit, etc.). Also, the OSR entry points and sales hooks are not nearly as compelling as the Forge equivalents, and it is usually much more feasible to sell an indifferent gamer, a curious gamer or a complete newbie on a selected Forge game than a selected OSR product. Overall it seems to me that OSR people hang around in their own circles and don't interact much with the mainstream of roleplaying, while Forge people tend to have more to do and more to discuss and more to offer to the average gamer. This would, if correct, be easily explained by the idea that the Forge is about designing and playing new and better games, while the OSR is about improving and exploring on a single game; the latter message seems like it would match better with a quiet home life, while the former goes naturally with convention outreach, cycling gaming groups and such.<br/><br/>To illustrate this perspective with an OSR author near and dear, I often joke that Jim Raggi has 300 fans in the American Midwest, so anything he publishes will get 300 sales pretty much right away and automatically. That's the sort of loyal core your average indie author dreams about - when you count in the periphery, Jim sells in numbers comparable to the upper 10% of the Forge scene. His numbers are not exceptional in the OSR scene, I understand, which to me indicates that there is a serious support base of active players and customers out there, even if it seems in European conventions that about one in a thousand visitors has even heard about the OSR. Either all these OSR gamers are in e.g. America where I don't see them, or they're more prone to staying at home. Be that as it may, they clearly exist on the basis of the sales numbers.<br/><br/>(I touch upon a completely possible explanation to my observations above: if Americans come in and tell us that yeah, they see OSR gamers running underfoot all the time on a continent-wide scale, then that'll explain the discrepancy between sales numbers and convention impact quite neatly. If the OSR is a heavily USA-centric phenomenon, then of course it'd seem under-represented in Europe in comparison to global sales numbers. If this is the case, then we might expect things to even out within five years or so: American rpg trends tend to move to the old world sooner or later, so it stands to reason that we'd see the OSR grow even more from its current numbers when Europeans get into it to similar degrees we see with the Forge movement right now.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Have you had direct experiences with this "movement" changing things in your role-playing community? If so; could you tell us how OSR affected the gaming-culture there?</blockquote>\nWell, we all play OSR D&amp;D right now, and have been doing that for a year almost exclusively. That's a pretty drastic change in terms of style of play and goals of play and so on. Of course it's just a different game, so I don't know if there are going to be any long-term permanent changes that transfer from game to game. The fact that we play old school D&amp;D is itself a change caused by the OSR movement, though; I doubt that I'd be running the game were it not for the inspirational and useful writing people have been doing about it in the Internet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_371282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371282/#Comment_371282" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T18:08:03+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  6:08PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really appreciate your post, Eero. Thanks!<br/><br/>Seems to me like the old rpg-groups are rolling along in their old games, as always, but with the added facet that some of them (a minority?) now exchange views on game-mastering on a more regular and formal level.<br/><br/>Could it be that the net is the main reason this "movement" is happening now? As in; these are isolated groups which have been campaigning their old games for decades, and now the leaders of these groups are brought together by the net? As they are brought together a dogma is developed, to make it easier for them to discuss their game-play?<br/><br/>And could this be a "parallel evolution" of role-playing games? As in; these groups being so isolated, and possibly so estranged by the developments that have taken place outside their isolated groups the last decades, that they are kind of evolving into the Australia of the rpg-world?

RPGs stayed pretty close to the original formula of character stats, damage ratings, combat rules for the first 30 years (even ground breaking games like Toon or Vampire still look familiar to original D&amp;D).  It's no surprise that when game design breaks out of that mold, there's a sizeable chunk, a majority likely, that doesn't want to go with it.<br/><br/>So the main effect to gaming culture is like any other social advance. People generally don't like change, and will find reasons to resist it.  I think that's a side of a culture war that I'm less interested in. Play what you like. But at the same time, evaluate what you play and challenge the idea that this is the best there is just because you like it. Most often reasons end up being based more on happenstance of what surrounds you.<br/><br/>The interesting part of old school exploration is the design oriented investigation. What was fun? Why did other things stick around? What was the value in these designs? How much of it is a product of its time, and how much was brilliant and useful? What can we learn from old school games?<br/><br/>I am still getting used to the term "OSR" so I haven't seen or felt much effects, other than Dungeon World being very popular around here.  But those are the questions I'm interested in. Those are the reasons I keep looking into old school topics, even though I'm pretty confident that I never want to play an edition of D&amp;D published in the 20th century again. There's still value in those games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_371288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371288/#Comment_371288" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T18:24:32+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  6:24PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please correct me if I'm wrong here; aren't Dungeon World a so-called "indie-game"?

I wouldn't even use it, I only discuss "OSR" and "old school D&amp;D" specifically because "old school roleplaying" is too generic and vague. I mean, the 'net is full of people who consider entirely ordinary traditional games "old school", using the term to indicate the design trend started in the early '80s and continuing unbroken until today. In this kind of discourse environment calling Dungeon World "old school" makes perfect sense. Others use "old school" but limit it to a range of games from the '70s, pointing out some design features common to them; this perhaps makes better sense, but I'm not comfortable and familiar enough with the game texts and their cultural context to really comment on anything outside D&amp;D and say Tunnels &amp; Trolls - the games I've actually played myself, basically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371298/#Comment_371298" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T18:40:03+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  6:40PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/><br/>- Have you had direct experiences with this "movement" changing things in your role-playing community?

Speaking as co-designer of Dungeon World, I thought I'd throw in my two cents on the whole DW-as-OSR bit.  <br/><br/>We're not, really, by most definitions of the term, an "OSR" game.  Mechanically, Dungeon World is very much an "indie" game with all the rules and what have you that go along with that.  What we are, though, is heavily inspired by OSR-style storytelling.  What DW does is marries the kinds of narratives (explore the dungeon, have wacky adventures, fight monsters, get killed by orcs, etc etc) that D&amp;D tells with current-gen rules design.<br/><br/>So, I mean, I wouldn't advertise DW as an OSR game, but I'd definitely say it tells the same kinds of stories.  If you want THAC0 and turn-based dungeon exploring and that, you won't find it in our game but if you play a session with Moldvay and you play a session with us, you'll end up telling the same stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371309/#Comment_371309" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T19:23:05+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  7:23PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting take, Adam, because my sense of the OSR and Basic is that they are aggressively "anti-story," in that narrative considerations are explicitly not at all what the game is about. Instead, you follow the mechanics and sometimes an interesting story emerges, but mostly not. Like, what happens is still interesting, but it doesn't follow any recognizable story logic. Characters die randomly. Threads of inquiry lead to nothing. You might spend a long time heading in one direction to have it lead to a dead end. Any sense of drama is secondary to the aggressive "play to find out what happens" style of play, much more so than in AW and DW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371311/#Comment_371311" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T19:31:54+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  7:31PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonthan,<br/><br/>Totally.

The OSR is a hand-loaded bullet straight at the heart of that demographic, bringing them exactly what they played in their glory days in an updated format and enormously accessible form. When the hobby was young, this exact product shook the pillars of marketing heaven.

And I don't understand where those people are getting that image from. Like maybe I have not dug deeply into the belly of OSR and found these rumoured basement beasts, but if you have to really dig to find them, then who gives a shit?<br><br>It seems like people are have way too much excitement playing us vs them, to bother attempting to connect with anyone. ANd any interactions people have, they seem to be  determined to make it  into a shit fight so they can go "haha those guys! those are dicks!"<br/><br/>Like I kinda fell into in the osr, I had not played rpgs in like 10 years , and I had/have been doing a project where I make every monster in the monster manual out of scrap fabric (because it was winter and did not feel like leaving the house), and I started getting linked by peoples blogs, I started reading said blogs, and realized that there was all these people actually being interesting with games. And I started playing again and writing various bat shit ideas about stuff, and people responded favourably and so I kept doing it.<br/><br/>ANd my blog gets included under the osr umbrella, which is fine, because there's great people there, ideas that I want to immediately use , and people paying attention to me. Which is a dangerous combination..<br/>Am I osr?<br/>I, as a gamer, have never meet a system I did not immediately start to hack, even before I finished reading the thing. I could not give a flying fuck how it used to be played in the day, and will ruthless vandalise any fantasy traditions in my way.<br/>ANd I have never felt looked down upon or snubbed for not fitting into some gary cult of gary in the osr.<br/>I don't understand where this perception is coming from. <br/><br/>There is numerous blogs in the OSR where people harp on about racial limits or old school saving throws and how the love them. Stuff I jettisoned in a heart beat. But.. so? Like if a blog is talking about a style of gaming I'm not wanting to play and there's nothing else there for me, I don't read it and there's no problem, because either way it has not an iota of effect on my life.<br/><br/>The only homogeneous traits I can see in the OSR is people know what they like and get rid of any bullshit in the way of that. For some people that's playing straight out of the box back in day system, racial level limits and all. Other people some mash up of pathfinder and older systems.<br/>The other trait would be a focus on player agency and emergent "story" , like it's a game first and becomes a story second. Because that's funner for some people than having a gripping narrative, or preinvested character development.<br/><br/>I'm on this site here, because "story games" is doing a whole bunch of stuff with games I do not understand but am curious about.<br/><br/>And also I do not understand why there has to be dull arse tilting at windmills monkey shit fighting between these perceived "sides".<br/><br/>Neither "story games" nor "osr" are cohesive groups, but people are getting all jump up and downy about having teams and painting the other guy with sweeping generalizations and why? <br/><br/>Like yeah I'm sure people say dumb shit about your style of fun, but ignore them and talk to someone else.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_371344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371344/#Comment_371344" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T02:52:10+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  2:52AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Princess!

In the 1980's Rolemaster gave DnD a run for its money.  ICE took up at least as much floor space at GenCon as TSR.  In the 90's, White Wolf made serious inroads by bringing in a whole new subgroup to RPGs, and in the 90's TSR was about to go bankrupt.  In the 2000's everyone did d20, so there's no real comparison to make since everyone was using the same system.  And now, in the 2010's Pathfinder has chewed some serious hide out of DnD.  Enough hide, in fact, that WotC has had to reboot 4e once already (Essentials) and is now tossing it out the window altogether.  So DnD has always had strong competition, it's just that it outlasted them all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scrapprincess" title="scrapprincess"><img alt="scrapprincess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scrapprincess">scrapprincess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371372/#Comment_371372" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T07:07:03+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  7:07AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/tomasHVM">@tomasHVM</a><br/>ah yeah cool, sorry my post was hella off topic now that I reflect on it.

That asked tabletop RPG player what games they played monthly, where multiple choices were allowed. The answers were: <br/><br/>66%  Dungeons &amp; Dragons (WotC/TSR)<br/>25%  Vampire: The Masquerade (White Wolf)<br/>21%  Star Wars (West End Games)<br/>16%  Palladium (Palladium Books)<br/>15%  Werewolf: The Apocalypse (White Wolf)<br/>15%  Shadowrun (FASA)<br/>12%  Star Trek (Last Unicorn Games)<br/>8%  Call of Cthulhu (Chaosium)<br/>8%  Legend of the Five Rings (Alderac)<br/>5%  Deadlands (Pinnacle)<br/>4%  Alternity (WotC/TSR)<br/>3%  GURPS (SJG)<br/><br/>Admittedly, 1999 was probably a low point for D&amp;D, but the percentages for people playing other games is substantial.  The other games listed add up to 132%, so a significant fraction of people were playing more than one type of game monthly.  It's not clear what percentage of those were D&amp;D players, but it seems likely that many of them were.  <br/><br/>Short version: Possibly a majority of players play only D&amp;D, but not a vast majority.  And particularly at this point, it seems clear that they are not all playing the current edition.  <br/><br/>More on OSR in a bit...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371464/#Comment_371464" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T13:11:05+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  1:11PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Please correct me if I'm wrong here; aren't Dungeon World a so-called "indie-game"?

That makes it antithesis to "old skool" to me, as it is a part of<i>the new developments</i>in classical design. What do you think?</blockquote>\nThat's what OSR is to me, but before this week I didn't know what O.S.R stood for. I just thought there were some people who liked old school gaming and wanted to bring elements of it back. They've been around for as long as I've been gaming. I started in the 80s, and there were already people who didn't like "Advanced" D&amp;D and others who weren't going to get the 2nd edition of it. Later it was nostalgia for random tables and character generation and weapons list (some of which appears in games like White Wolf games, where it didn't seem to belong at all). More recently it's been nostalgia for mapping dungeons and searching rooms, the risk of character life and death on a die roll, and the simple rules from the early D&amp;D editions.<br/><br/>Old School Revival can mean a variety of things. At local indie cons, Dungeon World is relatively popular. At local large cons D&amp;D (3.x mostly including pathfinder) Hero and Call of Cthulhu completely dominate.  I don't think there's really a "revival" to it except in the indie circles. For a majority of players, they never stopped playing old school games. Most of the largest RP game companies cater to them. WotC, Paizo, White Wolf, SJG, Fantasy Flight, and Hero Games to name a few. <br/><br/>But OSR as in playing games from the 70's?  I only see activity on that online. I know only a few people in my personal sphere who have said they would want to do that. I know fewer who have tried it. And I don't know anyone who enjoyed the experience.<br/><br/>I don't know if Dungeon World fits in it or not, but given there's no official definition, it fits it for me even if one of the co-creators states that it wasn't intentional. All I know is that, despite a great GM and fellow players, I didn't enjoy Dungeon World. And the stuff I didn't enjoy were things like equipment purchasing, inventory management, special ability tracking, and keeping an eye on gaining XP to level up. All things that were added to Apocalypse World that were familiar elements of my first time playing D&amp;D. Maybe they stood out because they were incongruous to the ultimately "indie" RPG. <br/><br/>But that's what revivals are. Every revival in history is a mix of looking back, nostalgia, and attempts at reincorporation. Most often, they don't go anywhere. Sometimes they synthesize and produce some breakout moments where an art form is carried forward from the introspection. It's only when enough of those happen do you get a revival that shows an impact.  Games like DW (classic dungeon delving) and Icons (random character creation) are the biggest examples I can think of on the impact of Old School design revisiting. Though it's very likely that D&amp;D 5 will have some elements, too, but we'll have to see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371483/#Comment_371483" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T15:16:00+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  3:16PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My tiny bit of anecdotal evidence for OSR influence.<br/><br/>Because I've seen a lot of talk about some of the great things to be found in old D&amp;D stuff, I ended up reading through some early modules. Found some stuff I thought was really neat in them.<br/><br/>So I patchworked several of them together into a semi-cohesive sandboxy sort of setting and GMed a group of friends around it for most of a year.<br/><br/>Didn't use any flavors of D&amp;D for it. Wasn't interested enough in that at the time. (Used a slightly hacked version of Savage Worlds instead). If I was starting over, I would probably go back and look through some of the early text exploration techniques/mechanics/whatever (or the recently revised versions thereof). And I'd probably hack them a bit to take out the parts that bug me.<br/><br/>So, personally, I was influenced by the "movement", because it pointed me in some directions I wouldn't have otherwise explored. But I wouldn't categorize the stuff that happened at my table to have been a part of the movement.<br/><br/>When I read things like Luke Crane's account of how old skool mapping techniques led (after significant effort) to some really fun emergent behavior at the table, I can see the potential for value in things that I otherwise would have been likely to dismiss out of hand. When that happens, it's pretty awesome.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I can't imagine using the old texts 100% as written. Some elements of it absolutely boggle my mind. Like the economies - the value of common goods compared to the kinds of treasures being hauled out of dungeons. That's an element I totally redid for what I ran - I used the stated treasures as inspiration and totally reworked what I actually made available (partly because I wanted to keep the party poor and motivated by cash).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/untimately" title="untimately"><img alt="untimately" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/085/n2DMX2JRS72SF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/untimately">untimately</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371865/#Comment_371865" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-08T21:38:22+00:00" title="April  8, 2012  9:38PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2012 9:39PM by untimately.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>the OSR firmly rejects Pathfinder - a Spot check instead of telling the GM exactly where you look is anathema</blockquote>\nIt's true that many OSR types (myself included) are quite critical of skill systems, but that doesn't mean that they are anathema.

Some equals it to old games, some to original D&amp;D, some make it a dogmatic list of game-elements, and some says it consist of all people acknowledging the original qualities of classical role-playing games. I do not believe we need to reach any agreement in such questions. Let it be whatever it is to the people who cares about it.<br/><br/>I believe this thread has served its purpose. Reading it I glean the extent of OSR-activity/beliefs in our culture (small to moderate), and how it has influenced play-practise (by giving renewed and well-deserved focus on certain qualities in classical rpgs).<br/><br/>For my own I do not feel any need to "convert" to OSR, or to study it further. I do not feel that the "old school" has anything to offer me personally. What this "school" focus on, I have discussed, studied and designed on continually since the eighties. I do all my role-playing design, both classical and modern, with the best of my players at hart, and with the intent to sharpen my methods by any means available. Even for classical role-playing games (those with GM+players), there is only one way forward; through continual development.<br/><br/>Others may have need for a philosophical system like the "old skool" on their classical gaming, both as leaders and designers. If they do, I hope they are wise enough to adopt this thinking without the countercultural attitudes. There is no need to practice "old skool" as a kind of <i>protest</i> against new games or play-styles (classical or modern). Practice it as a positive way to define your particular gaming.<br/><br/>Thank you for contributing to this discussion, and for reading it!

AD&amp;D had proficiency rules, and in basic D&amp;D we'd do stat checks. And every since the beginning there were rules for finding secret doors and traps. You just have to say exactly where you are looking and THEN make the "spot" check.<br/><br/>Maybe JD was referring to the wording in the official Old School Revival Council constitutional charter, which like many institutions, makes broad blanket statements to establish intent, but doesn't capture the preferences of the masses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
