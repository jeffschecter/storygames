He's also done a tiny bit of roleplaying when <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11218" rel="nofollow">we played <i>Wushu</i> a couple of years ago</a>.  But even when we did the <i>Wushu</i> thing, I ended up having to simplify the rules even more than they already were just so he could grasp the mechanics.  He's autistic, and even though he's older now than he was the last time we played, he still has issues with complexity.<br/><br/>I'd love to do some <i>Doctor Who</i> roleplay with him \u2014 suggestions for straightforward scenarios he could work through are appreciated, so drop them here if you have any, because I'm not as well-versed in <i>Doctor Who</i> lore as he \u2014 but something like the Cubicle 7 <i>Doctor Who</i> game is way, way too much for him to handle.  Does anyone have an idea about an uncomplicated resolution system that doesn't just boil down to "let him do whatever he wants"?  I was thinking some variation on <i>Apocalypse World</i>'s "roll two dice, 10+ is a flat-out success, slightly lower has complications, etc." might work, but I'm not a game designer by any stretch of the imagination and I don't know if that mechanic can be bettered.<br/><br/>Thoughts?

If that makes sense.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to the stones: is there a point where there are a maximum number of stones on the table, where the Doctor fails to resolve the situation, or should we remove a failure option entirely from play to discourage a negative experience?

Alas most of the established Doctor Who games out there are complex.  The simplest version I ever played used the character sheets and skills from FASA's Doctor Who but the resolution matrix was tossed out of the window (as well it should have been) in favor of a target number which you tried to roll under on 2d6.<br/><br/>As for adventure ideas, there is a Doctor Who Oracle on Abulafia <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Doctor_Who_Oracle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Doctor_Who_Oracle</a>. It might help spark some ideas.  Most Doctor Who adventures boil down to alien menace threatens Earthlings, often due to stupid things the Earthlings have done, Doctor swoops in and saves them, often from themselves.  I could whip together some more specific plots if you like.  Does he enjoy the history side of things or is he more in it for fighting aliens regardless of the backdrop?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360746/#Comment_360746" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T08:52:51+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  8:52AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RichD, my son mostly likes the exploration/problem solving elements because they are very concrete things he can understand.  For example, there's an episode \u2014 I can't remember which one, because I don't really watch the show that much \u2014 with really involved elevators that decontaminate the riders and he was completely fascinated by that.  Weird, world-building things attract his attention, like the watchful heads in "The Beast Below" that change expression based on a person's behavior.  So even more than "fight the aliens," he likes the Doctor's discovery of new and interesting setting elements which, while relatively simple in concept, works out to be fairly difficult in practice, especially if you're not the sort who comes up with stuff like this regularly.  Which I am not.  I write crime novels, not semi-fanciful science-fiction.<br/><br/>Using the session of <i>Wushu</i> that we played as a model, I figure a successful <i>Doctor Who</i> game will involve the introduction of two to three novel setting elements that trip his particular triggers (elevators/mechanical stuff, computers, funny aliens) and then maybe a couple of problems to solve.  He's not really ready for something that'll take hours and hours to complete, so figure 90 minutes on the outside?<br/><br/>I know this is a tall order, which is why I'm crowdsourcing the design process.  Making up games for kids is hard.  Making up a game for a kid who doesn't think like other kids is an order of magnitude more difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360747/#Comment_360747" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T08:54:16+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  8:54AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>A losing scenario didn't seem appropriate for the theme, but I did think of an upper limit endgame trigger.

He makes things happen the way the Doctor would.<br/><br/>You play everyone else and your job is to provide a steady stream of challenges to him. <br/><br/><br/>You start the game describing a scenario. You could even use the intro to a real Doctor Who episode. That is where the game starts. You say "And now the story goes off in a different direction..."<br/><br/>You make up an event that happens next. Something interesting but not too strong a move. Think about what you could say happened in a paragraph.<br/><br/>Then say "What happens next Doctor?'<br/><br/>He makes up something, then you make up something, etc.<br/><br/>Pretty early in the game jump in and challenge something he says. You say what happens instead. Both of you roll 2d6, the high roller wins, re-roll ties.<br/><br/>Walk your way through the story and of course make certain that the Doctor wins. Your son will be practicing a lot of creativity and quick thinking with rules that almost don't exist.<br/><br/>The written rules look something like this.<br/><br/>1. Every player decides up front whither they want things to work or fall apart. <br/>2. Play goes around the table. Each player in turn says what happens next.<br/>3. Players may jump in and challenge any action if they say what happens instead. The high roller wins.<br/>4.

However, this sweet sounding utopia is fueled by an underclass forced into sweatshop factories to produce noise that is the raw power.  This system is enforced by crystalline robots that tinkle like wind-chimes when happy but shriek like banshees against undesirable elements.

I definitely think he would go for situations where he would have to fix and/or change things using his sonic screwdriver so he could act it out.  I may encourage him to bring his sonic screwdriver with him this weekend and, if circumstances permit, do some simple roleplay \u2014 just scenes, really, nothing involved \u2014 so he can do what he sees other people doing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361139/#Comment_361139" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T11:57:45+00:00" title="February 21, 2012 11:57AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and he also likes Daleks.

Well check this one out: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_elevator</a>.<br/><br/>The Doctor arrives on Earth in the year 2250.  The TARDIS has parked itself in a warehouse in the middle of the military base that houses the Space Elevator Control Center or as it is nicknamed, The Ground Floor.   The Doctor is swiftly detained by authorities but some fast talk or psychic paper should get him on the side of the military.  The elevator is not yet complete but is built enough that supplies and personnel can ascend via the elevator instead of by rocket.  The base has been experiencing some troubling power fluctuations over the last few days.  What they don't know is that energy based aliens trapped within the Earth's Van Allen Belt have tapped into the elevator's systems and are turning it into a massive aerial so that an invasion force can descend via the elevator cable and bypass the Van Allen radiation belt that has stopped all previous attempts at invasion.  For added tension, the TARDIS was loaded onto the last shipment sent up to the satellite tethering the space elevator so the Doctor will either have to risk a trip up the cable or cobble together a rocket from the abandoned shuttles disused since the elevator could carry up its own cargo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361161/#Comment_361161" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T12:58:38+00:00" title="February 21, 2012 12:58PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nifty!
