If you ever played the earlier d100-based RuneQuest system (called "Basic"), you have an idea for how the action is resolved. The genius of BareBones comes from the way that percentile-rolling is applied to everything, and from the way that character "classes" in the traditional RPG sense are re-cast as skills that can be developed at different paces. The result is a very simple-to-learn and organic system that encourages character development over class min-maxing (though that is still possible).<br/><br/>Like the skills, the number of total spells described in the core rulebook is short but the applications of the spells are broad. Again, this favors narrative and creative use but isn't so lose that powers are not well balanced. The combat mechanics are very flexible, and introduce some brilliant tactical options, but the combat is not locked into a particular style of grid or hex map.<br/><br/>The system comes with a module for entry-level characters; I ran it for my regular gaming group and we'll definitely be putting together a longer campaign.<br/><br/>Anyhow, definitely worth a look!<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Grmbrand                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397720/#Comment_397720" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-16T07:58:46+00:00" title="November 16, 2012  7:58AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like it might be interesting.

I've also run the BareBones Fantasy "intro" module that comes with the system and really, it is hard to make comparisons.<br/><br/>The retro-systems are fun, IMHO, because they are retro. They aren't necessarily logical in how their rules are set up. They tend to be delightfully brutal to player characters, which is definitely in the old-school spirit.<br/><br/>By contrast, I think that BareBones Fantasy is really balanced for long-term narrative-style. Just the fact that classes are expressed as percentages rather than (or really, in addition to) hard levels makes for a lot of interesting possibilities. Also, ditching <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic" rel="nofollow">Vancian magic</a> is a welcome change.<br/><br/>My gaming crew had no trouble picking this system up, but they're all long-time gamers. I'm going to try it with my kids, next and see what they think. Anyhow, definitely worth looking at!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
