How many sessions did it run? What are the highest level characters you've played, and how did that work out? If you've GMed high level games, was there anything different about running it?

Everyone was around fifth level when we stopped, and It got pretty crazy. My brief observation was that higher level characters become really powerful, and the ability to chain moves combined with lots of hit points is a very potent combination. At the time I expressed some concern that the system might start to get a little shaky at high levels and I'm curious about other people's experiences as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360011/#Comment_360011" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T11:42:15+00:00" title="February 16, 2012 11:42AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have any data yet, but I'm also super interested in this, since I'm starting a Planarch campaign soon and I'm not sure that plane-jumping characters start at first level (maybe they do, maybe not).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360013/#Comment_360013" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T11:48:02+00:00" title="February 16, 2012 11:48AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, how did playtesting the high levels go, Sage &amp; Adam?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360026/#Comment_360026" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T12:57:33+00:00" title="February 16, 2012 12:57PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience has been that high levels feel remarkably like low levels, actually. Ignoring any crazy math we haven't caught yet (possible, but I hope we caught it all) things move much the same.<br/><br/>There's kind of two aspects: how do the rules scale and how does the fiction scale.<br/><br/>The rules, at least in my testing, don't change too much in feel. High level characters have more options, and are maybe more focused in an area, but they don't get the same kind of adventure-bypassing abilities that d20 has. Fights are still dangerous, unknown areas still require exploring, treasure is still worth having. Not much changes, though going straight to high level can be strange: having that many new abilities is a lot to manage. If you've grown to that point it's less of a burden, but still something we're keeping an eye on. (I actually just emailed Adam with an idea about that, stay tuned.)<br/><br/>The fiction scales differently since, like AW, you accumulate interesting stuff and it builds. Your fronts, campaign and dungeon/adventure, build to a head. It changes the tone of the game somewhat from "Hey, we're just going to swing into this dungeon for a bit" to a bigger picture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360088/#Comment_360088" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-16T20:47:47+00:00" title="February 16, 2012  8:47PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My one (reasonably long term group) is up to 'expert' levels. The thief at 6 the wizard at 8. As Sage says, the most obvious scaling is in the fiction. It is far more burning wheel style chasing goals type stuff in the broader world now. All cities in peril and Kingdom shattering arcane wars and machinations of Elder Dragons....I experiemented with 'prestige moves' a bit, but the players seem to like the various iterations of their basic and playbook moves, simply extrapolated to their now ledgendary status. We have experimented (pun hugely intended) with various systems, and actually like the new iteration the best (with level up at 7+level), closely followed by the BBC key system.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 'meta game' that comes from chaining moves is oh so exciting in the fiction, as it needs the situational context to even be authored, let alone work. But when it does its EPIC and memorable and truely allows me to be fans of the characters as I provide them with just the right level of hard move in return.. Tonks the Wizard is a burgeoning master of his craft now that he has level 7 spells (and lots of them). His spellbook is rather precious! Brancino the thief is well on his way to evil assassin-dom, which he has aspired to since our first session almost a year ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360258/#Comment_360258" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-17T12:54:07+00:00" title="February 17, 2012 12:54PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Noofy</cite><br/>The 'meta game' that comes from chaining moves is oh so exciting in the fiction, as it needs the situational context to even be authored, let alone work.

These two misfits are my camping buddies characters: Tonks the the human wizard and Brancino, the halfling thief come wannabe assassin. They have become somewhat of a celebrity duo in their hometown of Dingledale, having cheesy ballads sung about them in bawdy houses and a string of swooning sellswords clamouring for their patronage at any public appearance.  After a few forays into Phoniex mountain uncovering its secrets, the two have come up with a 'system' they formulated to scout out its depths. <br/>\n<br/>\nTonks the wizard has the advances 'logical', 'ethereal tether', an INT of 18 and the spell 'greater invisibility'. He has created a tether with the willing subject of his fellow adventurer Brancino. They hit apon the clever trick (after tonks was injured and needed to stay put in an ancient dweomer library) of casting greater invisibility on Brancino - which on a 7-9 exposed Tonks to danger - and I revealed the impending doom of:  yes indeed, Zargoz, the grand master theurge of the lofty peaks was on his way to find them, entourage of beasties in tow. So whilst Tonks curled into a corner of the library nursing his wounds, the invisible Brancino slunk off towards Zargoz's lair. This effectively seperates them, which I like and allows us some rather funny roleplay banter via the tether! After avoiding a fair swathe of vicious monsters, he arrived, finding the well appointed chambers empty. But they needed leverage on Zargoz to thwart his nefarious plans to rule Dingledale with an iron fist. Brancino is dumb and no where near as crafty as he thinks he is, so Tonks discerns realities on the chamber through Brancino using their tether, and allows his logical mind to deduct the best leverage possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately he only manages a 7-9 and I say that he can hear the approaching drum of footsteps as the Archmage and his minions draw ever closer. Branciono as the host I grant one question from discern realities as he looks for leverage (what here is important to me?) and he manages to author (as I turn the question back on him) that Zargoz has love letters cast nonchalantly across his skeletal framed bed. They are from a tiefling prostitute named Gizelda working off a debt to a high ranking death priest  back in Dingledale. Score!  Meanwhile Tonks is nigh on being discovered and subsequently dismembered; cowering in the magical stacks of the ancient library, waiting for the evil portents of a half dozen nasty arcane big bads to coming crashing down on his measly frame. It is at this point that Brancino comes up with some DW gold. He asks that surely the tether would work both ways? And asks that Tonks allows him into his mind, so that he may use his 'escape route' move through Tonks' perceptions. Who am I to say no to tis awesomeness?!! Hell YES! Brancino manages a weak hit so I say that sure, Tonksey (under Brancino's suggestion!)  finds an old sewerage duct that he can just squeeze through and avoid detection, but only if he leaves behind his now rather large spellbook!<br/>\n<br/>\nIts an agonising decision, and the duo rendezvous at the foot of Phoenix mountain, Tonks covered in shit, sans spellbook, but Brancino clutching a sheave of hard hitting love-letters that determine the whereabouts of their leverage. It was one of the best roleplay sessions of my life, and around a campfire to boot!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360396/#Comment_360396" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-18T06:51:27+00:00" title="February 18, 2012  6:51AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that Noofy, it's really great to hear!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360455/#Comment_360455" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-18T17:48:50+00:00" title="February 18, 2012  5:48PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No worries!

Its just that we play once every few months as campfire entertainment whilst we are camping and so I invariably never take notes and we tend to ad-hoc our alcohol addled memories of the past sessions events.
