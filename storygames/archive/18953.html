I've been incorporating live music to RPG sessions for some time now. As far as I know nobody else does it and it is very experimental (with emphasis on mental). Essentially the concept is: the addition of an improvising musician to the GM+players system. Maybe it sounds incredibly posh, I don't know. But I've been having fun as the musician... I've never been that much interested in individual characters, but rather in atmosphere, for which music is an excellent tool. I have used either a clavichord or a synth keyboard.<br/><br/>Before each game, I and the GM agree upon what kind of appropriate musical style I will prepare, and I use tools provided by that style, to accompany the courses and turns of the story and dialogue, amplifying their emotional impact. In practice this means that whatever people describe verbally, I describe musically. As a spiritual backdrop I have baroque opera with its recitative and aria; I'm told that the genre of musical is not completely unlike it. On-site response has been enthusiastic. Of course, this does not mean that there aren't any problems. There are constraints on what kind of verbal communication I'm able to follow:<br/><br/>1) I can't really play anything to dice-rolling, rule talk or tactical/positioning negotiations. Naturally, this rules traditional adventure RPGs as rather unsuitable. <br/>2) I can't play anything sensible if the characters' lines are short, consecutive, even overlapping bursts. This is especially the problem with ad-hoc player groups where the players' struggle for power over the story can be a detriment to actual storytelling. <br/>3) Off-character talk and violating the IC/OOC border in general are very counter-productive.<br/><br/>I like to impose these limitations to the rest of the group:<br/><br/>1) As a rule of thumb, make sufficiently long and meaningful lines I can take hold of, eg. 1-2 sentences. <br/>2) No off-character talk. We make frequent 5-minute intermissions to catch up and ask and make plans. And I want to cool off my fingers from time to time. <br/>3) Don't talk over each other! I had success with playing a sign, eg. a clear V-I cadence, once a player has finished, to signal that another player (or the GM) can take the scene.<br/><br/>Other problems, inexhaustively:<br/><br/>1) An atmosphere game works best from my point of view, however, according to my GM of trust, it can be very straightforward and not entirely gratifying for him.<br/>2) Not everybody knows a willing musician...<br/><br/>So far we have played ia.: 17th century horror with baroque music; Metro 2033-style apocalypse with doom ambient; space exploration with sci-fi film music pastiches... We have used the Flow system, which has served passably (perhaps just because there are no dice). However, a helpful soul very recently pointed out that there are potential benefits of creating mechanical rules for using music in a game, and that the 'story games movement' could be in the power to provide a good model or platform. For example, players could form a first-in first-out queue to take turns in storytelling and I could better anticipate what to play. I should look for a system that is more drama- and aesthetic-oriented than Flow, he said.<br/><br/>I'm not at all familiar with story games, which is why I'm here now. If anybody else has any similar experiences, I'm all ears... but I'm equally happy to be the one and only. <br/><br/>My question is in the subject line. Hopefully I didn't forget anything important.

You're trying to act as a mood amplifier for others, not to affect the conversation with an agency of your own. You define yourself as part of the GM's toolbox, not as a player.<br/>I will resist going into the whys of the above, but I can't help noticing you're experiencing issues with it. Most notably, your task being a 2-step process (get input from players, send it back to them woven into music) it's slow, and many of the problems you highlight probably stem from this rather simple issue of time logistics.<br/><br/>Conversely, the road you probably haven't beaten yet is that of becoming a proactive participant in the game, with music being your own share of unbridled creative input. This will work better for a much more "improvisational" game than what you're describing above, of course \u2014one without any single "GM", for example. I'm picturing a 5-players game of <i><a href="http://www.tao-games.com/hello-world/" rel="nofollow">Polaris</a></i> with all players being musicians\u2026 They take turns, not just "sitting out" as a 5th player (if you're not familiar with it, <i>Polaris</i> is basically a 4-players game in which players take turns covering 4 separate and equally important player-roles), but playing whatever music they like, and of course the mood of the music is going to affect the mood of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423594/#Comment_423594" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-01T04:34:40+00:00" title="November  1, 2013  4:34AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My wife has DJ'd for us as we play!

The first year it happened it didn't really add much, but the second year I heard better things about it, it sounded like getting the interaction between the musician and the game, primarily getting the musician to learn how best to involve themselves with the game, was the main factor. I believe the GM had primed the musician with certain requirements before the game ran (i.e. they are going to visit a market at some point, I could do with bustling market music) but then from what I understand it was very much a GM'd game rather than a free flowing sandbox.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lassek" title="Lassek"><img alt="Lassek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lassek">Lassek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423618/#Comment_423618" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-01T12:27:49+00:00" title="November  1, 2013 12:27PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2013 12:28PM by Lassek.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the replies so far!\n<blockquote></blockquote>\nThe notion that the music were constricting control is foreign to me. I'm not an outside group! I'm not playing just anything I want, I'm in the same mood as the narration. It can't be a distraction to the game, because it is part of the game. Initially I considered alternating speech and music too, but our (me and the GM) final sentiment was that it'd be too slow; moreover, the music would have had to be a lot more structured and careful because it is the only focus for attention every other while. And I don't get paid! Small predefined motifs <i>would</i> be a possible way to interact with narration, though, as the cadences are, but how?\n<blockquote></blockquote>\nI haven't. I'm completely new to the storygame genre. Having scrounged for bits of info, the point of that game apparently is that there is no GM and music actually is in control of the mood? Which would mean in my case that I was a GM (of sorts... a Game Maestro!). Could very well be worth a shot, but I'm worried that instrumental music could be difficult to interpret. \n<blockquote></blockquote>\nThanks for the elaborate reply. It seems I did indeed forget some things or some things were unclear in my head. Sorry! I don't consider myself subject to the GM as much as subject to the story which he and I have agreed upon; this includes selecting motifs and patterns that suit a number of submoods or important events. We made the arrangement because we wanted to really minimise OOC communication about mechanics during the game; when the system was at its best, we had talked with the players about how their characters will act and react, with the additional intention to be more historically accurate for the 17th century game. The problem ensued that in the end, the characters had only limited power over the course of the story and their interaction with it was mainly emotional, the game resembled an improvised play, and perhaps just that wasn't to the GM's liking. And I can agree that unpredictable PCs are the salt of RPGs... (What should <i>the GM</i> think or do? Is a GM-less group intrinsically better suited? Should I become GM in place of the GM?) I have a suspicion some narrative mechanics could alleviate the tendency to railroading, but which? I remember about a cool mechanic where players could write anything on a piece of paper, slip it to the GM, who would be obliged to include whatever was on it in the game; this caused much silliness but the GM had some time to prepare for the unexpected. Perhaps work something off that? <br/><br/>Thinking back, I have occasionally succeeded in interacting with the players' emotions in a limited fashion, but it could indeed be something to constantly (and consciously...) strive for. After that, I think the solution lies in the small things, and good execution, and a good platform (the well-defined GM/player turns on the stage, even if short). <br/><br/>I'll definitely want to try out a proactive all-musician game once the occasion presents itself. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Playing while talking is extremely difficult... everyone could accompany the next person's narration.  And musical c(l)ues could really be used with all force, for dramatic interventions etc.\n<blockquote></blockquote>\nSweet, a DJ'd game sounds very interesting too. I'd like to know how that panned out.\n<blockquote></blockquote>\nDone and done.\n<blockquote></blockquote>\nWell! Very interesting. That sounds exactly like my case. I hope I'll run into that person soon. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423873/#Comment_423873" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-07T06:27:50+00:00" title="November  7, 2013  6:27AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2013 6:28AM by lizziestark.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are a number of live games that use music as the core mechanic (though rarely live music, I think). The Nordicans in particular are very into using music to set mood and emotion, and sometimes as a core mechanic of the game.<br/><br/>- Love in the Age of Debasement by Erlend Eidsem Hansen (larpsfromthefactory.com), in which player couples choose theme songs that control their play.<br/>- Stereohearts by Maria Ljung and Helene Willer Piironen, a game about love where the players interact solely through playing songs to one another (<a href="http://scenariofestival.se/scenarios/stereo-hearts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://scenariofestival.se/scenarios/stereo-hearts/</a>)<br/>- Superheroes' World by an international team, which uses songs and dancing as conflict mechanics.

This act of the larp took place in a car. When a song they'd chosen came on the radio, play focused on their character.<br/><br/>I once played a tango larp where the number of songs denoted the length of the act. That seems like it would suit itself well to a live band.<br/><br/>I also played a poetic blackbox larp recently. It had no words at all, just physical mechanics and mood set by a playlist of Johnny Cash, Tom Waites, and Nick Cave.
