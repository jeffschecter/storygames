I died less than I expected to which may be because it was under a GM who'd never experienced Paranoia before.<br/><br/>The cards are a weird addition but weren't so bad. They caused a couple of hilarious moments but could be patched out if you think they're too much of an obstruction.<br/><br/>The system itself is different, but simple enough to be fine. I think sometimes the system could be a little too present but here it gets out of the way just enough. I love the "Computer Dice" and have a few ideas for Friend Computer to help.<br/><br/>I was one of two people who died right near the end, which meant most of the failings of the group were blamed on our previous clones. <br/><br/>XP Points are a good quick hit of an inventive and in the set we were using, the wipe-clean character sheets meant there was a lot of 'flair' added to our sheets. <br/><br/>The tone of the book is good. It keeps things fun, inclusive and bypasses a lot of the bad Paranoia-ing (e.g. blocking any rules questions with comments about how things like that are above our clearance level).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
