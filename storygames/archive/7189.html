A part of that is the notion that the rules of the game are rather lightweight in instruction; I'll want prospective players to learn the game from web-sources, not from a thick rulebook that is largely unnecessary for those parts of the audience who already know how to play any similar games.<br/><br/>One thing I'd be interested in trying would be a video demo of the sort Ron did for <i>Spione</i>. However, there are some constraints:\n<ul><li>I'm targeting an American audience for the most part. Consequently, I'd want to make the demo movie in America to make speech and such intelligible.</li><li>I'll be in America for Gencon, myself, which will surely aid in making a video.</li><li>I don't much feel like carrying a video camera, microphones and whatnot to USA and back.</li></ul>\nThe obvious solution to my woes is to ask an interested native to take the equipment to Gencon and help me in filming a session of the game. The game, from start to finish, takes a couple of hours, so it wouldn't be impossible to outright film the whole thing. I think that I could edit all the internet video I want from one passable session of the game, assuming we could fix the audio in an acceptable manner.<br/><br/>Is this feasible, do you think? Anybody with camera experience and a suitably lightweight camera want to give it a try? I'm most interested in the audio quality insofar as production quality goes, myself; that's the most annoying flaw in most amateur videos. I'm probably not up to paying a lot for this, but there'd certainly be a copy of <i>Zombie Cinema</i> in it for anybody willing to cameraman for me. We could burn the footage on a couple of disks and take it back to Europe that way, or something of the sort.<br/><br/>If anybody happens to have significant video-making experience, feel free to point out flaws in the plan. I haven't done anything of the sort myself, really.<br/><br/>Although it's probably premature, if anybody wants to star in my zombie-rpg-movie, we'll see if we can make it work at Gencon some night. Should take 2-3 hours with 4-5 players, all told. Rumour has it that <i>Zombie Cinema</i> is not only the most Romero-faithful zombie game around, but also a top contender for a simple and immediately playable drama game where you get to eat your friends alive, metaphorically speaking.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
