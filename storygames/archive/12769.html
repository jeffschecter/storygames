And this has been a problem.<br/><br/>So I'm on one extreme - the game is a priority for me and I am always there and on time. I am a little mental. My brother is on the other extreme - he's primarily there to socialize, and his family commitments are hard to predict, so he often misses a session at the last minute.<br/><br/>So it has been problematic for my brother, because he doesn't want to screw up the game, and for me, because it's impossible to do anything but one-shots without worrying about continuity and attendance. Everybody else is somewhere strung out between us, and we are all good friends. We want it to work for everybody.<br/><br/>So here's what we decided: The four guys who are closer to my end (always there, usually on time) will arrange to run or facilitate games and play the protagonists. The three guys closer to my brother's end can either opt in for that game (if they know they'll be around for the next four weeks, say), or they can create secondary characters or pick up NPCs session-to-session as they wish. Everybody is on board with this. It takes pressure off the guys who may have to bail at a moments notice, and allows the game to go forward no matter what. <br/><br/>So the unpredictable guys still get to hang out when they can and roleplay, and I don't think their participation will be in any way diminished. The game just won't revolve around their guys. <br/><br/>It's a novel approach for us. Have you ever had to adjust how you play based on the needs of the larger group? Have you ever played with different levels of commitment among players?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287154/#Comment_287154" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T08:39:12+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  8:39AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I am doing this right now.

Some of our play has been one-shots, which are no big deal.  For our multi-session Mouse Guard game, we handwaved any absences or substituted a one-shot if the GM or too many players were absent.  The structure of MG facilitated the occasional absence; the discrete GM's turn/player's turn/reward at end of session provided pauses in the action that made a character's sudden unavailabilty more plausible.  "He got stuck in town dealing with a, umm, a...bee!  Yes, a bee!  Now, then..."  We did decide that the last session required everyone's presence for it to be a fitting end; took us about three of weekly sessions before we pulled that off.  <br/><br/>It'll be interesting to see how we deal with it in our ongoing AW game.  Back in the day, I played in a Rolemaster game with waaaay too many players.  The GM's conceit was a giant golden globe that would suck up any characters with missing players, and spit them back out when the player could show up.  Maybe I can do the same thing with the Maelstrom...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287162/#Comment_287162" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T08:56:55+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  8:56AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Always!<br/><br/>In college (25 years ago now) I ran a game club so I was the committed one. The different level of commitment just killed serious campaigns. D+D worked because it really wasn't serious. If an adventurer missed one dungeon crawl it didn't matter. Eventually this moved me toward game sessions that were structured like half hour TV shows, very fast and straight forward. I knew what they would encounter no matter what they did so in effect it was rail roading (except that the players enjoyed the ride). After I got married I started to be the one who was less able to be there. A lot of my gaming shifted completely to one shots but more to board games and play by email games. <br/><br/>What really gets in the way of my gaming now is honestly game making. It takes a lot of time writing and printing games and a heck of a lot more energy selling them. It is to the point where I'd have to describe myself more as a book binder than a gamer. I like PBEMs and face to face boardgames but I can't remember how long it has been that I've had the time for a role play campaign. That was what high school and college were about. <br/><br/>Sad really.<br/><br/>I do have hopes to game more when I stop selling games. I have a plan to have fun in my retirement! I bought 15mm zombie figures at Origins and I expect to use them in miniatures games for many years to come. Story miniature games. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287168/#Comment_287168" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T09:08:15+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:08AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one of my ongoing Apocalypse World games, the standing rule is if I and one other person can make it, then game on as per usual.  In addition, we set the games weekly, which is much easier to schedule for people with families: Sunday night is gaming night, and we can plan with that in mind.  I've had much more success with weekly games than any other kind of wonky schedule.  <br/><br/>Happily, there is no Status Quo in Apocalypse World, so it the absence of a player fits the genre.  <br/><br/>I'm also careful to always end the session without a cliffhanger, and avoiding any kind of spotlight character needed to continue a plotline. <br/><br/>I think this works much better with games that don't focus on small unit tactics, like Shadowrun or D&amp;D tends to do.  Though Mouse Guard, with it's focus on teamwork, actually has a mechanic for players missing games, so there are exceptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287175/#Comment_287175" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T09:16:29+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:16AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1 group we solved it by going... bigger! <br/><br/>We had 9 players and decided to invite even more. If we invited 15, 6-10 would should up. Then we ran 2 games at the same time. People who can dedicate themselves to an ongoing game would play in a small 3-5 player RPG game. Everyone else who came late or who couldn\u2019t come often would play a 1 shot RPG, boardgame or even card games like Texas Hold\u2019em. We would all eat together and hand out for 30 minutes after the games ended so people who didn\u2019t play together still socialized. It helped that this was a weekend game.<br/><br/>Another group we merged with 3 other gaming groups and did a limited date player exchange! We figured if multiple groups have the same problems, then there are enough people of a certain type that we can get them all together. <br/><br/>In another group, people who couldn\u2019t play consistently or wanted to primarily socialize would help the GM. They would play NPCs, run monsters, draw maps, plan encounters and more. It was also a great way to slowly train future GMs!<br/><br/>My mostly Thursday group has been going on for close to 6 years and has easily rotated in and out 20+ people. Probably more (technically it was 2 separate groups but I was in both and we played at the same space on the same day). We kept the day fairly consistent, hung out even when we couldn\u2019t get a game together, and rotated GMs. In terms of consistency over a long time span, this was a big win for us. <br/><br/>And I\u2019ve had a lot of success with 4-6 session campaigns. It seems easier to get everyone to dedicate to 1 day a week when they know it is only for 1 month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287178/#Comment_287178" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T09:19:51+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:19AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a good approach, but it only works for some games, clearly. I'm producing a PTA game right now that suffers from this a lot - it's currently on a six-week long hiatus because some players, less invested than others and with more concerns such as securing babysitting, night classes etc, had a series of various weekend conflicts. In most other games, I would've been able to just switch things up a bit and run a side plot with the remaining players, but in PTA that'd be like shooting the story in the back. Thankfully I've been able to get the rest to play Lacuna until we start up again.<br/><br/>A different problem occurs with a game like Warhammer Fantasy that I'm trying to get off the ground - it's not so hard to swap characters in and out, but the complexity of the game demands that the size of the group must be relatively compact and the players relatively competent. I can't be explaining rules over and over at the beginning of each session, and I can't put five or six players into the game because everyone decided to show up at the same time (I don't have a table big enough for all the components, for one).<br/><br/>By contrast, my friend solves this problem by running a Gamist-focused DnD 4E game on a strict schedule - show up and you're in, encounters can be scaled upwards on the fly, but if they don't get at least four players for a session they'll end up as ground beef anyway and they cancel until next session. Clearly there is little in terms of story continuity so that's not an issue.<br/><br/>My biggest, ongoing scheduling problem is getting a group to with the same set of expectations and preferences together all at the same time. It's easy to get a group of people together, but one wants to play DnD, one wants to play Twilight 2013, and one wants to play Happy Birthday Robot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287179/#Comment_287179" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T09:22:22+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:22AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a campaign about futuristic soldiers back in college that, at one point, had something like eight players. But it was badly scheduled and I seldom had that many players at once. I had to be sure that there were separate storylines going on, to lure the players back in, and so that each player had something important involving his or her character on those days when they did show up. But stars naturally emerged as certain players showed up more often than others, and the game naturally became about them. Some players fell organically into support roles, but because they had their turf or niche, I think they still felt distinct and valuable.<br/><br/>But, and this is important, I tried to make sure that it was a fun game to watch, too. Every player was sure to spend some time sitting around, with that kind of queue to speak up next. Having futuristic technology was a boon\u2014people could speak to each other across thousands of miles, weighing in on scenes and encounters in which they were hardly present. That helped people feel involved.<br/><br/>Since then, I've adopted a pretty relaxed attitude toward players speaking with each other even when their characters can't. That helps. One player gets ultimate say over what her character does, but I think it's fine for players to weigh in with ideas and suggestions for each other if it means people feel engaged enough to show up every week. I'd rather have that than a situation where a player feels compartmentalized enough that he can bail for a week and won't be missed. That helps groups unravel, in my experience.<br/><br/>Right now, though, I'm dealing with a situation where I have plenty of people who are interested in playing games... but probably cannot find the time. I need to develop groups that can survive player absences. I need to devise campaigns that will handle the turnover from one player to another with grace, so that things don't dissolve or collapse even if\u2014please no\u20144 out of 5 players turn over inside of six months.<br/><br/>It's super frustrating, though. I don't think I do anything better than run RPGs, and people want to play, but are already locked into other games, and I'm the newcomer so I've got to work with the scraps of other people's schedules. I have a million games I'd like to play and maybe 10-12 hours a month of actual play time to work with, depending.<br/><br/>Now I'm all depressed about it again.

I'm producing a PTA game right now that suffers from this a lot - it's currently on a six-week long hiatus because some players, less invested than others and with more concerns such as securing babysitting, night classes etc, had a series of various weekend conflicts. In most other games, I would've been able to just switch things up a bit and run a side plot with the remaining players, but in PTA that'd be like shooting the story in the back. Thankfully I've been able to get the rest to play Lacuna until we start up again.</blockquote>\nPTA is one of our go-to games, and the one that we're struggling with right now.  To implement this new solution with PTA, we're just going to have the four regular players run the main characters (who get spotlights) and the rest of us will play support roles all the time (i.e. no spotlights, maybe a 2 screen presence whenever we play).  We're hoping that will work out well, and keep the story more tightly-focused.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>In another group, people who couldn\u2019t play consistently or wanted to primarily socialize would help the GM. They would play NPCs, run monsters, draw maps, plan encounters and more. It was also a great way to slowly train future GMs!</blockquote>\nThis is partly what we were thinking- we're a pretty big on sharing authority in our games even when there is a GM, so there's always room for someone to play walk-on characters, frame scenes, etc.  We played Fiasco last night with five regular players and two "producers" who stepped in with scene-framing suggestions and picked the Tilt elements.

It's that, unless they're facing a life-threatening emergency that they encountered on the way to the game or are having some kind of a major life crisis, it's trivial to pick up a phone and say "I'm not going to make it tomorrow night."  Oddly enough, the people I have known who did have life-threatening emergencies or major life crises had the courtesy to phone to say they would not make it, while the people who blew off the game session without notice tended to be the clueless flakes lacking in social skills -- and they did it <i>repeatedly.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287352/#Comment_287352" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T17:18:27+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  5:18PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2010 5:20PM by lachek.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charlton, that's a pet peeve of mine, too.

Somehow they have time for <i>that</i>, which means that it's not a matter of "having time" for RPGs, but rather where you rate RPGs on your list of priorities. It's been my experience that those who do not make it a priority seem to think that others prioritize the hobby in a similarly casual manner, and seem not to understand the issue with showing up an hour late, if at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287355/#Comment_287355" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T17:26:04+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  5:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2010 8:29AM by Rafu.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Charlton">@Charlton</a> Wilbur: no, I was <b>not</b> pointing at you.

It did help that the character was a Stormbull, and the player was very dynamic when he was there, and was totally down with whatever happened to his PC when he wasn't there.<br/><br/>In some college campaigns, with a traditional style game, most of the action happened in the wilderness, we'd just assume the missing player's PC was off in the woods taking care of nature.<br/><br/>On players letting the group know if they will be there or not - yea, I've got some pet peeves about this. These days, my time is really valuable, if you can't have the decency to let us know in a reasonable fashion that you won't be making it, I'm going to look for a way to game without you.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287608/#Comment_287608" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T13:41:34+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  1:41PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our solution, as our "Friday gaming group" has gotten older and more committed with other hobbies, families, kids, jobs et al has been to flip to casual, one-shot play, and a lot of board games.<br/><br/>So Fridays has a handful of regulars, and a lot of people who come by semi-regularly, and a few people who show up once in a blue moon.  It's all good.  If someone wants to start a particular RPG or other long form game (like, say, Advanced 3rd Reich), then they pull from that pool of people (and also broader social circles), and pick some other night to play on.

Our best fix has just been to have a solidly scheduled game night, and we play that night no matter what the attendance is (unless it's, y'know, nobody). We do what we can to establish "outs" for everyone's characters, especially the unreliable guys, so that if they don't show, it can be handwaved.<br/><br/>The benefit of the fixed-night is that it (theoretically) allows people to schedule around it. We play Thursdays, so everyone knows to make sure they aren't working late that night, not join other groups or plan activities then, or whatever. It has mixed success, but I find the only way I can make it to gaming AT ALL is to know well in advance when it's happening, otherwise my calendar fills.<br/><br/>I have another semi-regular game that I'm running with a group of new RPers, and their commitment to the game is actually quite a bit higher than my weary regulars. It plays less-frequently, though, which helps. This past week, we had our first absence, and I actually weaved the non-presence of that character into the game, and made it a plot thread for the players to chase down. Of course when that player comes back, I'm going to have to figure out how to reintegrate the character, but I'll think of something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288203/#Comment_288203" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-22T23:36:10+00:00" title="August 22, 2010 11:36PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a method for running a campaign that a friend has been using to good effect -- and that I'm about to try out soonish:<br/><br/>1. have a largish pool of players.<br/><br/>2. post a date that suits you (the person organizing the game.)<br/><br/>3. there are spots for the N (say 4) players in the game.
