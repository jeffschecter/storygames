It had become a pit used by spammers.  I ended up with ownership of the group, and have cleaned it up; anyone I could positively identify as a spammer was removed, and I deleted all of the spam messages.  It's also set up that new members need to be approved, and new members are moderated.  There will be no more spam there if I can help it.  <br/><br/>So, if anyone wants to make use of it as a resource, it's there.<br/><br/>Oops, almost forgot.
