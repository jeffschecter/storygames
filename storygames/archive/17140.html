You hate your job.<br/><br/>The district doesn\u2019t give you nearly enough money to run your classroom, and things are slowly slipping into dysfunction. Your peers, the professors who get the pleasure of teaching young magical prodigies, have little respect for you or what you do. To them, you\u2019re basically just a glorified babysitter. Nowadays, you\u2019re starting to think that they\u2019re right.<br/><br/>The minotaur kid with emotional-behavioral problems is one violent sumbitch. The mentally disabled kid wants to fly with the Broom Squad; she spends most of her time flailing around in midair making noises that you reason are cries of happiness. The juvenile fire elemental just sits there, staring (why is he in here anyway?).<br/><br/>Every day is a struggle when you\u2019re teaching the magically-sensitive kids that nobody else wants to deal with. Are you brave enough to enter the Dungeon?</i><br/><br/>    * Be a Teacher and try to bring order to chaos any way you can<br/>    * Be a Client, and give your friends hell<br/>    * Modify your Client\u2019s behaviors through accomplishing objectives from their Individualized Educational Plans<br/>    * An auction mechanic that can let the Teachers reap great rewards, or lead to grand amounts of educational dysfunction</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.miserytourism.com/the-dungeon/" rel="nofollow">miserytourism.com/the-dungeon/</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
