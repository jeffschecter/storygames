The hangings by the window hardly stir in the heavy, thick air of midnight.<br/><br/>His youngest CONCUBINE lies sleepless at the foot of his bed, looking out at the moon and wondering about her past: how did she come to be here, in this ancient and dusty place?<br/><br/>Outside, scaling the wall in total silence, the Sumerian ASSASSIN has finally reached the top of the minaret and is but a short leap from the Sultan's bedroom.<br/><br/>What is about to happen?<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>You are playing this game.

(For example, an opportunity to grant a boon to the most deserving character, or something like that.) Or perhaps something where good answers are rewarded, or ignoring my curiousity is punished.

These questions are written down and the players direct the story (in their scene play) toward these questions and ultimately answer them; in this way you (i.e. the question poser) are choosing the direction of the story and what is important in it. You  continue to pose and write down these questions for the entire length of the story.<br/><br/>This mechanic works extremely well to address one of the major problems in story gaming: story threads branching off into incongruent  directions and creating a poor, unsatisfying story and ending. This mechanic tends to creates stories in which the narrative threads are weaved tightly. The narrative threads don't branch off into multiple unconnected directions making it difficult or impossible to bring the threads back together for a satisfying ending. It tends to produce good stories and good endings. <br/><br/>My upcoming story game "House of Spiders" uses a form of this mechanic. I'm designing five story games right now and all of them have a version of this mechanic in them; that's how much I believe in it and it's ability to help shape a great game story. In most of the games the group comes up with these narrative questions; in one of them a single player does, as in the above example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463141/#Comment_463141" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-08T12:02:05+00:00" title="May  8, 2017 12:02PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh yeah, Jeph - that's exactly what I was thinking of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463155/#Comment_463155" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-08T17:20:28+00:00" title="May  8, 2017  5:20PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff and Eero -<br/><br/>Asking questions is a great technique, I agree.

This probably has to do with how the other player has been playing their character.<br/><b>2)</b> As the claim about the character's internal state is floated to the other players, the advocate player (the player whose character it is) gets to refute the claim - they disagree about this, or think that while there is some merit to the claim, their character has the strength of will to refuse it and not act on the impulse the other player introduced.<br/><b>3)</b> An appropriate sort of conflict resolution procedure is called to resolve the issue. We find out what merit, if any, the call had. Maybe the advocate player just buys off the claim with some willpower points or something. There's a continuum of wise choices here, rooted in the kind of understanding the game fosters about the nature of human cognition.<br/><br/><i>Pendragon</i> has a system for this, to pick a famous example: you get a character into a situation that tests their virtue, you call for a test, and then we find out whether the character can keep it together in the face of temptation. I like this because it polices the players and enforces psychological realism better than a system where the players cannot question each other's roleplaying choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463207/#Comment_463207" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-09T21:26:17+00:00" title="May  9, 2017  9:26PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if -after a certain amount of questions are answered- the audience player could make up a connection between two characters and reveal it as a twist when they interact?

An observing player could use that to "upshift" or "downshift" the speed at which effective time passes in play.<br/><br/>Games like Monkeydome or Swords Without Master switch tones, from Grim to Zany (or whatever other terms). An observing player could have a means of "flipping that switch" mid-scene.<br/><br/>* I can say, "Cut!", to close/end the scene.<br/><br/>The power to end the scene changes the dynamic in play (the participants are suddenly much more aware of the presence of the observing player, and that player has a different level of attention to the scene, too). It also allows one to place emphasis on a certain line of dialogue or action: if the scene closes immediately after that bit of dialogue, it lends a certain weight. <br/><br/>"She says, 'I'm done with this marriage!' and storms out of the room, slamming the door."<br/><br/>If we cut the scene immediately after that, it has a very different weight than if we continue the scene to show the reaction of the other party and what they do next - not just in terms of the fiction, but also in terms of the experience for the players.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463550/#Comment_463550" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-25T04:56:47+00:00" title="May 25, 2017  4:56AM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is that all we've got?

In my version of this, I am not in the scene but I do have a character that I will bring in to later scenes. My characters powers are acquired by introducing wrinkles that result in mixed outcomes. If the things I introduce result in either an unmitigated success or failure, I earn nothing. If the result instead expands the story, my character is powered up.  <br/>Would have to be a particular game where there is both a narrator and a player contributing as the narrators sidekick in a given scene. <br/><br/>I say:  a tile clatters from the conical minaret roof. It tumbles ringing once on a rock wall as it falls, landing with the sugary sound of a distant shattering.  The assasin has slid half the way down the steep pitch, arresting himself, his body spread out against the slick tiles.  Far below a sentry pivots in His small pool of torchlight to investigate the sound. The concubine lies motionless, listening. Perhaps making her mind up.
