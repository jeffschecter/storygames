Love the setting; extremely evocative. I've even got my head around the core mechanic, which didn't make much sense to me at first (It's easier to level a city than bring one person to life? But of course, if you commit more dice you change that guy's destiny; and the more dice you commit, the greater the chance you'll get locked in). But I've been left scratching my head how you start a game, and how you complete it.<br/><br/>At the heart of my confusion is my ambivalence about the need for two GMs; is this really necessary? It isn't clear to me what their agendas are, or that they are in such opposition that the role needs to be divided. My fear is that neither role appears to be a huge task and that there's a risk that one would dominate the other.<br/><br/>I also find the end game problematic. With the various Fallen all receiving Judgement different times, where's the fun or incentive for a player being the first to do so? With so many variables, it seems inevitable that a lucky, cautious player will end up evading judgement for longer than an unlucky, cavalier player. Yet once judgement has been received, that player character's story is effectively over; and if they become mortal there's a good chance their character won't even be alive by the time the ext Fallen gets a chance to do the same.<br/><br/>Any hints or tips from anyone with experience at running the game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
