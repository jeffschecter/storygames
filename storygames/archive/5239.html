It does happen, but just not that often. I'm wondering if any of you have had any game moments where you were actually scared, a bit frightened, or just freaked out. I've played a few horror genre games, and often I'll be role-playing the fear my character experiences either narratively or mechanically, but I've never had any similar experience myself as a player. Has anyone been lucky enough to experience a bit of thrill-ride fright or unsettling creepiness? Any details would be awesome.

Since the stupid federal government told me it was "illegal" to write a game with Russian Roulette as the central mechanic, I went with <a href="http://www.enworld.org/showthread.php?t=194714" rel="nofollow">Jenga</a> instead.<br/><br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showpost.php?p=7551399&amp;postcount=13" rel="nofollow">This post over here</a> is answering a different question, but definitely hits on why Jenga works to bridge the gap. The physical nature of it is hard to ignore and drags the player experience right in line with the characters.<br/><br/>So, with that little bit of self-promotion out of the way (<i><a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16200" rel="nofollow">buy Dread!</a></i>), check this out . . .\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>Ha. Definitely a lot of external stuff, like darkened rooms and candles. I wonder if it's possible to play a scary game during the middle of the day?</blockquote>\nIt is! Or at least in my experience it has been possible. I much prefer a dark quiet place to play, and that's how I used to try to set things up whenever I played Dread with friends. But years of demoing the game under harsh con lighting and in crowded rooms, I've discovered that a horror game can be played to full, terrible effect under almost any conditions as long as the players are ready to buy in. The player buy in is the killer. If you don't have that, you don't have horror. But if you do have it, the atmosphere is far more durable than would be expected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
