[It also occurred to me that there are almost no good starship minatures wargames still in print, which is one of the reasons I'm thinking about this.]   And that got me thinking about doing an Apocalypse World hack for Space Opera.  Call it Infinite Worlds.<br/><br/>So, gathering my thoughts in this thread, and wondering what you all think.  <br/><br/>First thing is a question of rules and theme.  In Apoc World as written, the rules are written to be about <i>scarcity,</i> full of restraining choices on bad rolls of the dice and where you've never got enough oddments a-jingle to get what you need.  Problems stem from hunger and thirst and disease.  How can you make this work in a story about, well, infinite worlds?<br/><br/>As it happens, I've already got a universe I've been working on, and, well.  Garden worlds, <i>good</i> planets, are rare in that setting.  It's a war story to begin with, with humanity fighting among itself and a bunch of alien factions for prime real estate, and for profitable trade routes.  Art and culture, wine and cheese, blueprints and sheet music - that sort of thing is for sale across the stars.  And in space itself, on a starship?  Better hope your life support doesn't fail and you haven't got replacements...<br/><br/>So, there's that.<br/><br/>This is a universe with alien races, but frankly they're catgirls and catboys, amphibious cephalopodes (that's squid and octopi, Kyle), draconic sapients, nothing really weird or original <i>by design.</i>  I'm wondering given that if the aliens are just part of your characters Look, or if they deserve their own moves (and if they do, humans CERTIANLY do: humanity's 'hat' in this universe was always 'the guys who don't quit and don't die,' compared to the cheetas and lizards and squid).  Maybe both? I could see a playbook with Look choices restricted like so:  "Feminine, Masculine, Ambiguous, Concealed, Transgressive; Human, Suil: Sharp face, hungry face" and so on (and that left off two on purpose).<br/><br/>The Weird stat.  I can see this stat going in two directions:  <i>Wired,</i> that is, transhuman and plugged in with "Open your brain to a machine" as it's move, or <i>Psychic</i> and drawing on the higher dimensions used for FTL travel ("Transspace," because once you go there you aren't in space anymore, Toto.)  Transspace was always, in my mind, something like the collective unconscious or the platonic realm anyway.  I seem to like that concept a LOT, and am leaning more towards that, but I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Starship weapons.  Honestly, this is the genesis of the project: I'd like to AT LEAST adapt something to tabletop starship rules.  Got custom moves for different starship weapons already here, based on the premise that guns are to constrain movement, missiles are to waste ammo, and energy weapons do the REAL damage:<br/><br/><b>When you strike a starship with ballistic weapons,</b> roll+hard.  On a 10+, choose two; On a 7-9 choose one - <br/>- that ship is acting under fire <br/>- that ship takes harm, as established<br/>- that ship takes -2 forward.<br/> On a miss, avoiding your fire is trivial and they're in a good place to return the favor.<br/><br/><b>When you strike a starship with directed energy weapons,</b> roll+cool.  <br/>On a 10+, you inflict terrible harm and can disable one system.  <br/>On a 7-9, you inflict harm <i>or</i> disable one system.  <br/>On a miss, your hit wasn't focused enough to do anything before the enemy headed for your weapon arc blind spots.<br/><br/>So, yeah.  Stuff to think about.  What do you all think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo" title="theloneamigo"><img alt="theloneamigo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/546/n3LSBO7Z43MJI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo">theloneamigo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332200/#Comment_332200" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T03:56:57+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  3:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm actually working on a hack with substantial starship combat myself; it's for 40k, which has a very distinct take on starship combat, but you might appreciate having a look at it <a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B3c8gGVv-YzVYTMzNjNmNzctNjZjOC00ZDhjLTljY2QtZmI1OWY0ODkwZWEy&amp;hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">here</a>; specifically, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COqP10IPz52WrD8cgcF6I3CdRBQZRk4Fk-340PrNZ_M/edit?hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">starship rules</a>.<br/><br/>In my game, the character's starship is essentially another character, built from a playbook, with their own stars and their own set of basic and extended moves. It's important in starship-based games that a ship is more than just a piece of gear that the characters pick up and discard at will; most media in this mold paints the ship as being a real part of the dramatis personae. Of course, you wouldn't have to go as far down this route as I did - the systems used for designing a holding or a driver's car are just as valid in this context as the route I took.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
