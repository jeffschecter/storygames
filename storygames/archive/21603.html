                    So I want to try to set up a "probable story arch" to get the best bang for my storytelling buck for an upcoming campaign. I enjoy the resonance that comes with a satisfying story that not only has a beginning, middle, and end, but also hits on the Jungian archetypes found in the Hero's Journey or <a href="http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit" rel="nofollow">Harmon Circles</a> (#103 and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23104&amp;Mode=like">#104</a> is where it gets into the juicy details, so read a few in the series).<br/><br/>The problem is that I also don't want to railroad players. <br/><br/>One way I think I might be able to solve this is to prep in such a way that creates an optimal path through "my" story, but gives players complete agency to veer off the path as much as they want. And then I have to be strong and not use any illusionist techniques to guide them back onto the path, trusting in my prep and hoping they come back. And, well, if they don't, that has to be okay.<br/><br/>Here are my notes for an introductory adventure for D&amp;D 5e, incorporating Harmon Circles.<br/><br/><b>Troll Troubles</b><br/><br/>A troll moves into the area, causing trouble, stealing livestock. Turns out that he's not that vicious, and he's not the real problem.<br/><br/>1. Introduce the village of Wraithwalk. Life is good. Establish PCs' gentle foibles. Make the players love the village and its residents.<br/><br/>2. Livestock is going missing. Why? Is it undead? Is the spiritcircle broken? Adon Elkwarden's oldest daughter goes missing.<br/><br/>3. The Elders ask the PCs to walk the spiritcircle around the village (4.4 miles) and check it for missing stones. Discover huge footprints and sheep guts and bones leading out into the wilderness. <br/><br/>4. Track them? It's getting dark. It's heading into the deathcrags, known for being haunted. Feel like you're being watched, followed (unbound ancestor spirits!).<br/><br/>5. Encounter the troll. It's a family of trolls. They're friendly-ish, though scared and volatile. They've killed a lot of the bad undead. Fight or talk, PCs' choice.<br/><br/>6. But the troll didn't take the young woman! Who did? There are screams coming from near the village...<br/><br/>7. On the way back, they run into the young woman, controlled by a scary possession demon. She's kidnapped Beraj Griffonborn (age 8) from the village. The trolls might help?<br/><br/>8. They return to the village. The PCs' gentle foibles are now extra endearing. The minor problems with NPCs are temporarily overcome. Maybe they introduce the troll. Does the village accept it?<br/><br/>Note the 1-8 are octants of the Harmon Circles. <br/><br/>Now, I totally grant that, at any point, the PCs might do something I did not expect, ignore something I did not expect them to ignore, and go do something else. I've tried to frame things as plot hooks that are either <i>interesting</i> (and potentially full of adventure) or <i>responsibilities</i> (and there are consequences for ignoring them). Most likely, when the village council asks you to do something, you do it. But maybe you don't. <br/><br/>In <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, I am assuming that the party will try to track the footprints and viscera leading to the sheep murderer. This is what D&amp;D parties always do. However, I cannot force it. Am I "forcing" it by making it the most obvious path forward? Is this railroading? I think I am not too worried about it. If the party comes up with another idea or decides to go home and ignore their task, I guess I'd play my world-characters properly: The trolls continue to steal sheep and maybe eventually scare a farmer. Maybe the village rounds up a posse to go deal with the trolls. Of course, killing the trolls doesn't solve the kidnapping problem, because the trolls didn't kidnap any people; the demon did.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a> is a little Force-y? To me, it's an event that happens that night. If the PCs are in the village that night, then maybe they don't hear it and the demon-possessed woman gets away with kidnapping Beraj. Over time, she kidnaps more people. Maybe the PCs patrol the perimeter of the village circle and encounter her later. This isn't me using Force to guide them back to my plot. This is me playing my world-characters.<br/><br/>I think there's a pretty big likelihood of my story going the way I planned, yet there's room for players to do something different. <br/><br/>Thoughts?                 </div>

                            Sandra is right. The best thing to do is to create a situation to which the PCs must respond. You can do a little aggressive scene-framing once they decide upon a course of action, but generally you want to avoid planning "beats" of a story that assume particular choices or particular decisions.<br/><br/>The first thing you might want PCs to think about when they're creating their characters is how they're connected to this village full of endearing characters, if they are at all. But if you're playing a 5th edition game with backgrounds and so forth, encouraging them to connect their backstories to the village is a good idea. This is going to be their Shire, right?<br/><br/>Then begin play with things happening. Not "the elders ask you to go investigate." Your uncle's sheep have been going missing, what do you do? The Elkwarden girl is wild and maybe getting into things she shouldn't, hanging out with the old hedge witch who lives near the spirit stone circle. Her dad is worried and asks a PC he might trust for help. What do you do? There's bound to be an investigation; when the players start asking questions, Knowledge rolls or Nature rolls or whatever can let you point to the trolls, or the spirits, or whatever. If PCs "refuse the call," you escalate--more sheep disappear, someone spots a troll, the girl goes missing, until the PCs step over the threshold and start facing their trials.<br/><br/>Start with a simple, strong situation and let the PCs act within it. Allow consequences of those actions to shape what happens next. You'll get a story out of it.                         </div>

                            Consider stealing the character/village generation stuff from Beyond the Wall; The game itself is kinda bog standard trying-to-do-something-different-with-D&amp;D-but-it's-basically-still-D&amp;D stuff, but the chargen/village creation invests the characters in the village because they're all FROM there and know stuff about it already.<br/><br/>Heck, if everyone GREW UP here, it solves a lot of problems all by itself.<br/><br/>I think a lot of Sandra's stuff is nitpicky ("What if they die to the trolls?" Then the game is over, don't introduce death as a stake if you're not willing to stake it.) but she's spot on with "What if they decide it's DARK and they don't want to track something right now?"  Yeah, a life is at stake, but some people are pretty cautious.  Screams being heard, likewise, is tricky.  Easier to maybe see something burning back there if it's still dark, and also, fires can burn for a while so it makes more sense to step out of a cave and be all "Uh oh, something's on fire (and could have been for a while)" vs. "Hey, someone is screaming all of a sudden."                        </div>

<br/><br/>I left out a bit of setup that might help. Maybe not!<br/><br/>The PCs are all made from a list of characters who live in the village. These are not outsiders. They are all from one of the five big families.<br/><br/>The circle around the village is a ritual the village casts every so often to keep the undead out. Everyone in the village is part of keeping the circle intact.<br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>,<br/><br/>Harsh is fine. I expected this to be controversial.<br/><br/>Realize though that this is me experimenting with forms. I _know_ how to railroad. I know specific techniques to make sure I'm nowhere near a railroad. I see this as something in between, where player agency matters but where I have a story that might happens.<br/><br/><br/>Your questions:<br/><br/>"Why would the PCs do the menial task of just checking for missing stones?" Why would anyone? They are young members of the village with skills other people don't have.<br/><br/>"Why are they even on the elder’s side?" Well, maybe they're not. But most likely, they are, as the character generation creates characters who are members of this village, who are members of these families, and who have ties to people in the village. <br/><br/>But can they ignore the elders? Sure. That's an interesting choice with perils all of its own. At worst, it'd be shunning from the village, meaning no protections. This isn't a standard D&amp;D world where they can just go to another village. It's more like 1100 AD Germany where they probably have nowhere else to go, as no one trusts a stranger, except here there really aren't large cities (catastrophe-dragons destroy them).<br/><br/>"What if they don’t track them? At night?" More sheep die. <br/><br/>"What if they die vs the trolls?" They make up new characters in the village and probably morn the loss of a bunch of their own, young village friends.<br/><br/>"How can they hear the screams + the timing of this feels suuuper convenient, like a force technique." <br/><br/>I'm on the fence about this one. It <b>is</b> super convenient, but I've prepped where and when it happens and I won't change where and when it's noticeable. It's an event. <br/><br/>I mean, it's super convenient that a troll took a sheep, leading to adventure, too, right?<br/><br/><br/>Your suggestion to "randomize the possessed villager’s behavior a bit":<br/><br/>Why? This does not increase or decrease player agency. Do you mean the villager's behavior pre-possession or post-possession? Post-, they're under the control of a demon and they're basically my monster. Why randomize that?                        </div>

                            Adam,<br/><br/>Your degree of prep doesn't sound onerous, your stated flexibility limits how wrong things could go activity-wise, and I agree with you that there's a decent likelihood that your story goes as planned.<br/><br/>One thing I would suggest is that you have some idea of the world and people and time and place beyond your plot.  So if the players do wander away from your plot, they don't just encounter some sort of boring void.  And you'll have confidence in that, and thus be less tempted to railroad (and perhaps more interested in their digressions).<br/><br/>Another thing I would suggest is, during character creation, make sure everyone makes characters who would do # 3 and # 4.  I mean, if they don't then they don't, but I assume you don't want to create some sort of party which has <i>no</i> interest in looking after their village or respecting the suggestions of its elders.  Maybe include some "Why have you chosen to stay in this village?" and "What debt do you owe the elders?" type questions before play?<br/><br/>Not that Bill and Sandra's suggestions wouldn't also work, but I know you've played like that aplenty, so I'd say go ahead and try the new approach and see how it goes.  If you really do refuse to railroad, and you play your situation-provoking NPCs authentically, then I think your odds of achieving beginning-middle-end, heroic journey structure aren't much better than they would be with the emergent "story now" approach.  But who knows?  Give it a shot!  I'd be especially interested to see, if you tried it more than once with different players, how it'd vary.  <br/><br/>In the end, I suspect the success or failure of this approach might reside largely in how you feel about it -- I doubt it'll make much difference on the players' end.<br/><br/>Ps,<br/>-Dave                        </div>

                            Okay, I get that there's a big difference between "here's a series of problems and what you do is up to you" and "here's a problem and the Elders have asked you to look into it."<br/><br/>It's not that big a difference, though. <br/><br/>I feel like, if the characters come to that conclusion before the elders ask them, great! But eventually, the elders are gonna ask the low-level characters to go check things out.

                            You know what'd be a fascinating experiment?  To run this same plot with the exact same Plan A (hope they follow your story) but the exact opposite Plan B.  That is:<br/><br/>- Get permission for illusionism<br/>- Try not to railroad at all<br/>- If you have to push them back into your plot do so<br/>- Do any pushing artfully, e.g. with coincidence rather than coercion<br/><br/>Then look at the stories and play experiences that result, and compare them to the "no railroading" approach.<br/><br/>Heck, throw in the emergent "story now" approach for a third comparison!<br/><br/>I wonder if anyone would come to a mini-con where it's the same scenario approached with different GM techniques...  Maybe if it's an absolutely killer scenario...                        </div>

                            My only real concern is the assumption that the players love the village and its inhabitants. My long experience with players is that they will rail against any sort of 'see how nice this place is', whether by becoming suspicious that it is all too perfect or deciding that their cynical hard-bitten soopa-killa warriors hate everything peaceful and friendly.<br/><br/>I think if you can do the groundwork and engage the players in the village (mini pre-scenario games are great for this) then the rest should be reasonable. Most players will see a scenario hook and recognise it for what it is, they will then have to decide whether to follow it and engage with the GM's scenario or deliberately ignore it. If they do the latter then you may want to invest in new players.<br/><br/>Befriending the trolls might take a bit more work - perhaps allow the scouting PCs to see them in a peaceful domestic scene to establish that 'trolls are people too' before giving an opportunity for any fighting.<br/><br/>To my eyes it doesn't look too railroad as written, but obviously presentation on the day is everything. Were I a player, I would see each of the waypoints as a reasonable decision for an adventurous young character to take.                         </div>

                            I consider Sandra's stance to be unnecessarily conservative here and agree more with Adam's position - prepping a story and having "GM agency" are not inherently problematic (even if Sandra has experienced problems when she gave them to herself).  I don't really see this as particularly different from literally just planning a timeline of "what NPCs do if the PCs do nothing" -- it just happens to create something of a story if the PCs follow a particular route. (A moderately likely route, given their grounding, but certainly not the only one they could choose.)<br/><br/>I feel like this should run fine - hold on loosely and all that, but if you ask me there's nothing wrong with creating a series of events that CAN lead to a "story arc" if PCs make that happen.                        </div>

No, it's actually huge, depending on what you mean by "the Elders have asked you to look into it." It changes the motivation from intrinsic to extrinsic, and it changes the originators of the solution from the PCs to your NPCs (that is, to you as GM). Ideally, as the GM you're giving the PCs information, not telling them what to do.<br/><br/>NPC: Our sheep are missing! Go walk the spirit stone circle!<br/>PC: Okay, I go walk the spirit stone circle.<br/>GM: You find sheep bones and sheep guts. Some of the spirit stones have been disturbed. There's a trail leading off toward the Death Crags.<br/>PC: Okay, I guess the elders were right. Um, what do I do now? I guess I'm supposed to follow the trail.<br/><br/>NPC: Our sheep are missing! What on earth is going on? Is it monsters? Is it spirits? Oh, woe is us!<br/>PC: Don't worry, I will help you. I try to look for the sheep.<br/>GM: Make a Nature roll.<br/>PC: I roll okay.<br/>GM: You find some sheep bones and guts at the edge of the village, near the spirit stone walk. Some of the spirit stones have been disturbed. There's a trail of trampled vegetation leading toward the Death Crags in the distance.<br/>PC: Huh. I better tell somebody about this.<br/>NPC: The spirit stones have been disturbed! This is terrible! Ignore everything else and pray for guidance!<br/>PC: Wait, but what about the trail? I better get my friends and go follow it.<br/>Other PC: Are you crazy? Let's gin up a ritual to fix the stones, man.<br/>PC: Can we do that?<br/>GM: Roll Arcana.<br/><br/>In the first example, the PCs are just doing what they're told, following the obvious clue. In the second, they're making consequential decisions about what to do next, and making you give them information rather than waiting for you to tell them what to do. The first may not be railroading, but you're willing to spend a lot of time at the station.                         </div>

                            It's about presentation to the players. In Bill_White's second example above, he has elaborated and made the narrative more interesting to make a point, but the first example could easily be made as interesting and interactive.<br/><br/>Yes, the first example is pushing rather than pulling, but for beginning players that might be what is required. The difference is giving them a path to follow so that they know they are heading in the right direction, and not letting them stumble about looking for clues in the wrong place and getting frustrated. In Bill_White's examples, the second group know immediately to go looking for sheep. What if they instead decide to start interviewing the villagers? What if they don't think to look for tracks but instead head out somewhere randomly? <br/><br/>I don't like 100% sandbox gaming, preferring at least a faint thread to follow. Nothing puts me off a game more than flailing about for a clue as to what the adventure is meant to be. Give me at least a nudge in the right direction to start me on my way. That said, I don't like wholesaling railroading either, I prefer for my actions and decision to make a difference.<br/><br/>GMIng has no 'True Way' but finding the balance between complete player freedom and railroading is largely going to depend on your group. Some players need and want guidance, others are happy to go wandering about doing their own thing.                        </div>

                            But, Bill, this is a village that literally has elders who tell the village what to do, and the PCs are presumed to be among the most junior of villagers. <br/><br/>I also feel like you've intentionally made the first example as boring and railroady as possible, and made the second example as exciting and sandboxy as possible.<br/><br/>GM: Sheep have been going missing. This is the third one. The elders call a meeting.<br/>PC: I'm not going. I go scouting to see what I can find.<br/>GM: Sure, make a Nature check and I'll get back to you in a minute.<br/>Other PCs: Well, we go.<br/>NPC: Our sheep are missing! <br/>Elder NPC: Someone should walk the spirit circle!<br/>PC: We could do it.<br/>GM: All the stones are still intact, so it's not undead breaching the circle. The ranger who skipped the meeting finds a trail of sheep bones and sheep guts leading off toward the Death Crags.<br/>PC: Uh, we're not going to the freaking Death Crags. We report it to the Elders.<br/>Elder NPC: We need heroes to go check out the Death Crags. If not you, then who will go?<br/><br/>In any prep, there's a chance the characters won't bite. There's a chance they'll entirely resist the scenario. That's fine. In any good adventure, there's also a huge consequence for resisting the scenario. Monsters ravage the countryside, the world ends, whatever. In this case, there's a loss of face for the PCs who won't go, plus some hapless NPC will go in their place, probably confront the trolls and get killed. It'll probably be an NPC the party cares about, if I'm playing hard. The demon gets another day or two to further their agenda. Bad stuff happens. Maybe the demon possesses a troll.<br/><br/>I feel like there's a difference between illusionism and playing my NPCs to push the PCs toward what they want.<br/><br/>I feel like there's a difference between cascading consequences of PC actions and using GM Force to guide them back to my story.                        </div>

                            Yeah; This discussion is weird to me. <br/><br/>You can't have a convincing world without NPCs that want things.<br/>In order to keep prep manageable, you will generally prep the NPCs in the world that want things that will somehow affect the PCs.  You don't prep the affair the shopkeeper two towns over is having with the seamstress, because the PCs don't know these characters, they're unlikely meet these characters, and even if they do it's unlikely that the affair will impact the PCs one way or the other.<br/>In the process of prepping those NPCs who want things that involve the PCs, you will probably find some for whom the most reasonable/effective/easy/credible way to pursue those things involves asking the PCs to do something.<br/><br/>To me, those three steps are how you have a convincing living <i>sandbox </i>(instead of just a passive boring sandbox where things only happen because the PCs decided they wanted to make a sandcastle over there because why not, no one else cares.).<br/><br/>To then say "Whoa whoa, you can't have the NPCs <i>ask</i> the PCs to do a thing! That's extrinsic motivation!" is crazy.   What you have to do is understand that the PCs won't necessarily say yes.  Though as a game PREMISE, it's usually fair to say "Hey guys, we're having a game about the small village your characters grew up in, and I'm expecting everyone to have a character who cares about the villages problems." because that is a non-railroading social contract akin to "We're playing D&amp;D, so I don't expect you to make characters who refuse to leave town to go on adventures because 'that might be dangerous'." <br/><br/>When I play Blades in the Dark, there are a ton of other groups active besides the PCs who will sometimes/often ask/bribe/threaten/'gently suggest' the PCs do something.  Am I railroading the PCs because the Red Sashes really want the PCs to stick a knife in the leader of the Crows because they hate her guts but she won't let any of them near her?  No I am not. And neither is "We, the village elders, request that you, able bodied and capable citizens of this village, go look and see whether someone has broken the spirit circle."<br/><br/>I am concerned that this discussion is going the way it is going.                        </div>

I think sandbox adventures aren't meant to be anything.

                            I think I wrote recently about how I've come to really like the campaign frame of "You all work for X, who sometimes gives you dirty jobs to take care of." This thread helps me see why that works so well for me -- once the players have bought into that, they're already aligned with my style to some extent.<br/><br/>Also, I don't really see this as particularly railroaded.  If the players decide that they're going to fix the spirit circle, like Bill said, and then decide that they're going to camp out there to watch for whatever broke the circle and stole sheep (which is what Conan would do, amirite?), Adam's prep isn't worthless, he can move things around on the fly. Maybe the trolls come back for another meal, maybe the possessed girl shows up.  <br/><br/>This <i>does </i>collapse your narrative arc or Harmon circle quite a bit, but I think you have to be willing to do that.                          </div>

                            My prep would include Apocalypse World-style countdown clocks for events, so that I'm not repositioning plot elements on-the-fly, because that would feel too much like illusionism to me. <br/><br/>If I know each NPC's agenda and likely actions over a course of a week, then I can play them fairly, whatever the PCs do or don't do.                        </div>

                            I'm sure you could the run the game fine the way you're planning, Adam, and I bet there would fun to be had in it. But I think you should be aware of how much your plan puts the focus on the village and its NPCs as what's driving the action, rather than the PCs and their desires. Why make the PCs' instrumentality for the NPCs a central part of the game? As a PC, I would find that un-fun. As a player-character, I am always less interested in the GM's story than in my own. Why set it up so that the implicit message to PCs is that they should do what they're told? Isn't that what you're saying when you tell the players "You're all junior members of a village with elders who know what they're talking about"? <br/><br/>I don't know. To me, "the elders assign you a task" is not much different than "you all meet in an inn, and a mysterious stranger hires you for a mission." It's functional, but it's still making the PCs live through the GM's story.<br/><br/>Probably the part that's missing for me is the relationship map of how the PCs are connected to the village and its elders, which you alluded to but didn't put in the forefront of your description of your planning.                        </div>

Indeed, and I generally add enough flexibility into my games that the scenario doesn't break when the players go 'off message'.<br/><br/>However, I have had the misfortune to play a couple of games where the GM gave no such clues or nudges. The first was a Star Trek game back in the mid 1980s. The GM, a Star Trek fan, had lovingly prepared a planetary system, detailing the politics and cultures of each inhabited planet. He then gave us control of a relatively small starship and told us to 'go an explore', presuming that the scenario hooks would become obvious in the manner of an episode of the TV series. Needless to say, we floundered about, landing on planets, talking to people and getting nowhere. In the end the game crashed and burned when we simply set course for home.<br/><br/>The second example was a D&amp;D3.5 game where the GM introduced the scene in the market square of a town. The PCs wandered about and spoke to people but nothing untoward seemed to be happening. Apparently we should have noticed that a small child sat drawing a picture was far too advanced artistically to be natural. However, I don't believe anyone bothered to look at, let alone critique the drawing boy which was presented as so much background information. As it happened, the game again collapsed.<br/><br/>These examples of 'more sandbox than is good' are the dark side of a flexible approach. A few hints or subtle clues would have allowed the scenario to begin. By expecting the players to stumble onto the scenario almost by accident, an overly sandbox game will likely fail.<br/> </div>

+100%<br/><br/>I've been playing a BtW game since last summer, and it's fucking awesome. Make sure you use the sandbox / hexmap generation rules from the first supplement, Further Afield, if you do this: in my opinion, the main book's chargen / village gen process only gives enough for a meaty one-shot plus a few follow-ups, whereas Further Afield's sandbox tool is great for campaigns. Plus, the latter is more system-neutral / easy to export, whereas the stuff from the main book is really tied to BtW's system.                        </div>

                            This is fascinating.<br/><br/>Adam, i'd consider this:<br/><br/>1. What do you gain from organizing your prep this way, compared to another form of prep?<br/><br/>Personally, I find that having such a "storyline" in mind means I get emotionally invested in seeing it come to fruition, which means I won't play the game as well as I would otherwise.<br/><br/>Having a storyline in mind, but vowing not to railroad (I'm not convinced that's possible!)... how is that better for you than just not prepping a storyline?<br/><br/>2. Organizing all the prep in a way that's NOT built around a preset storyline usually makes for more interesting, creative, unique material.<br/><br/>For instance, you've got no details about the Elders, because the PCs basically won't interact with them "on screen". <br/><br/>If you weren't preparing according to the "expected plot", you might have thought of an interesting conflict or problem with the Elders, which would enrich potential ways the whole scenario could resolve. One of them broke the circle, because he wanted to hurt his neighbour's flock? And that's how've this whole thing started? That would be interesting.<br/><br/>(For all I know, you do - but this is an example for illustration.)<br/><br/>3. I agree with Bill, above.<br/><br/>Have the PCs discover the missing sheep. Have them decide whether to go to the Elders right away or explore first.<br/><br/>You've organized all your prep according to a set "plot", but you're planning not to railroad... you've lined up a row of nails and then given yourself a hammer, and now expect yourself to spend your playing time trying *not to use the hammer*?<br/><br/>It's strange.<br/><br/>My sense is that, as a player, I wouldn't feel railroaded, but I also wouldn't feel much agency. There's basically one thing for me to do, in front of me. No interesting choices.<br/><br/>My experience with your suggested playstyle is that it's just not fun to GM. You're tearing yourself between two contradictory impulses the whole time, having primed yourself for one thoroughly by preparing it.<br/><br/>Doing that affects my play of the game - it feels less fun and free play and more like struggling with shaping every contribution to the fiction with little details which nudge the players towards the "hoped-for story".<br/><br/>It feels a bit like meeting a friend for lunch, except you have a a secret agenda for meeting them, so you aren't listening to them as much as you normally would, because you keep planning how you will steer them towards the topic you want the whole time.                        </div>

                            I run <i>DayTrippers</i> (and other games sometimes) via Harmon Circles, but I separate plotting (what I call "horizontal control") from arcing ("vertical control").  Plots come from player actions in that "wide open field".  Arc comes from tension and unresolved stakes, which are modulated by me.  In other words, when we sit down at the table, no plans for plot exist in my head, but the arc is my template and my goal is to deliver on that arc vertically while the players control the horizontal.

                            My own style is to plan the big stuff, the key encounters, and to have a few contingencies for any probable diversions. Important NPCs get detailed in so far as their essential personality, basically the stuff that might influence how they interact and what is driving their motivations. I rarely, if ever, give them a fully statted character sheet.<br/><br/>I am comfortable free-forming when required, but I need some aspects to be consistent. If the lord of Town A is Baron X one week, he needs to be in charge and consistent next week. I also like to pre-plan where possible because I can put more depth in. A situation that grows through plenty of planning, rethinking and refining will usually be more fulfilling than one made up off the top of my head.<br/><br/>I want to tell a story, but if the players don't interact with that story then they are free to make their own up. However, I prefer to have the story in place as a spine onto which any improvisation can be attached.                        </div>

I think this is the crux of it for me. I need to make sure there are plenty of interesting choices in front of the players for them to have agency. <br/><br/>I'm not convinced yet that putting lots of choices in front of the players is incompatible with "optimal path plotting" though.                        </div>

I don't they're <i>incompatible</i>, but it seems like you're tying one hand behind your back as a result. What do you gain by doing this that you don't have from just "putting lots of choices in front of the players"? (It's a sincere question; no a rhetorical one - I'm curious what you, Adam, are getting out of it, or hope to get out of it.)<br/><br/>Again, my personal experience is that it's fairly functional but not much fun to GM. After doing it a few times I just start to scrap the "optimal path" and kept the fun situations and choices. It was a totally unnecessary headache which made my job as GM harder to do and harder to enjoy. Whether that's true for others, I don't know!                        </div>

                            Stories that hit all the octants of the Harmon Circle, or all the points of the Hero's Journey, or whatever, are more satisfying. As I wrote that plot, I had missed some pieces, and adding them in made the story more complete and stronger.<br/><br/>By thinking through those pieces, it is my hope that I'm /prepared for/ player actions and have created possibilities that can hit the octants and not skip steps.

For example, make the root of the problem reside in an inherently other/magical/transformative space.  So if the players care at all about the village, they'll inevitably enter Faerie/The Upside-Down/Wherever in order to address it, just because of the simple facts of the world and the NPCs and the situation.<br/><br/>And then, if you want to support sandbox play, you just have multiple such situations going on with their roots/keys in multiple "other" spaces.<br/><br/>If pursuit of the kidnap-ee necessariy leads to the deathcrags, and journeying through the deathcrags necessarily leads to the discovery that trolls exist, and returning to the village accordingly means that you come back armed with the power of new knowledge about What's Out There (and maybe some ideas about how to use that knowledge you our benefit), we're a good portion of the way there.  "Once you choose this path, the relevant things are where they are," doesn't feel like railroading to me, or at least not in any of the negative senses.                        </div>

What's satisfying for one medium can be counter-productive for another.<br/>In D&amp;D it's more satisfying if the players create the story (through their choices and journey) than if the DM has put it there on a plate for them to just reheat.<br/>I even wrote that in my seeds&amp;petals post, that with prescripting you gain access to tighly edited matching to story beats but at too high a price. (I didn't mention Campbell or Harmon, but Snyder and Kishōtenketsu)<br/><br/>I need to be clear that I know you're willing to stray from the line you've planned here as soon as the players do, that the Harmon Circle was just a way to help you come up with some of the NPCs/monsters/placs in your game world. And so far, so OK. But I want to repeat what Paul said about tying one hand behind your back, to be careful that you don't make the job harder for yourself only for less satisfying (for this medium) results. As me and Paul discussed in the salvage linear thread: if you have found yourself with a linearly arranged module, you can make it much easier to run by ripping it apart, reorganizing it to be spatial instead, temporally dislodging events etc.<br/><br/>Speaking of Harmon and D&amp;D -- and yes, I've seen/heard many of his adventures with Spencer -- the game in that first AD&amp;D community episode is so powerful not because it hits story beats but because the DM is unwaveringly sticking to the truth about the game world, no matter how unwanted the consequences. It's the players job to create the story beats, they're the storytellers, not the DM. That's what so many miss; it's up to them to hit or miss story beats as they wish. We DMs create the toys and put them in the sandbox and then the players take those toys and turn them into very interesting, satisfying stories full of twists and turn! Or, if we're <i>really</i> lucky, it becomes something much more satisfying than any story: it becomes lived experience, it becomes life.                        </div>

The classic structure of dangerous place next to safe place, dungeon next to village, wilderness next to farmlands, is a perfect setup of tools for your players to create these story beats.<br/>Think of the Harmon circle again: the top day part of and the bottom night part of it. <i>Any quest</i> hits at least some of the beats in somewhat of a right order. D&amp;D's classic structure inherently has a very satisfying hero trip.<br/><br/>LMoP has several, you go into the Cragmaw hideout and you make it out alive, changed. You go into Redbrand hideout and you make it out alive, changed. <a href="http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2008/10/picaro-and-story-of-d.html" rel="nofollow">Many small Harmon circles.</a> And the situation as a whole? One big one. We had so many deaths and we did it so out of order and the last thing we did was the, hmm, Venomfang, (trying to avoid spoilers) and it just ended in cruel failure. So awesome.<br/><br/>Like my job as DM is to be in the front row with popcorn as the players go to the dungeon to find how to make peace with their days in the dungeon. I'm the audience.                        </div>

A one-shot meant for pick-up play with total strangers at conventions and public venues? Is this meant as beginner-friendly scenario - possibly their first ever taste of D&amp;D to some of them - or a possibly nostalgia-inducing diversion for players who've already seen it all?                        </div>

                            Adam,<br/><br/>I still haven't heard what you see as the benefits of this style of prep, if you're not planning on leading the PCs through it. I'd like to hear more about what you see as the payoff here.<br/><br/>I like Dave's notes on using Story Circles as inspiration for what to prep - for example, your "spirit circle" which encloses the village being broken, otherworldly locations/realms, items or NPCs which can serve a purpose within a particular octant of the circle.<br/><br/>That allows you to prepare something Bang-like which can introduced at appropriate points in the story. With a variety of these, something more interactive could be prepared. For instance, going back to the idea of Elders, what if there were three Elders with very different ideas, and the PCs could choose to follow the guidance of one or another? All three could serve as the Mysterious Mentor (or whatever) in a specific story of the players' choosing. Instead of a set path and direction, you have at least three possible avenues to explore, and you can mix and match in play, in response to player choices.<br/><br/>I still find that, generally, the more I commit to certain ideas of plot before play, the less of a good GM I can be, but maybe it's not the same for you.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Thinking further, I could see some benefit of building in scenario elements inspired by dramatic theory like Harmon's Story Circles. For instance, if returning with a prize is supposed to show growth of the character, then the starting situation should involve some kind of problem which creates an unhappy status quo. For example, the PC is bullied by an older villager, or has never been able to pass the Test of Courage to join the Elders' circle. Another has an unrequited love; stuff like that. They're all struggling with something unhappy.<br/><br/>Building in some opportunities in the adventure for things to happen which could allow the PC to change that upon their return could be interesting. You'd have to work extra hard not to commit to those outcomes emotionally, I feel, so I'd want to come up with a few different variations - at least that way I wouldn't be committed to one particular one, but prepared for various possible outcomes.<br/><br/>But, then, how far will your prep balloon?<br/><br/>Part of the problem here is that traditional stories are usually predicated on a single hero or focal character. As soon as you switch formats to a group of characters or "adventuring party", recreating familiar story structures becomes much more challenging (and possibly even impossible).<br/><br/>It's certainly interesting to mull this over, but so many things about this line of thought give me the heebie-jeebies, just a little.                        </div>

                            The challenges I'm seeing:<br/><br/>1. What is the goal of this exercise? <br/><br/>As far as I can tell, Adam is trying to structure his prep so that the resulting gameplay stands a good chance of creating a story which fits into Harmon's Story Circle.<br/><br/>Is that right? (If not, I'm not sure.)<br/><br/>2. How do we use linear story structure to create interactive entertainment?<br/><br/>This is a huge problem, as far as I can see.<br/><br/>Any kind of prep which is based on a linear structure is (assuming an RPG setting where the PCs are free to do anything they want, random or uncertain resolution techniques exist, and so forth) tremendously problem-prone. By making "Step 2" of your prep dependent on "Step 1" being followed, played through, <i>and turning out a specific way</i>, you're making each subsequent step of your prep more and more likely to cause problems (or become irrelevant to play).<br/><br/><br/>Edit: Here's an interesting datapoint! I just bought "Pandemic: Legacy", a version of the popular boardgame which plays out over 12 "games" and, supposedly, tells a wild story along the way.<br/><br/>How does it do it? Well, I haven't seen the whole thing yet, but I can already see that it's 12 "months" (games) which you win or lose - but you get two shots at each one, and then you move on to the next one anyway. Unlike an RPG, of course, it doesn't let you do anything you want (instead, you're guaranteed to proceed though the same 12 steps), but it does have some interesting techniques built into it to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>For example, what if you just keep losing? Or keep winning? Well, the game comes with the concept of a "Budget". Your Budget helps you with resources you need for each game/epidemic. However, if you do really well, your "superiors" cut your Budget for the next game, because clearly you have things under control. If you do poorly, though, then they give you a bigger Budget for the next one.<br/><br/>This seems clever; you're more or less guaranteed to have a variety of victories and losses over the course of the 12 games. (I have a feeling that the final game is slightly rigged to make it most likely end in victory, but I don't know that for sure yet, it's just a guess.)<br/><br/>So that's an interesting example of making a linear storyline which can play out a variety of different ways. Not open-ended enough for RPG play, of course, but some variation of the concepts could be used for game design nevertheless.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Now, I'm not at all convinced that modeling adventures for an RPG (and, presumably, a group of PCs working together, instead of a single character) on Harmon Story Circles is even a good idea. Do we have any reason to presume it leads to better gaming? Perhaps, perhaps not.<br/><br/>However, were I to do it, I would look at the Story Circle structure and use it to inspire myself to prep specific material. I'll try to keep as much of Adam's ideas intact as possible, modifying as little as possible. <br/><br/>Let's look at the Circle, first:<br/><br/>* We know that there will be a return to the homestead. So, we need some problems "at home" to fix, or there will not be any Step 8.<br/>* The top and bottom of the Story Circle indicate two different realms. I need to bring in two different realms or stages of being. Adam's done this nicely with the spirit circle and the scary "outside"; it contrasts with the safety and hum-drum nature of the village and is a place where the protagonists haven't been and wouldn't normally go.<br/><br/>Now, let's look at the individual steps:<br/><br/>Step 1:<br/><br/>* This octant tells me that I need, as a basis for the characters' lives, a safe, comfortable status quo. (Adam's done that pretty clearly in his writeup, I'd say.)<br/>* I also need to establish them as the protagonists. For that, there should be a reason to pity them, it says (their lives can't be perfect, or Step 8 will never be satisfying), and there should also be some justification for them to have agency in the scenario.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I'd want to keep the writeup of the safe little village, but I'd introduce two other things - first, something that's wrong, either for each individual character, or for the group as a whole (doing "group as a whole" is tricky, but not impossible), and, second, some reason that puts them in the driver's seat.<br/><br/><i>Example</i>: <br/><br/>The country is at war. All the able-bodied, fully-grown members of the village have been sent off to the war. The PCs are those youngsters who failed the Trials of Courage, and have been left behind. (It's shameful!) As a result:<br/><br/>a) They have a negative reputation in the village, perhaps, or just can't get the respect they feel they deserve. They have a situation they have to fix or solve because of this - maybe a love interest, a profession/position they desire, or just to be considered with respect, as adults. <br/>b) There's no one else around to do "adventuring stuff"; any dangerous business will fall to them. The village will be forced to rely on them.<br/><br/>(And that's as far as I've gotten so far; I'll get back to this once I see other people's responses and thoughts on the subject.)                        </div>

I've given my answers to both, upthread -- provided we're talking about D&amp;D. Other games have other social contracts and other tools (Sorcerer, PbtA, Chuubo's, Fiasco, Dramasystem).<br/><br/>But rephrasing myself if I was unclear: Q1. Reorganize it into a keyed map &amp; rolltables<br/>Q2. The traditional meet-in-a-tavern game, or meet in a keep game. B2 Keep on the Borderlands for example. That gives players the tools they need to create a story about 1. being in a safe place, 2. wanting something (gp! Or, resolving a threat to the safe place), 3 going to a place of adventure, 4. exploring and finding their bearings, 5. getting what they came for, 6. after risking their lives, 7. they make it home, 8. and have leveled up their characters.<br/><br/>Like D&amp;D is already set up to do this. This is what I mean by seeds. You do the situation and the players create <i>a</i> story out of that. But you need to leave room for <i>them</i> to do it, it's part of what makes the experience so rewarding for them. If you try to prep it out linearly you are shooting your own foot: that's why I'm such an anti-fan of the "Five Room Dungeon" model, it dilutes beat four and so does this troll scenario.<br/><br/>I hold that the Harmon Circle should be banished from your mind during the prep stage. It turns your game into a cargo cult of D&amp;D. Instead, leave room for your players, trust them to make it cool. Let them and the gloracle turn it into whatever story guru there is: Harmon, Snyder, Campbell, Kishōtenketsu, or Arneson. Or just pancake but that can be fun too. I can't get that ice moon story out of my head; since Paul told it I've read two novels and 30 comic books <i>(the new Exiles is great)</i> but I keep returning to the ice moon story.<br/><br/>Finally, the <i>first</i> I told my group in 2014 was: "this isn't a story game. It's about entering a dangerous and beautiful world. Your hero's "story" might end with an early death on a cold, damp cave floor."<br/><br/>And I'm happy I did, we got sooo many so awesome stories out of our adventures in that world.<br/>D&amp;D is D&amp;D. Isn't that amazing? Don't give that up.                        </div>

Only if you got just one type of linear play in mind. There are at least <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/438212/#Comment_438212" rel="nofollow">three different kinds</a>. <br/><br/>In addition, if we're looking at the <a href="http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit" rel="nofollow">Story Circle</a>, and its eight points:
<blockquote><img alt="image" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/channel101/images/e/ec/DanHarmon%27s_BasicModelForStoryStructure.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090811020233"/> <img alt="image" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/channel101/images/c/c7/SS103.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090813153526"/><br/><br/>    1. A character is in a zone of comfort,<br/>    2. But they want something.<br/>    3. They enter an unfamiliar situation,<br/>    4. Adapt to it,<br/>    5. Get what they wanted,<br/>    6. Pay a heavy price for it,<br/>    7. Then return to their familiar situation,<br/>    8. Having changed.<br/><br/>1, 2, 8 belongs to a theme.<br/>3, 5, 6 belongs to an opposite theme.<br/></blockquote>
If we think of any type of scenario, when play has finished, the storyline goes like this.<br/><br/>start -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- end<br/><br/>But if you think of a scenario in this kind of way, you can start at any point. The more towards the end you start, the less chance for the players to influence the outcome.<br/><br/>LOTS OF PLAYER AGENCY<br/>history -- | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- future<br/><br/>MORE PLANNED STORYLINES<br/>history -- -- -- -- -- -- | -- -- future<br/><br/>So what can we do with this? Well, the big payout in the Hero's Journey is the clash between 1 and 8. That's when the audience comes to a conclusion based of the theme of the story. That's a huge payoff that needs special attention and preparation for it to be fulfilled. I played a lot of stories where we started at the end, and let the players realize how they ended up there, and I find it being particularly intriguing to plan the kind of stories where the players realize what the whole scenario was about. It's challenging, but doable.<br/><br/>The thing is that it's only 1 and 8 that needs to happen. The rest in between can happen in any order.<br/><br/>There is also a way of simplifying the eight steps:<br/><br/>1-2: The hook<br/>3-4: The challenge<br/>5-6: The aftermath<br/>7-8: The conclusion<br/><br/>3-6 can also be looped within themselves. The players are faced with challenges, and then the consequences of the challenges. It's just 1-2 and 7-8 that, for the entire storyline,  needs to be set in stone. How the players get there doesn't matter, but if you leave it open for how the they enter the 7th step, then they will feel that there have been player agency for them. How they leave 7 (8 is the leaving part) can also be up to them, and what they do in 7.<br/><br/>But it's the conclusion that makes and breaks it: will the players realize what all this was about?                        </div>

                            See, this is why I like you Rickard. Great post.<br/>Also I put in risks so that it's not certain that a particular PC ever returns home safely. But in my experience, the <i>players</i> get to experience the full journey. Even though there's some TPKs-followed-by-fresh-faces along the way...<br/><br/>And also maybe they don't want to return home. They have found a new home.<br/>I'm not super into over-idolizing Dan Harmon. There are other story structures that appeal to me more♥                        </div>

                            I agree with Sandra and Rickard here on two points: story structures like Harmon story circles are overrated, both because they only make sense if interpreted figuratively (which is something the group can easily do "after the fact" by making a comment about how, e.g. their character was changed by the ordeal in a short "epilogue" statement), and because we have no particular reason to think that story circle format makes for better gaming than uncertainty, player agency, or some other factor. Second, I agree with Rickard that the key to using the circle here is all about that start and finish of the "circle"; the middle part basically takes care of itself, so long as challenges are presented and overcome (although that second part is a problem if our game procedures allow for failure!).<br/><br/>I'm fully planning to get to both aspects in my hypothetical prep. Quite curious to see the results, myself!                        </div>

                            Personally, I view the Harmon story circle as a shorthand for the Hero's Journey, which itself is much more interesting than just You Need Go Search Find Take Return Change.  <br/><br/>For the middle portion to resonate, not just any "confront and overcome an obstacle" will do.  There needs to be a "belly of the whale" / "dark night of the soul" / "fall/apotheosis" element too.  There's no style of RPG prep I'm aware of that's strongly oriented toward providing that.<br/><br/>I think some of the "why bother?" reactions to Adam's example might stem from the fact that "go to the deathcrags, meet trolls, realize the actual problem is undead" might not rock the characters' worlds <i>enough</i>.<br/><br/>If instead our middle section were, "Enter the Matrix, discover that everything you ever knew was a lie, gain superpowers," then it'd be more obvious why a GM might want to plan such things out and not give the characters the option to take the blue pill.                        </div>

                            The easiest way to get real soul confrontation to really matter is for it to come from the players. That's also a giant-ass difference between film/novels/tv vs D&amp;D.                        </div>

                            Here's the thing, story is usually from the perspective of a single protagonist.  Most rpgs seem to have multiple, weak and oftentimes contradictory protagonists.  who doesn't view themselves(and their fictional character)as a protagonist at times?  This can be horrible and also magical.  Most old-school role-paying games feel like an orchestra without the sheet music.<br/>Supporting characters are in league, or at least in service to the plot/crux.  They act as temptation, and others a balm.  This dance of contrasts.  They are really powerful stuff. and they're kinda whiffed in GMless/GMfull games.  <br/>Also, hello Adam.<br/>I think rpgs can be wonderful, but story+math is a tough one.  <br/>I think one way of not railroading, and hoping to get a semblance of story would be to get rid of the conductor.  <br/><br/>I mean, with your initial set-up... if it were a story instead of a role-playing game, the characters would be friends/not-friends/enemies of this person who went missing.  Like maybe they go, or some go back after hearing this person went missing or something.  Sort of like Hamlet.  You have this character who goes back to this place, but under new circumstances.  Weird circumstances.  So you give all the players a connection to this one person, which unifies them.  Maybe some characters hate each other, which is good.  You want tension, which is another no-no when it comes to old-school D&amp;D.  Anyway, you add in some incidents with the troll.  You hint at things about these attacks that seem... familiar.  Maybe everyone gets different clues.  You reveal that this person you all know/knew became a troll, but you revel this by revealing the past.  <br/><br/>I think it's problematic having someone have the sheet music while everyone else is just guessing.  It can feel like a trick, that you need to figure out.   <br/><br/>It's this hiding of information that feels narrowing and forceful.  <br/><br/>The new Harmon circle is just four quadrants<br/><br/>The 1st one = Good / Dishonest(Lie)<br/>The 2nd one = Bad / Dishonest(Lie)<br/>The 3rd one = Bad / Honest(Truth)<br/>The 4th one = Good / Honest(Truth)<br/><br/>If you can picture the circle, the top half is Good, the bottom half  Bad.  <br/>The right side is Dishonest, the left Honest.<br/><br/>If you wanna use a monster, use the theme of a monster.  All the characters should have monstrous histories.  Things they're ashamed of.  I mean, Beowulf works because of this.  The monster is a physical manifestation of this horrible thing, somewhat intangible human thing.  This is the power of fantasy - making the hard to materialize real.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Paul,<br/><br/>You've also said I'm tying one hand behind my back by doing this. I've thought about that, and I don't see how.<br/><br/>If you mean that I have this prep that I can't use for fear of illusionism, I have that hand tied anyway. I have to work pretty hard to ignore decades of experience running illusionist games. That hand is already firmly tied.<br/><br/>I compensate by sticking to prep and avoiding pushing characters toward a specific path I'd like to see. Having an optimal plotline prepared doesn't make that harder for me.<br/><br/>Am I missing something you're saying?                        </div>

                            I also feel that a lot of your interpretations of Harmon Circles at the most basic level, like Sandra's example, miss the power of the tool. It's not enough that you go and fight stuff. You also need to cross over the threshold into the subconscious world, face your fears, let go of your baggage, and retrace your steps back in a way that echoes your journey there.<br/><br/>You can have perfectly fine games without that stuff, but having it can give games a mythological quality that I'm seeking.<br/><br/>Remember, Harmon Circles (or Hero's Journey) isn't a storytelling tool that people made up. It's analysis of mythology that resonates. If you want resonating stories, adhere to something like those cycles.                        </div>

                            My take is that, though I've had plenty of dungeon crawls that resonated in <i>some</i> way, I haven't had many that <i>really nailed</i> the Hero's Journey archetypes, at least not in a way that I could recognize.  So attempting that sounds like a fun experiment to me.<br/><br/>I'm not sure whether Adam's scenario would feel that way to me or not.  Harmon's "change a tire in the rain" thing certainly wouldn't.  Die Hard works, but I can only say that because I've seen the movie and I know that the way it's delivered really plays up the transformative nature of those stages of the path.  If I were just reading a plot summary, or letting an RPG session go wherever it went within a skeleton of the same... probably not.<br/><br/>I'll admit this is just speculation.  It's certainly possible that no RPG session is ever going to make me go, "Yeah Campbell!!!"  But I'm down to give it a shot.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Anecdote: <br/><br/>There's a phenomenon in Delve called Soft Spots, where reality breaks down and the malign Outside seeps in, causing all sort of supernatural nastiness.  Once you enter a soft spot, any symbols of magic you carry with you become more than just symbols; magic is basically "on".  Everything becomes potentially sentient and purposeful, from a twig to a tree to the sky.  Ideas, forces, and scenery elements can manifest as animals.  <br/><br/>Mostly, PCs are cautious enough to stay the hell out of these things.  The one time they went in on a mission, though, there was a kind of classic mythical vibe to the whole thing.  There was some refusing the call, some ritual preparation and sacrifice, a lot of focus on the process of crossing the threshold, a descent deeper and deeper into the unknown, the eventual finding of a key, one character losing a leg, a looming TPK threat, and finally an escape, armed with new tools they could use to fight the previously unfightable supernatural malignity.<br/><br/>I don't know if it was, like, <i>better</i> than any other scenario.  But getting to the end did have a nice epic feeling of, "Whoa," emerging from the wringer, feeling newly empowered and also exhausted and grateful to have made it.  I feel like a lot of dungeon crawls deliver that in bits and pieces, or in microcosm at a given moment, or in retrospect, but this one was pretty high on the scale of feeling it in the moment as a sort of completed arc.  (Well, sort of.  They still had to actually <i>use</i> their new tools, which became a whole other epic undertaking, so maybe we didn't complete the <i>whole</i> cycle at a recognizable pace.)<br/><br/>Anyway, my point:<br/><br/>Maybe hitting those classic Campbell notes <i>pretty literally</i> can add some value.<br/><br/>So, maybe the passage into the deathcrags should be marked by a veil or a mist or a gooey membrane... maybe the trolls should demand a show of good faith by the PCs giving up something important to them... maybe a troll shaman should bless and purify and absolve the PCs at some point for some sort of past wrongs...  Or, y'know, whatever adaptations you find suitable given your own aesthetic.<br/><br/>Not sure if that's actually in line with your goals, Adam, but I wanted to put it out there just in case.                        </div>

                            Harmon Circles are not plot arcs.<br/><br/>Harmon Circles are character arcs.<br/><br/>This cannot be stated often enough.<br/><br/>All the octants on the Harmon Circle are about <i>the character</i> and their internal and external relationship to events. Yes, we have the Inciting Incident but what is important is <i>how the character reacts</i>. Why would the character be reluctant to react? What could motivate them to react to the event to push forward out of the status quo and enter, to use Harmon's term, the Underworld.<br/><br/>You don't structure a good story by building plot beats and the characters hit them on the way through the plot--you build a good story by developing the characters and show how their reaction to events hit plot beats and make <i>each next step inevitable and logical</i>. I think John Rogers terms this the difference between "<i>because</i> x, then y" as opposed to "x, and then y, and then z".<br/><br/>I think <a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">@EmmatheExcrucian</a> 's  posts on this were really interesting in how Chuubo's kind of creates that structure to a certain degree; it at least made me interested in reading Chuubo's.<br/><br/>There are other games that also ground character change as an engine: Smallville's Statements incentivize changing your character's viewpoint and developing in response to events. And as I like to harp on, Lady Blackbird (the character) has Keys that very strongly indicated a familiar plot structure--<i>if you buy them off</i>.<br/><br/>Actually, drill down on LB a bit. In another post I pointed out that Lady Blackbird the game seems to start at Octant 3; LB has already left her status quo, entered the Underworld, and is now dealing with the new life.<br/><br/>But ALSO: the story begins at Octant 1, of course. The status quo is that LB is a noblewoman in disguise, who thinks she's better than other people, and is trying to reach Uriah. Naomi's status quo is that she hates the Empire, serves LB, and likes to fight. Cyrus is a bitter exile, firmly in command, and fascinated by LB but can't reveal it.<br/><br/>All of those can change during the game. Some of them probably should. Maybe all of them! But probably not. Just a few are enough to propel the plot engine. But what is germane here is how those character beats are built in and incentivized to change. There's an external framework to hang the story on--escape, go to Haven, go to Uriah--but also a robust <i>interior</i> framework that is where the possibility for a truly satisfying story lives. And that doesn't mean that you <i>have</i> to buy off any Keys; but think a bit about the shape of the story that might result.<br/><br/>A Lady Blackbird who never buys off her Keys could be a tragic figure. And that's a bloody interesting place to take that game.                        </div>

                            I do think there's some conflation happening here between "D&amp;D can produce a hero's journey" and "D&amp;D reliably produces a hero's journey".  I find that the latter cannot be convincingly reconciled with my experience, while I have no doubt of the former.  And I don't think that the whole "RPGs have been producing unsatisfying stories for us, so we're going to invent all new kinds of roleplaying games" movement ala The Forge speaks kindly of D&amp;D's ability to do this.<br/><br/>I tend to agree more with Adam that if you don't at least set up the dots for the players to connect if they want to, then you're at best unlikely to get something recognizable as a hero's journey type narrative.  Just going with the D&amp;D standard tropes of "There's a dungeon and it's a little ways from the safe town, so you 'cross over' when going from town to the dangerous dungeon" doesn't seem sufficient. <br/><br/>I'm not sure whether the original beats would do the job either, even assuming the players decided that that was exactly what they wanted, but I think that's because the original beats could be improved from a 'hero's journey' perspective rather than because there's anything wrong with the method, precisely.                        </div>

                            If you retooled Inspiration (for 5E specifically, though it's probably possible to do this with any sort of rigorous Fate Point-style economy) to get handed out for hitting these sorts of "character arc" beats instead of triggering from pre-determined character traits (though arguably on the individual character level I imagine what triggers a beat varies depending on the character), how effective would that be in trying to draw out the kind of story you want from the players engagement with the prep? Not every piece of prep might interact with every character at the same speed or even at all, but if your players are used to storygaming they might already know how/when to deprotagonize themselves and that's not necessarily an issue.<br/><br/>With all the talk of it lately I worry I might have just described Chuubo again though. And of course if your group is one of those that has just done away with Inspo as being irrelevant or too hard to manage, it might not be a particularly effective tool for trying to extract a specific type of play.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> Damn.  Good points.  I'd been thinking about "the character" as "the person/party experiencing these plot points".  Totally forgot about their agency in forming that experience.<br/><br/>I was thinking about making sure the characters had reasons to care about questing on behalf of the village and its elders, but I hadn't given any thought to why they might experience a trek to the deathcrags as a journey into the unconscious/magical place.<br/><br/>I wonder what'd happen if we made char-gen consist of questions aimed at each of those octants?  Like:<br/><br/>1. Why have you chosen to build a life in this village?<br/>2. How do the missing livestock troubles affect you personally?<br/>3. Why have you always avoided the spiritcircle until now?  <br/>4. Which story about the haunted deathcrags scares you most?<br/>5. Your legends tell of monstrous creatures called Trolls.  What have you always imagined you'd do if you met one?<br/>6. What is your most prized possession?<br/>7. What comforts you most about the village?<br/>8. How do you hope to one day help the village beyond your current abilities?<br/><br/>Probably not a great list, but y'know, something <i>like</i> that...                        </div>

So this is a criticism that my D&amp;D prep isn't "D&amp;D enough," essentially. That I'm being boring. It's taken me a bit of time to put aside the ouch of that criticism.<br/><br/>Once I got past it, I feel like we just run different kinds of games, and I don't mean technique-wise. I want 1st level to be pretty "small potatoes." I want to establish that the 0-XP characters are basically normal people with an untested potential to be something bigger. Leaving the safety of the village, investigating screams, parlaying with a troll family -- these are HUGE steps for these people, not tame ones.<br/><br/>Don't worry: the Towerlands setting has opportunities for planar travel and really weird stuff. I just don't want to jump right into that, because I feel like that cheapens it. <br/><br/>I feel like it's very important to establish "normal life" as a baseline. I also want to establish as part of the setting that people don't really become adventurers and go gallivanting through the wilderness; when/if the party does that, it should be a big deal, with consequences. I'm comfortable letting that transition take a couple adventures. Otherwise, I fear the players will never have an opportunity to love their village or care about it, and we'll be in murderhoboland.                        </div>

Thank you for helping me put my feelings into words. I'm struggling through all this to understand my own ideas, and you and David have been helpful in that regard.<br/><br/>I feel like I want to lay down some obvious story tracks as part of <i>sandbox prep</i>. Like, if I think about the party's arc, and if I think about each character's arc (as signaled by their backgrounds and such), then I can lay out the sandbox environment with hooks and beats that will resonate more strongly with players. <br/><br/>And I feel like the standard D&amp;D sandbox adventure often produces a pretty weak story arc by itself.                         </div>

                            Adam,<br/>There have been a couple of times where I hit this mark:<br/><br/>One was Monster of the Week. I think it worked because the premise and playsets focus the characters on the theme and the prep makes it easy to have an overal arch, but be able to improvise based on the direction the PCs take.<br/><br/>Another was Dresden RPG (the original one, not DFA). Again, the premise was pretty strong, and the Game Creation where people all made Locations, threats, etc. Kept the players and PCs focused on the supernatural story I had going on.<br/><br/>To put this advice in generic terms, make sure the players know what the game is about before they make PCs. And make the story a loose framework that you can adapt to the PCs approaches.<br/><br/>In other words, if the BBEG has a goal and tools, then you can have them respond rationally to the PCs' threats to those plans. If you have a cool set-piece battle you want to build up to, then you may be disappointed/railroad-y...<br/><br/>I hope that helps!                        </div>

Hold on. You're misunderstanding me here. That part was me replying to so many people (including you "It's not enough that you go and fight stuff" and Dave "We get coolness from the skeletons and motivated confrontation from the player characters, but we may not get 'Crossing the Threshold', 'Meet Your Maker', etc. Some would contend that those parts are desirable too.") saying that <b>my</b> various beat experiences over the years and examples given here didn't resonate, weren't mythic enough, weren't Harmon enough. And I'm like hey zoom out. What are you really saying here? Are your beats better because they were made with Harmon in mind, made as an attempt to go Harmon? Like let's not <i>dis</i> each other's beats here is what I'm saying. Like <i>don't</i> try to bring the ruckus about who's beats are the best is what I'm saying. Because I won't back down and neither will you and then it'll just end with two dorky DMs arguing over nothing.<br/><br/>Your situations <i>are</i> cool, love the semi-innocent trolls (guilty of sheep stealing innocent of people stealing) etc and the change I've been proposing over and over again have been to arrange it spatially and add more of them.<br/>And we've all been "Wow, we love the pastoral slice of life stuff" precisely because it makes you care more about the stuff you then later meet.<br/>No-one here were criticizing your beat <i>contents</i>, only the idea of hitting them in the beat <i>sequence</i>, well, until people started being like "the skeletons aren't mythic enough" on me.<br/><br/><br/>The point of my post was: 
<blockquote>In order to get resonating beats, put in resonating things. You’re job is to put in places, people, items that resonate. And it’s the player’s job to give you resonating <i>events</i>.</blockquote>
I.e. I'm saying that the Harmon circle viewed as a temporal curve, as a <i>sequence</i> of beats, is hampering you right now!<br/>While his descriptions of particular elements — the shining quarter at the bottom of the lake — can be resonant, can be inspiring for resonant beats.<br/><br/>You've already off to a very strong start with the village foibles, spirit circle etc. Just don't miss the forest for the planks.                        </div>

                            After looking at the comments and looking at your arc again, I feel like the big thing missing is a motive force for the opposition. In other words, you have events planned, but they are very dependent on having the correct circumstance.<br/><br/>What is missing is that the possession demon doesn't seem to have a goal. It doens't have any tools except the one villager that it is possessing. And there are not powers or weaknesses for the PCs to discover/exploit. In other words, this ia a great first draft, but it cannot tell a story without you, the GM, forcing it to.<br/><br/>What if the possessing demon has a motivation? Like maybe it needs to escape the village? Or maybe it needs to sacrifice the village to save its master from an even more powerful demon? Maybe it has a collaborator in town? Maybe there are some places where it is stronger and weaker?<br/><br/>Your prep needs to either assume railroad, or setup a problem for the PCs to solve and not have a pre-planned solution in mind. The best way yo accomplish this is to make the problem have a reason and direction to go, I think.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> well...sort of. But not quite there yet? Because there's still some plot hooks dug in there.<br/><br/>Like, hey, let's pull out everyone's favorite monomyth story: <i>Star Wars</i>.<br/><br/>The following is a very rough outline of things that happen around Luke Skywalker in the first half hour or so of his screen time.<br/><br/>1) His uncle buys some robots.<br/>2) Luke "accidentally" finds a message<br/>3) One of the robots runs away and Luke follows.<br/><br/>None of those plot events...really has anything to do with Luke personally or as a character, with the possible exception of the message--it seems clear that R2D2 deliberately teased him with that message to try and find out a location for Obi-Wan.<br/><br/>But if we pull stuff up via some kind of Harmon theory we get:<br/><br/>1) Luke is a farmer who is bored with his life and craves adventure.<br/>2) When some adventure arrives, however, he cares too much about his family's opinion to really do anything (his concern about R2's disappearance is basically "Uncle Owen is gonna kill me."<br/>3) Despite refusing the call, the Empire kills his family and gives him nothing to stay for.<br/><br/>But even that last point...has nothing to with anything Luke did; the Empire was tracking the droids and found them on their own initiative, not because Luke went out of his way to either hide them or tell anyone about them.<br/><br/>What is important is that as it turns out there's an old space wizard nearby who is the actual reason the droids are there, and Luke gets caught up in his story. Why? Because he really <i>does</i> want adventure, and here's an adventure! The form doesn't matter, and I suppose there might be a Dark Version where an Imperial officer arrives with an invite to the Academy and this becomes a coming-of-age story about finding your integrity. (Which actually is what the original trilogy comes down to, but that's a different discussion.)<br/><br/>You might get some more juice out of:<br/><br/>Which one of you has always wanted to see what's beyond the forest, and why?<br/>Which one of you is deathly afraid of trolls, and why?<br/>Which one of you loves this village more than your own family, and why? <br/><br/>Notice that each question has a shadow that is also interesting:<br/><br/>(Why are you not content with life in the village?)<br/>(What would make you willing/able to confront the trolls?)<br/>(How do you feel about your family?)<br/><br/>I dunno, just spitballing. But plot is character, as the screenwriters like to say <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Want to make sure that the characters will find out what's beyond the circle of stones when the trolls come calling? Make sure they play characters who want to find out what's beyond the circle of stones. Extrinsic motivations can only go so far, and are generally going to be seen as contrived.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I'm not familiar enough with 5e's character tools to give advice on using them for this kind of storytelling, however.<br/><br/>[As a sidebar, I watched the new Lost in Space show on Netflix this weekend and you can see some of this happening, even beyond the average TV show's need to have somebody carry the Idiot Ball every week. There are a LOT of natural disasters on the show, enough that I wondered if it was a subtle homage to Irwin Allen, who created the original show. Germane to this discussion, though: the disasters are used to drive character moments. But it comes off as a bit contrived, because a lot of the character motivation isn't given room to develop on its own. Putting people in a space where they fear they are about to die pushes intimacy, for sure, but it's coming from a space exterior to the character so it fails to convince as much as some kind of actually motivated character growth.]                        </div>

I totally agree! <br/><br/>The plot arc isn't where my prep ends. It's where it starts.<br/><br/>I didn't even have a demon in there until I Harmonized it (is that a thing? it is now!). They just had a poke from some trolls, but I needed a twist to liven things up and to satisfy "5. Find." The trolls being troublesome but totally reasonable people you can talk to about stealing sheep is a fun twist and sets up an ally for later on.<br/><br/>Thinking through story structure helped me add the twist and make my adventure less predictable and boring... even if none of the game goes down in the order I listed. No matter what, now I have trolls stealing sheep and serving as a red herring for the more dangerous possession demon.<br/><br/>The rest of my prep must involve giving the trolls and demon motivation, setting up locales for them, mapping the village and its vicinity, developing some NPCs including the ones who get possessed and kidnapped, and so on.<br/><br/>I'd tie the demon to some bigger ideas I have, potentially leading to more adventure later.<br/><br/><br/> </div>

That's what I said in my very first post in this big ol' thread.  <br/><br/>Now I'm just wondering how far we can take this; not just kicking Luke off on the road to adventure, but also priming him to care about what the world of Star Wars (or maybe the GM's plot?) is going to offer him.  Because this could go in a very different direction, right?  Like, if Luke's committed to the idea that The Force is trickery or heresy, he can't ride the Obi Wan discovery train.  Or if he buys Obi Wan's wisdom but hates the guy himself, we don't have that sense of sacrifice when he dies. <br/><br/>Luke isn't just (A) a bored farmer held in check by caring about his family.  He's also (B) a young, healthy, reasonably athletic, eager, naïve, big-hearted Force adept with a mysteriously deceased father who idolizes the Rebellion and hates the govt.  Without all of that, "Luke meets this corner of the Star Wars universe," would go very differently.  If I'm the GM, and this corner of Star Wars is what I've got prepped, then maybe, if my aim is to maximize Hero's Journey-ness, I could prompt the players to take char-gen all the way to (B) instead of stopping at (A)?<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>I mean, as a GM, <i>usually</i> I'm more excited by just putting a bored farmer in a dilemma and seeing whether he Lukes out or not, with "not" being a necessary (and often more interesting) possibility.  But then there are other times when I might want a "Hero's Journey or bust" option.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> Hahaha I think "ice moons" should be a new universal shorthand for unbiased sandbox (where there's no shelter from statistically unlikely disasters).  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Yeah, I definitely need to play Chuubo's.  My impression was that pure emergence is one end of the spectrum and pure scripting is the other end, and that Chuubo's is closer to the scripting end than I was hoping to go for here.  But it's hard to say for sure.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> yeah, those leading questions, that's what I was going for with my 8-part brainstorm.  Not sure what the key difference is between what I put out there and what you're proposing?  "Which story about the haunted deathcrags scares you most?"  -- my intent there was that the player would make something up, thus fleshing out the deathcrag legendry in the process.  Maybe I just didn't specify enough.<br/><br/>So, let's say we solve the problem of the characters intervening.  Once they've intervened, then what?  Where would you look to prime, say, octants 5 &amp; 6?  How do we ready John McClaine to find and embrace a new self-awareness, so different from where he started off?  In the case of both McClaine and Luke, I think it's something stemming from an initial sense of incompleteness not yet identified.  Like, something's missing, but we don't know what it is.  For Luke, you could see him yearning to matter and be part of something larger than himself.  But it's not until he finds a connection with the Force that we can go, "Aha!  That was it!"  With McClaine, I guess it's mostly that his marriage sucks and he doesn't know why, and apparently the answer has something to do with him not facing his reality enough to say he's sorry.<br/><br/>So maybe a good character question could be something like:<br/>"What hole in your life would you most want to fill if only you knew how?"<br/>"What problem in your life would you most want to solve if only you knew how?"<br/>"How would you change your place in life if only you knew how?"<br/><br/>And then maybe if the GM has a source of revelations in mind, we could tweak those toward that.<br/>For Luke: "When you dream of being a part of something greater, what do you dream of?"<br/>For McClane: "What about your life could you fix if only baggage and habit weren't holding you back?"<br/><br/>Hmm.  The first group might be too open and the second might be too on the nose...                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> I took another look at your questions, and some of yours and mine are somewhat close. I think one of the things I was trying to poke at was to put stakes in there. Like, you have a question about "how does the theft of the livestock affect you personally." That's not too bad, although it's a bit unfocused; it at least is trying to put some stakes there.<br/><br/>I'm not saying my questions were awesomesauce, but they do strongly imply some stuff happening, like "you'll take an opportunity to go beyond the forest (and I, the GM, contract to providing it)" or "You will have to face trolls in this game (and you, the player, contract to make that emotionally interesting.)" I dunno; I still feel like the central point, that plot comes from character in most versions of strong writing (and certainly strong screenwriting) isn't quite getting out there.<br/><br/>Like...really, the circles are a tool of analysis, not prescription. That is to say, you can use the circles to figure out why something isn't working ("We haven't given John strong enough stakes to want to walk across glass! Maybe we can have him talk to the cop about his issues on the radio?") and less about "Okay, then in the middle of act two we'll have to give him a realization about his marriage!" But of course, those things are all interrelated.<br/><br/>Like, I play blues a lot. On bar five of a twelve bar blues I know what I'm supposed to do (change to the IV chord--say, Bb if I'm in F, which I often am.) I know it, the audience expects it, but how well I pull that off and what melodies I bring in are at least as important. I can even play with audience expectations (Hah! Here's a diminished 7 and I'll bring it back to the IV!) because we all know what to expect. <br/><br/>Plot structures are a bit like that.<br/><br/>So you asked, what happens when the PCs interact with the story? Well...stuff changes. Their motivations and desires will interact with the events and some shape will emerge. Like, did you know that Harmon uses those circles inside <i>scenes</i>? A five minute gag between Jeff and Abed, he'll have circles for them, and for the gag itself, and also the A/B plots, and the episode itself. There's not one outside structure that imposes its shape downward--there's lots of little pressures building into a pattern.<br/><br/>I keep coming back to Lady Blackbird, but it's a really strong example of how to pull this off. You look at her sheet, and you see that we have three components to her character: she doesn't want to get married and wants to return to Uriah; she can't let anyone know her true identity; and she thinks she's better than everyone else. <i>When she interacts with plot obstacles those facets will be the pressure she faces</i>. So when they're captured by bandits on Haven and she sees that one of the bandits is still wearing House Blackbird livery, we have an opportunity to see if she is going to repudiate her Key by trying to play on his loyalties or continue on and take the lumps. <i>But either choice will be interesting</i>--if she reveals herself, she's changed as a character, and unmasked elements of the plot to the other characters. If she doesn't, then she may come into conflict with other characters (Naomi, for example) who have to suffer for her pride. And conflict will give us another opportunity to test that facet of her character!<br/><br/>That's how you drive a relatively grooved plot with character motivation.<br/><br/>As for other approaches, well, Dire Portents are a good way to think about it. You can map those to conflicts that you want to see or have set up--the character who is deathly afraid of trolls? Maybe now's the time to drop the Troll Raiding Party portent. Stuff like that.<br/><br/>What you can't do is try and hit these story points without carefully curating a lot of stuff: the characters allowed in the game, their internal conflicts and motivations, the nature of the threats. (And Adam did indicate that he was doing something like that.)<br/><br/>This is really me being the dark mirror to <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> (as I often am, Sandra!) She's saying to let people roam free in a sandbox--because then their behavior will be <i>driven by character motivation</i>. I'm saying the same thing from the opposite angle--<i>constrain the character motivation</i> so that the plot elements will flow naturally from the characters.<br/><br/>One thing I did in later sessions of The Unanswered Question was build a threat countdown a bit like you do in Monster of the Week, but use it as a kind of scene call list of stuff I wanted to see, maybe, in the session. I didn't always use everything, but I could drop that stuff in as responses to what the PCs were doing. It wasn't ideal, but I gave myself a lot more leeway with railroading in that campaign as part of the Yellow Mythos (at least for me) was about being forced into the pattern of the Play and destiny becoming an immovable force. YMMV, of course <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            "Bandit in House Blackbird livery" is pretty perfect, as it creates an obstacle to LB's goal and provides her with multiple options for addressing the situation, each favoring one aspect of her character over others.<br/><br/>I wonder if there's a usable formula in there.  I guess the obvious one is for Adam to make pre-gens tailored to his scenario.  So one character has "loves slaying monsters" and "hates starting fights" on the sheet and then Adam introduces the trolls and the player has to choose which aspect wins out.  (I know, those examples suck, but I think the logic is clear.)  But without pre-gens... I'm not sure what the ideal replacement is.  We probably want goals/aspects/keys which could come into conflict with each other, and we want opportunities for conflict which dovetail with the GM's plans.<br/><br/>Maybe we provide key/aspect lists A, B and C, with each list designed to easily conflict with the others.  Then during char-gen we ask each player to pick one from A, one from B, and one from C.  Hmm.<br/><br/>Making interesting characters first, and then prepping potential Bangs to target emergent conflicts, certainly seems way easier.  But I do like the idea of supporting a somewhat prepped plot too.  Not sure how to make those two meet...<br/><br/>"By filling out character questions, agree to make X Occurrence emotionally interesting," does seem like an appealing angle.  That's what I was aiming for with my list, but perhaps the points weren't strong enough on the "stakes" front.  I do think a shorter list of stronger character statements is probably better than a longer list of weaker ones, but I also think there's merit in thinking through how the character is oriented toward each of the 8 stages, and 8 statements did make that convenient.<br/><br/>The more I think about Luke Skywalker, the more it seems his character is tailor-made for all the big moments in Star Wars.  Would meeting Leia in the jail cell work the way it did if he weren't (in addition to the bazillion traits I listed earlier) the sort of lonely, dorky kid who'd be entranced by a hologram of a pretty lady?  Luke is just this goldmine of yearnings -- no dad, no brother, no romance, no religion, no tribe.  Now let's get you out in the universe, kid, and blow your mind with opportunities for all of those!<br/><br/>I wonder if the Land Outside Adam's Village would resonate more if it were similarly brimming with whatever the PCs lack... though not just there for the taking, obviously.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Much to ponder.<br/><br/>What are Dire Portents?  That vaguely rings a bell...<br/><br/>The threat countdown approach seems interesting.  I could often benefit from a reminder to look at my prep and maybe introduce some of it at a given moment.  Does anything in particular advance the countdown?                        </div>

                            Yeah.  It doesn't work.  It hasn't worked in however many decades old the hobby is.  I mean, if you're gonna use the same tools, the same forms, you're gonna get the same shitty results.  I use the word "worked", I mean sure it works, but there are better ways to go about getting a story, just like there are better ways to transport egg salad to a picnic.  I could use all manner of things.  I could just pour egg salad into the back seat of a car.  There are better forms.   <br/><br/>There's a lot of differences between stories and games.  Sure, there's some similarities too!  They're just different animals.  <br/><br/>Stories make mountains out of molehills.  Games do the opposite.  <br/>Facts try and tightrope that middle ground that exists between the two.                          </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> Dire Portents are the countdown elements Dungeon World uses for its Fronts. Basically the countdown clock from AW you're supposed to do for each Front; I just like Dire Portents better <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> (Pulling out a Dire Portent can be a really effective GM move as well on a 6-).<br/><br/>You could maybe dodge the pregen angle by making a list of really leading questions and letting the players claim them. Like, instead of "How has the theft of livestock affected you?" maybe "Who in your family will starve if you don't stop the livestock theft?" But then, claiming or being randomly assigned questions seems to be a design pattern I'm using a lot lately, my last three games have some kind of Q&amp;A portion. Hrm....come to think of it, a questionnaire about the town and its elders could also maybe be productive, depending on the game; like the one I made for Rovers where you answer questions about just what kind of Empire your space opera has.<br/><br/>It's no accident Luke is supremely well-fitted for his story <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> but you still kinda have it backwards there. Luke has those kinds of adventures <i>because</i> his character is exactly what you said it was, yearning, rootless, and headstrong. Plot is character! There's a reason screenwriters mutter that in their sleep. Lady Blackbird likewise works because LB is the walking Plot Device (John Harper described her as such) so her Keys all point to the basic story outline and she will probably have plenty of chances to buy them off. Whether she buys them off or she sticks to them, however, they will push the story into its predicted form for the most part. There's a reason John Harper's games are so genius, after all <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I will note in passing that Keys would be another way to rig this kind of thing up. Doesn't D&amp;D 5 have something like that? I'm pretty rusty on it but there's some kind of Beliefs system that feeds Advantage or XP, right? That's another angle of attack.                        </div>

                            +1 <br/>Lady Blackbird is super clear about this. With "outside" pointing goals and "inside" (possibly antagonistic) party bonds, you get what I call a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIDUGZpaSHo" rel="nofollow">Labyrinth cleaner</a> (1:50). Asking questions is no more ethical than railroading, and much easier. What's not to like in it ?<br/><br/>You can begin with a map and question-create the characters from there. <br/><br/>If I need a map for a mystery (and it seems there is one here), I start with a <a href="https://onmightythews.com/" rel="nofollow">Mighty thews</a> map, and make it a <a href="https://wiki.fisktank.nu/doku.php/fishtank" rel="nofollow">Fishtank</a>. There are many ways to refine this, with the map for all to see still being a mystery and all. Sandbox play breaks that game, though.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Is it me or so far it looks like pure railroading doesn't have too much to offer anymore? I mean, you can do lots of prep and stablish some starting limits for the players but otherwise leave them room enough to make their own decisions, make the chance for character death a real one without provoking frustration or stopping the dramatic development of the story, and then let players come up with their own interpretation of the story theme.<br/><br/>For all the rest you can trust story-game tools to help players make really great material, the sort that a single mind can't think of but a group can build up to make it better.                        </div>

                            Adam, even for that there's a better technique in the Mountain Witch. To make it even less illusionistic you can agree to the players that "whatever they say can be used against them". I made this part of our group's social contract and, though we started playing using railroading and illusionism now we're using so many of these tools openly that I doubt we could call our particular playstyle illusionistic or railroady anymore.<br/><br/>Well, at least I'd need to scratch it deeper to call it so. I'm pretty sure there are still some illusionism practices ingrained there that we're used to, along with an interiorized social contract that allow us to enjoy the game and not care anymore.                        </div>

                            Add "appropiating other's ideas and outright lying to them" and then it would fit into my definition of illusionism. But I'll give it that that's just my definition and a really opinionated one, which I'm trying to change a bit.<br/><br/>My personal opinion aside, I'm not sure. I mean, the effect won't change in any case, either if the GM comes up with it or even if somebody makes the rest think it was their idea. If the illusion isn't discovered, is it an illusion?<br/><br/>Does switching your prep at the last moment really makes an illusion? Actually, it just changes the time frame the world was created and you commited to it as a GM. You could have changed your idea right before the game or five minutes after making the prep the past week, does changing your mind makes it an illusion?<br/><br/>That's why no clear answer comes into what's illusionism for me until we talk about "appropiating other's ideas and outright lying to them" and other similar dishonest stuff that actually ruin the game and thus has come to define Illusionism as a problematic procedure. It shows in the GM commitment to the changes he made after he introduced them to the fictional world, and in in the recognition he fails to give to the actual authors of those great world changes. That's when everybody can tell "that was an illusion" and feel cheated for it.<br/><br/>But then take the Mountain Witch trick: by just asking openly to the players about their expectatives and stating from the start of the game that this is a valid technique the GM will use, everyone's authorship is protected. The GM isn't actually creating any illusion there. She's commiting to the player's expectations and improvising material from there, so it's not even like betraying a prep that wasn't there to begin with.                        </div>

                            I don't think pure railroading has anything to offer the sort of play we're talking about here.  But there are other sorts.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think the utility of hiding the GM's process really depends on the players' preferred relationship to the nuts and bolts of play.  Some want complete transparency, while others want the most robust illusion they can get.
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DeReel" rel="nofollow">DeReel</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>With "outside" pointing goals and "inside" (possibly antagonistic) party bonds</p></div></blockquote>This does seem like a useful dynamic.  In this thread, we haven't discussed much how the "group of protagonist" story differs from the "solo protagonist" story.  You couldn't have Die Hard with 5 John McClaines.  Instead you could have something like The Avengers, where your heroes are providing some of the conflict for each other.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure how best to think of that.  In an adventuring party RPG, do we have 5 overlapping Hero's Journeys, or do we have one, with the usual internal struggles externalized into party debate?<br/><br/>In Primetime Adventurers or Sorcerer, with their separate protagonists, I think the desired answer is "multiple Journeys".  <br/><br/>In D&amp;D, though...?  If plot is character, do we have 5 plots, or is the character the party?  Over the arc of a campaign, I'd say we have multiple character arcs, but over the course of one adventure, I think the "party as character" model might be a better fit.  Hmm...
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"Who in your family will starve if you don't stop the livestock theft?"</p></div></blockquote>Gotcha, I see what you're saying about stakes in these questions.<br/><br/>"If you do nothing, bad stuff happens," does seem to be an important base to cover.  Sometimes it's just so players take action rather than planning/debating, but I think there's also a nice element of pressuring them into dramatic choices.  In the right situation, those choices will probably cross them from one octant into another.<br/><br/>On that topic, thanks for the note on Dire Portents!
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>claiming or being randomly assigned questions seems to be a design pattern I'm using a lot lately</p></div></blockquote>I dig it!  Strikes me as a good compromise, a way to make characters who fit without going all the way to pre-gens.  <br/><br/>I wonder if such scenario-tailored questions could work with existing characters.  Like, say Adam's group befriends the trolls and vanquishes the possessor and then they still want to play those characters some more.  Do we have the option to create a new scenario and flesh the characters out to fit into it?  Or is that completely insane, and we need to let the next scenario emerge from what we already know about the characters?
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Luke has those kinds of adventures <i>because</i> his character is exactly what you said it was, yearning, rootless, and headstrong.</p></div></blockquote>Well, within the fictional reality of Star Wars, yes, of course!  The causality starts with Luke.  For the writer, producer, director, or GM of Star Wars, though... maybe, maybe not.  Whether or not "start with a desire to show some kid the magical path to defeating galactic evil, then invent the right kid" is a reasonable creative approach anywhere else, I think we've agreed that in GM prep it's an option...<br/><br/>(FWIW, I <i>do</i> think it's reasonable elsewhere, and that you can manhandle a character any way you want in the conception stage; it's only after they're full realized and the story is being written for real that you have to let them drive.  Works for me, anyway.)
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>LB is the walking Plot Device (John Harper described her as such) so her Keys all point to the basic story outline and she will probably have plenty of chances to buy them off.</p></div></blockquote>Yeah, there is something nice about the gameplay incentive in Keys: earn for changing, earn for staying the same, but don't earn for not even bringing it up.  It's great for the player, and for GM prep it's a great way to highlight what the story/scenario will/could/should test.  <br/><br/>LB's physical journey to Uriah is the vehicle for all the other characters to deal with their own personal journeys, as loyalties are strained and risks/costs evaluated.  Since we <i>know</i> that they will at least <i>try</i> to escape the govt, navigate past some interesting stuff, and get to the pirate outlands, we can build the other characters with Keys relevant to that journey.  I think Fall of Magic gets great mileage out of a similar set-up, like, "This character is definitely going on this journey, and you are here to participate in that."<br/><br/>In an adventuring party game, I wonder if one PC could serve that role per scenario.  Like, in Scenario 1, it's Character 1's family member who is abducted; in Scenario 2, it's Character 2's land which is infected by the encroaching plague; etc.  Knowing the party's basic direction, the GM can then be sure to fill it with stuff that's likely to test all the characters' Keys.  Or, y'know, make sure the characters have Keys that are relevant to what the GM wants to confront them with.<br/><br/>If I'd already played a session in a game where Keys exist and change, and the GM threw out a pile of new Keys prior to the next session and said, "Who wants which?  Choose one to replace one of your old ones!  Then explain what's changed since last we assembled!" I think I'd dig that.                        </div>

                            With multiple main characters, realistically the way to do things is that they each have their own arcs, and those arcs are interwoven and connected, just like in a novel or movie or tv series with multiple protagonists. Everyone has their own thing going on, but those things are related, or at least have cross-over in experience <br/>For an example from my own play, while Sadie isn't directly involved when Sora fights and kills the King of Monsters and then falls into a depression because she loved him, Sadie is there watching the fight, and cheering Sora on, and then comforting her when she's depressed about what happened, because Sadie and Sora are dating, so of course Sadie is going to take care of her depressed girlfriend.<br/>That sort of thing. <br/>Each character having their own arc, but then those arcs being connected and other main characters being very much involved in what's happening to their friends, whether physically or emotionally.                         </div>

                            Yeah; I was going to say something very similar to what Emma said: While it's important that each PC have "their own thing(s) going on" it's also important that the PCs be linked in such a way that what affects one of them affects all of them in some related way (related in the sense that it's probably NOT helpful for a D&amp;D-type game for one PC to suffer for something and another to benefit.)                        </div>

                            I actually haven't played many "party" RPGs recently!  I just think Adam's situation presents an interesting challenge.<br/><br/>It's funny, I've only been thinking of "prepared plot" as something for a party, because I'm familiar with where there's still meaningful player agency there.  Preparing individual character plots sounds a little scary on that front.  (Unless the GM plots get the up-front buy-in that Chuubo's plots get, and then in play the focus is on acting...  But I dunno, as a player I like to <i>discover</i> a good GM plot.)<br/><br/>Given the points made in this thread about plot/character/Harmonstuff, however, maybe if the GM wants to prepare a "Hero's Journey" experience for 5 players, they need... 5 plots?<br/><br/>Hopefully not.  Hopefully overlapping connections will suffice -- tying the PCs to each other, tying them all to the locations, NPCs, and events the GM has planned, etc.<br/><br/>Still, the reason I'm interested in this topic in the first place is the premise that, for the right group/game, there is something to be gained from some GM pre-authoring.  So I don't want to lose that in the process of roping in all these good emergent-story tools.                        </div>

                            I'm working on an approach that may help, though it's a bit PvP.<br/><br/>-The GM preps a list of strong principles/priorities for the PCs to act upon. These must scream Conflict to work properly. Like "I'll help/collaborate with anyone but my family interests will always go first" or "Knowledge is first and last (over the needs or rights of anyone)". Not all of them need to imlpy anything that evil or unethic; legal good-like principles will work here too: "I'll never let evil prevail", "I'll always protect people in need".  The thing is to have a bunch of principles that would make characters with strong, well defined personalities, characters that will have priorities and do some things that will create deep, significative conflict.<br/><br/>-Beyond these, players are free to go as they please, make up their own goals and decide their own course of action. I'd never try to force a party status to the players in this case, as they will naturally develop their own plots, separate and get together later, giving shape to a intertwined story. Also, Let players come up and handle NPCs and even creatures present in scenes whenever their PCs aren't present, as long as the GM defines their goals and resources.<br/><br/>-The GM also preps the start of each scene: who's there and what creates the conflict here, what are the skills, tricks, plans and resources of the opposition, what's being threatened and how does it relate with the PCs. She preps no solutions, no answers, not a single way to solve the conflict, just creates the place and situation to make sense. A twist may also be prepped just in case things stall, but it must be made in a way that doesn't depend on the PCs doing something specific before the twist.<br/><br/>-The Emotional Matrix from Tenra Bansho does wonders here too: it gives an emotional vibe to the players that they can work with but not necessarily to react to immediately. As a result, the plot takes unexpected and really interesting twists and turns without GM intervention.<br/><br/>Then it becomes the work of the GM to help set the proper mood, add fuel to whatever the PCs want to do, give everyone opportunity to develop their own arc and focus the story around the best material. Theme and approach comes as a byproduct that the GM can make more present in the epilogue scene, after everyone has spot it appear during the game. Players often collaborate and make it stronger if the GM shows them how.                        </div>

                            Yes, but faster. Here players are meant to have clear goals at the start of the game, even if these just get them to the first scene. Then the mechanics make the fiction show their teeth and the players get in trouble by trying to react and take control of it while keeping faithful to the principle they chose to begin with.<br/><br/>I'm reading the design notes from Anno Daemonum and it seems that lots of the scenes there begin with exploration. Also, it's a lot more reliant on social interaction, which doesn't have to be the case on the approach I mentioned. After all Sandra is using it for non PvP D&amp;D. Also, it isn't like the pressure to do things must be evil in nature. A PC with good intentions may create lots of conflict too if they are unwilling to let some things be, if they can't stand grey areas and if they have a precise idea of how things should be amd the will to meddle to make them that way.                        </div>

                            Yeah, if our goal is to help the GM's plot points actually matter to the characters, then I see how creating characters with strong priorities would help.  <br/><br/>For this thread's exercise, though, if I had to pick between general statements like "I always protect people in need" and plot-tailored statements like "I fear I may go mad if I enter the Deathcrags", I'd go with the latter.  <br/><br/>Maybe the ideal is some combo of both, though?  Like how Lady Blackbird's keys mix specific goals that'll provoke conflict ("get to dangerous guy in dangerous place") with personality traits that'll do the same ("looks down on others").                        </div>

                            Two new thoughts:<br/><br/>1) Design 7 dungeons, each one aimed at optimizing its chances of providing an experience which maps to a specific step on the Hero's Journey.  Assign the dungeons level ratings in the desired sequence.<br/><br/>2) GM prep bangs (events the PCs must deal with) aimed at spurring them toward specific steps on the Hero's Journey.  Each time the GM judges that the PCs have reached a step, they move onto their bangs for the next step.  This judgment concerns where the PCs are at internally, how far they've come on their personal journeys, and thus might be more relevant than all the external stuff discussed to date.                        </div>

                            Aware/unaware, I could see either way.  Personally, as a player, I wouldn't want to be aware of "you're on Step 3 now which is called X".  It'd be more fun for me to just play my character.<br/><br/>I think the pitch for the game would have to reference, if not The Hero's Journey, some sort of arc of character change.  So no one should be playing characters who they just want to stay the same and not venture outside of who they are at the beginning.<br/><br/>I think whenever the character made what felt like a relevant step on their personal journey, the GM would have to judge where that leaves them, and what it sets them up for.  The Hero's Journey would be the GM's target to shoot for, with the understanding that it may not happen in any tidy fashion.  So maybe you skip Step 2 or spend a long time in various permutations of Step 4 or whatnot, but the GM still has a rationale for bang-prep.<br/><br/>My guess is that one needn't achieve perfection to get something out of this.

                            Interesting! Good answers; I will ponder.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it seems like a "light" GM-inspiration tool, which is never a bad thing: "Hey, try to riff off the idea of the 'refusal of the call' when you brainstorm your next dungeon/encounter/Bang."<br/><br/>How much impact it will have on a given game depends quite a bit on the person, case-by-case, I think, as well as the participants and their decisions. I could see this delivering a Hero's Journey narrative, or I could see it just being a bit of a creative constraint which helps the GM come up with something but then quickly gets discarded, equally.                        </div>

                            Yeah.<br/><br/>With single-character play (or at least one character at a time), I could see it possibly going all Hero's Journey.  With an adventuring party, probably not.                        </div>

                            Is there any reason that the rest of the characters can't take a step back and just be supporting characters while someone else is hitting their story beat? Or to weave different characters "journeys" together in different places? Wasn't the "Story Circles" thread from some months ago heading down this same path of discussion, at one point?<br/><br/>I can certainly seeing it get jumbled and convoluted, and having to cycle between different characters might leave certain stories hanging to the point where they lose impact even if they do hit all the steps...<br/><br/>A big part of getting the most out of it in a group might hinge on that age-old RPG problem of "Why are we a party in the first place?" If you can come up with a justifiable reason why the characters are undergoing all these personally life-changing things at the same time, you can get a lot of double-duty out of certain story beats; I suspect it would be a worthwhile goal to attempt, anyway, trying to strike that balance between shared/individual goals and growth (and if you're really committed to it, I think it can make it even that more striking from the perspective of serious, dramatic play, when the disparity between individual characters' journeys starts to become an issue).                        </div>

                            I would definitely like to see more RPGs which follow the model of older stories, in which one "hero" goes through a familiar story/character arc, while being helped by a number of companions.<br/><br/>This puts one player in a preferential position, but it could be a really powerful storytelling model. It could even help facilitate some of the steps (for instance, when it comes to the Refusal of the Call, the hero could do so, until one of the companions convinces her otherwise, gets in trouble and needs to be rescued, or some such).<br/><br/>Basically, it would end up looking like Star Wars or the Lord of the Rings or some such - one character is clearly the hero, but embedded in a "party" of companions.                        </div>

                            Primetime Adventures could be a good model for this.  Over time, every character gets a turn in the spotlight, but for any given session (I think?) there's one primary protagonist.<br/><br/>Shouldn't be hard to tweak the scale, there.  The companions in the party will get their own arcs in time.

If it works, great!<br/><br/>My main concern with a "party" game is giving each character room to process things authentically and take those Journey steps when it's right for them.                        </div>

                            Ten Candles and Lovecraftesque are especially good at creating tragic storylines, starting with long and slow worldbuilding scenes, and gradually increasing pace to a sudden realization &amp; a final descend into death/madness. Their procedures are very different but both create a similar 'track' so to speak. And its not just about horror! The works of Yukyo Mishima often use the same arc and I think they could be used for any tales about tormented people and inevitable doom.<br/><br/>I would love to see other games which outline different type of stories!                        </div>
