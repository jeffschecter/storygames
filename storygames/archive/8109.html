Here's the idea, which is for my slowly developing intrigue game in the Swedish 1700s:<br/><br/>Oracles is an awesome method for making interesting situations. However, Oracles are prepwork, albeit participatory prep. It takes a lot of time before actual play begins. Also, when the story begins, all the buildup is done in prep, and play tends to get to the conflicts right away. For my game, I really want to keep that buildup in play. So here's what I'm thinking:<br/><br/>Players can set up scenes that introduce characters, relationships, and goals. These scenes are quite short, and don't use any mechanics. A player frames the scene and hands out temporary character ownership. Conflicts can and should be introduced, but cannot resolved. The rules are there as an aid to creativity and to ensure that the situation develops into an interesting one, with good tensions and conflicts to build the rest of play on. After enough characters, conflicts, relationships and goals have been introduced (someone will need to make a relationship map during this stage), play pauses, players pick their characters and stat them. Then regular play starts, conflicts get resolved, and all that tension gets used and built upon. Blam!<br/><br/>I see two main advantages with this method. First of all, play starts at once. There's no chargen or brainstorming or anything, you just sit down and say "Who's got a good idea for a scene?". Second, it ensures that there's a nice buildup in the story, without people needing to worry about "play not going anywhere". And everything is introduced in the fiction, and not just at the table, which is nice.<br/><br/>What do you guys think? What dangers set off your spidey-senses? What thing will be crucial to get right to make sure it yields reliably awesome situations?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178638/#Comment_178638" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-14T04:34:02+00:00" title="November 14, 2008  4:34AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm doing something similar with Fiasco, although in a clear pre-play step.  As a big proponent of creative constraints, I think immediately jumping into scenes that establish relationships and details about the situation is going to introduce a lot of variables related to the players.  Their level of engagement, skill, and motivation are all going to be big factors in determining whether you get a really compelling situation or something weak, lopsided, or confusing.  I know this is a universal constant to some degree, but my feeling is that by offering nothing in the way of structure up front, you are handicapping the process.<br/><br/>What I've learned in my Fiasco playtests (and play of other situation-generating games) is that the generative piece <i>is </i>play - just a different kind of play.  Make it fun and compelling and it isn't a burden at all.<br/><br/>Constructively, to make your idea work I'd suggest a lot of support in the form of good examples, advice on what constitutes "enough", strategies for working collaboratively, and stuff like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178647/#Comment_178647" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-14T05:34:35+00:00" title="November 14, 2008  5:34AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I said above, "The rules are there as an aid to creativity and to ensure that the situation develops into an interesting one, with good tensions and conflicts to build the rest of play on." The idea is that it's not a big freeforming mess, but rather a sort of recipe, or maybe something with checkboxes (you need at least four out of these seven types of relationships), or ... I don't know. but there will definately be rules (I realise now that "don't use any mechanics" was a bad way of putting it. That should read "don't use any resolution mechanics").<br/><br/>There could well be something like the relationship recipe thingies that flourished a year or two ago. Remember those? They were like: "Add a person who loves someone. Add another person who stands to lose a lot if the lovers get together. Add another person who is a friend of both of them." And so on. They were cool. Maybe I could do something like that. Point is, it won't be without any constraints at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178657/#Comment_178657" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-14T06:10:17+00:00" title="November 14, 2008  6:10AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry if I misread your intent, Simon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178665/#Comment_178665" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-14T06:29:18+00:00" title="November 14, 2008  6:29AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No worries; I was being unclear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178695/#Comment_178695" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-14T09:24:24+00:00" title="November 14, 2008  9:24AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's neat, Simon.<br/><br/>So, my game <b>A Taste For Murder</b> is basically a big relationship map, OK? In an early draft, you'd build that relationship map in play, with scenes that establish relationships: they'd be things like "X is blackmailing Y". In the game, you'd make the relationships <i>worse</i>, step-by-step: "X is blackmailing Y" would become "X was threatening to tell Y's wife".<br/><br/>So I basically think your game would work pretty well as it is. In a scene, I could establish a goal for my character or a relationship with another character. When we'd all got, say, two goals, and a relationship with every other character, we'd start doing conflicts based around the relationships.<br/><br/>I think it's rather good.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
