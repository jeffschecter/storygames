                    [Cross-posted from ye olde blogge]:<br/><br/>Well, I don't have one yet.<br/><br/>But I've been toying with the idea of firing up a contest along the lines of Game Chef or Reverse/Engineer here on good ol' Elsewhere.  I admire both of those contests, and the work of the folks that enter them - there's a great deal of creativity that goes into not only the entries, but the contests themselves.  I think that they're quintessential for the hobby - they're fora where the limits get pushed, again and again.<br/><br/>I have the will (and more importantly, abundant time) to dedicate to a contest.<br/><br/>So I've been rolling the idea around since I heard about Rev/Eng and saw the response that it got - I realized that folks can and do enjoy an interesting contest that isn't Game Chef - and that you can have one of these more than once a year.  I've decided to start putting one together, and I'm going to take a leaf from both of those contests and lay out a rubric and get a site up ahead of time (it'll be a h@xx0rd Wordpress blog where anyone can register and upload, actually), and get the drumbeat going ahead of time.<br/><br/>At the moment, the idea plays into one of the on-going themes here at Elsewhere: Design a role-playing game that incorporates other gameforms.  An RPG that uses cards, a gameboard, some online (or programmatic) component, a toy ... in short, an RPG that isn't just the Holy Trinity of book, dice and character sheet. <br/><br/>RPGs with moving parts and interactive bits.<br/><br/>I have no idea what to call it.  I'm playing with 'The Mix-O-Tronic Challenge', after my beloved invention.<br/><br/>Comments and suggestions welcome, as always.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>My question to the SG Community is: What do you think is the appropriate length of time to wait after Rev/Eng finishes to allow for maximum participation?  I don't want to step on Kevin's toes, and I don't want folks to be burnt out on contests, either.                </div>

                            Cool man.<br/><br/>I think that you have a while....we still have the second round of voting for rev/eng, and then we'll be into late october. I was pondering a challenge-y thing and thinking that the holidays might be a good time (maybe kick it off right before Thanksgiving), mainly because people have breaks and vacations and stuff. Even Thanksgiving may be a little close, mid-December might be a good time. This is all just pulling thoughts out of my ass, tho.                        </div>

                            Yeah, what Nathan said.  Timing these things can be weird, especially when we haven't finished the last one.  If you want to plan for maximum impact, maximum participation, waiting at least another month would be well advised.<br/><br/>That said, I think it's clear that the annual Game Chef isn't the be-all and end-all of design contests now.  It's still hip and cool, as the oldest incarnation of this thing, but that model is not the only way to go.  I would also argue to that the way the time limit component was handled last year (no offense meant, Andy, of course) made for some awkwardness.  I honestly think it would be better for Game Chef to stay pretty basic (3 components and a theme) and let other contests deal with fiddley special rules and things that have to be incorperated.<br/><br/>So yeah, power to ya.<br/><br/>P.S. Part of me is still kinda annoyed that Ron said "Only one Game Chef event a year" and then started the Ronnies.  There is something to be said about avoiding everybody sponsoring their own design contest.  Shreyas had 4 people submit to "lesbianstripperninja" in Jan and no one (including myself) finished a dolphin game for "Summer Fun Game Chef."  Too many contests spoils the sense of community.                        </div>

                            My first reaction is a wet blanket, "Well, we can't have too many..." but you know what?  Bollocks.  Bring em on. Some will fail, sure; some will have a handful of participants and not reoccur.  Others, though, will strike a chord and get participants and happen the next year.  I don't see a big problem with this.  I mean, even if you do a contest and get very few participants, what are you out?  A little time, and a very little bit of judging?  These things only get onerous when there's a tidal wave of participants.                        </div>

                            Granted that the successful contests bring 60+ entries each time, it can't hurt to spread out the love.  But...

Dammit!  Is nothing sacred?  You try to work on something you think is a little different, but it seems like every part of my spy game idea is popping up like mushrooms.  Espionage game?  In droves, including one by Ron Edwards.  Now the board element is not only an "on-going theme here at Elsewhere" but the potential subject of an upcoming competition.

True, I agree. Aim for a time when other major creation projects aren't going on. That said, there's going to be a Mini Game Chef towards the end of the year (Last October/November), very easy very cheesy, without the huge amount of regular peer feedback and the like. It's more accurate to say that it's closer to a 24 Hour RPG, just spread out of a week.  However, I don't expect a lot of participation, so I see no problem even once you getting organized if you want to drop an advert in the 24 Hour RPG or Game Chef mailing lists...
<blockquote>I would also argue to that the way the time limit component was handled last year (no offense meant, Andy, of course) made for some awkwardness.</blockquote>
BITCH!  Don't make me NetSpank you! :-)<br/><br/>Seriously, this last year's was a total experiment in pushing the limits, as I've said over on the Game Chef list and the like. We totally trod in hippieville to see what happened. I did notice that some past submitters didn't participate, which was totally cool... and yet, even though we were in filthy weirdville, we still had 60+ submitted games. I seriously shudder when I think about what's going to happen next year in terms of scale.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Sorry.  I understand your woes, though.  The first idea that my horrible wandering eye has been able to settle on and work through is, of all things, a zombie game.  Which is something that, like, a half-dozen other people are doing right now.<br/><br/>Such is life.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I wanted to get the infrastructure up and running first, and to really try to nail the procedures to the wall, so waiting isn't that big a deal for me anyways.  I'm not too worried about participation - if there are 10 games that come out of it, I'd be happy.                        </div>

Was there post-Chef discussion this year like there was last year (I was graduating and kinda fell off the face of the earth for the later part of the competition)? Cuz, personally, I didn't dig the time requirement thing (aka where the limit got pushed to) a'tall. Which can be a topic for a different thread, or email, or whatever.                        </div>

When registering and in all correspondence, the contestants will use an original pseudonym.<br/>3. Each contestant gets one (1) randomly assigned set of four (4) terms, fresh from the Mix-O-Tronic.<br/>4. Each contestant must then choose three (3) 'game pieces' from either board or card games.  No two (2) piece types can come from the same game.<br/><br/>Examples: chess board/pieces, checkers, mancala board/beads, Carcassone pieces, wargame chits, Catan buildings/roads, dungeon tiles, 3d constructible houses/ships, Monopoly board/houses/Chance/Community Chest cards.<br/><br/>The pieces must be specific to one game (for example, the contestant can't use 'any wargame chits', but must use 'SPI Terrible Swift Sword' chits).<br/><br/>(I'm considering making an 'official list', but I'm not sure yet.)<br/><br/>5. The game produced from the above must be recognizable as an RPG, per the Game Chef 'intuitive' criteria.<br/>6. Two (2) weeks are given for the design of the game.<br/>7. At the end of the two weeks, each game is submitted at random to four entrants (and/or judges), who will rank each game in a 'run off' fashion for several criteria (to be determined).<br/>8. Two (2) weeks are given for judging.<br/>9. The results are tabluated, with higher scores in primary criteria breaking ties.<br/>10. Winner announced.<br/>11.
