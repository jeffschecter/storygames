I guess I don't understand it very well. Anybody?<br/></blockquote>\nFrom what I understand, the new OGL is fairly restrictive and hinges on two major things:<br/><br/>1) The DnD 4e Players Handbook must be the basis for play in any product that participates in the 4e OGL.  That means in order for your game to be under the 4e OGL, you have to reference (but not copy/plagiarize) all the new rules for Fourth Edition Dungeons and Dragons.  Scif-fi, Horror, Cyberpunk, whatever is out unless it is directly compatible with the PHB4e<br/><br/>2) Your game/product must say on it somwhere other than the front cover that it is compatible with Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition.  WotC will develope some boilerplate, procedure, or symbol that publishers will indicate the fact.<br/><br/>If your game/product does not meet both of those criteria, you're not under the guidelines of the 4eOGL.  Which means 1 of three things:<br/><br/>1- You are in violation of the OGL and may be subject to legal action<br/><br/>2- You are using a 3.0 or 3.5 OGL and your product has nothing to do with DnD 4e<br/><br/>3- You are completely making up your own content and are disassociated with DnD/D20 altogether<br/><br/>Now, that's the best I understand it so far.  I could be completely wrong.  My guess as to the reasoning for all of this is to encourage and forster the boom that followed the initial D20 OGL release without the devastating bust that game soon after that.  WotC is trying to manage the growth of DnD compatible products rather than letting it spiral out of control.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118541/#Comment_118541" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T11:43:27+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 11:43AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2008 1:34PM by Ry.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Troy, what's your source on your criteria?  <br/><br/><b>Edit: It's Morrus (from EN World) transcribing Scott Rouse.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118552/#Comment_118552" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T12:11:32+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 12:11PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I'm curious how they can restrict, by date, the creation and publication of OGL stuff.

I'm not an IP lawyer, so I don't know, but the text of the OGL license belongs to WotC, so presumably they can restrict its distribution, and in that case, they can effectively limit you from producing OGL products by forbidding you to distribute the text of the OGL license (as you'd have to do) inside your product.<br/><br/>Given the widespread intention they've already established for free dissemination of this license, I suspect that point would get defeated if it came to legal action, but there's nothing to stop WotC from sending out a cease and desist order to a publisher and trying to get an injunction against them, is there?<br/><br/>I suspect that what we have here is a bifurcation not unlike the old GNU Emacs/XEmacs software split. A bunch of publishers will presumably decided that they like the OLD SRD/OGL structure very nicely, thank-you (i.e. Green Ronin with True20/M&amp;M, Crafty Games with Spycraft) and don't need to sign on to the spanky new system. Those who want to produce material compatible with 4e (Paizo?) may well decided to embrace the times and move their products along. And we'll have two big streams of slightly compatible stuff moving forward; presumably, with one being "mostly fantasy" in tone, and the other being "other stuff" in tone.<br/><br/>Just a thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118562/#Comment_118562" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T12:27:53+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 12:27PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my guess at the logic of this all...<br/><br/>First, they know that for traditional rpg publishing, the big wave is the initial release.  So first, they don't want anyone releasing 4E material before they do.  Second, anything can be pirated- they probably also want to make sure not some random pirate is going to drop the SRD on P2P months before release.   Third, they're also figuring that if anyone else is going to ride their initial wave- they're taking their share of it.<br/><br/>If we think more cutthroat, you could also say that the businesses who could afford to cough up $5K, probably aren't -well- in the position to cough up $5K- it means they'd have to invest heavily and push it heavily.

That is, you promised not to just put out a PHB with the serial no's filed off, and by making this promise you got access to the licensee community of IP and usage of the D20 branding. As the worth of that brand diluted, more and more publishers moved to operation solely under the (less restrictive) OGL licensing scheme and, no doubt, this whole move on WotC's part is (in part) a reaction against that general drift and an attempt to reassert their control over the central IP/brand at stake here.<br/><br/>But that's just my (potentially very) naive understanding of the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118571/#Comment_118571" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T12:48:07+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 12:48PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess if you were a big second tier company that planned on churning out many, many products at a competitive advantage, five grand wouldn't be such a big deal.

But I also suspect that they don't really regard the 5K as a source of revenue at all (since after June, who's going to pay it?), and that it's really only meant as a barrier to entry. And really, in that light, it's a double-barrier to entry, because now only companies with significant financial resources, <i>and</i> significant staffing resources, are going to consider this a good

The $5K in this instance would get no different tax treatment as rooms and meals during Gencon (I guess there's an argument that you might have to capitalize the expense as an asset on your balance sheet and then write it off over the economic life of the product or something stupid, but I doubt it). <br/><br/>Is there a good business case for spending $5K today for something you get for free in six months? Maybe if you were caught flat footed by the 4e announcement and it derailed a major 3e release you had in the works. If you were desperate to port it to 4e and rush it to market...? <br/><br/>I'm having a hard time understanding WOTC's strategy here. Let's say 20 game companies must have this thing immediately. That sounds really high to me, actually. But let's go with it. OK, that's $100K in WOTC's pocket. Hasbro notices that not at all. The folks who had to shell out the $5K and then watch everyone get access a few months later notice it though and not in a good way.

It fragmented their user base right out of the gate, essentially leaving them competing with themselves and also - and this is crucial - diluting their brand identity.<br/><br/>By raising a higher, more restrictive barrier around the new OGL, I would guess they're hoping to be able to split the difference this time - get the boost of proven professional, solid third-party publishers producing material right out of the gate, while also keeping the inevitable flood of "1000 house rules" and "Random Harlot Table: The Prestige Classes" stuff off the shelves until they've had a solid 6 months+ to establish the Real D&amp;D brand anew.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118735/#Comment_118735" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T07:14:14+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  7:14AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            According to what I've heard putting your money together won't work well because the kits consist of copy-resistant watermarked binders that you're forbidden to reproduce.

We would have the same clusterfart we had when 3.0 came out. As for protecting sales, this way they make sure that they get first rights to make a buck off their product. If someone else is selling it at the release date, WotC has already made $5k off that company. I can't blame them for this at all and neither should you.

Yeah. Although I would hope that companies know what they are getting into. All the people that design for Windows, for instance. They are benefiting from the base of users attached to Windows and all the built in features. They know that if Windows drastically changes, goes out of style, or tightens its rules about who can design what, they are screwed. If they haven't prepared for that, tough. I think people knew that this could happen when they got into making D20 dependent products. AND, the 3.x stuff will continue out there for free. We are talking about a whole new product here. I've read their sneak-peak book and the game looks radically different than 3.x. It is much more inspired by MMORPG philosophies, for instance. (Wow, I'm hating myself right now because I just sort of defended/pimped Wizards, Microsoft, and WoW. I'm not exactly a fan of any of these companies/products.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Games are not software. Game rules (though not the expressions thereof) are specifically exempted from copyright. One trend I'm finding worrying in games is that people are treating rules like they *are* protected. This is not a big issue with broad open content, but I do worry that very narrow open content will have a chilling effect as people assume that rules are so inviolate that they cannot produce their own expressions of them. This has already happened in one case. Technomancer Press produced d20-compatible supplements with no license whatsoever. Fans assumed that this was illegal and absolutely pilloried them on ENWorld because they used the licenses as the benchmark to judge a company that had nothing to do with them.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the OGL protected people from legal action that might not have actually been particularly valid, but given WotC's ability to throw more money at these things than anybody else, was necessary for some publishers to feel confident in releasing material. Rules shouldn't be treated like software, IMO and there can be some unanticipated outcomes if we accept the analogy wholeheartedly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118782/#Comment_118782" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T09:28:48+00:00" title="January  9, 2008  9:28AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: docholaday</cite>Okay.

Whether you think WotC's decision is a smart business decision or not, it surely doesn't fall under the heading of questionable ethics does it? Illuminate me.</blockquote>\nSince ethics are about values--what you believe is right or good--they're <i>always</i> at stake. If you believe that the only values that matter are what's going to make you the most money in the short term, then all your decisions are easy. However, even most business decisions aren't based solely on the criterion of maximizing short-term gain: multiple criteria, including felt loyalties to different internal and external stakeholders (e.g.,employees, shareholders, "the hobby," the industry, etc.) as well as beliefs about the appropriate means to achieve valid ends (aka "values"). If all those loyalties and values complement each other--if they point in the same direction--then decisions are still easy. Decisions are hard when the decision-maker has conflicting loyalties and competing values.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the issue of whether differential access to the SRD is an economically rational means to achieve some business objective, the ethical dimension emerges when one wonders if it betrays some value or loyalty that WOTC ought to observe. For example, someone might say, "Doesn't WOTC have an ethical [note: <b>not</b> legal] obligation to work with those 3rd party publishers who've proven themselves to be good custodians of WOTC's intellectual property?" And someone else might say, "Sure, but only to the extent that it doesn't mean taking money out of the paychecks of its employees." My point is only that saying that is by definition an ethical decision: it's deciding among competing values and loyalties.<br/><br/>It turns out that most debates over ethical issues are between those who see them and those who don't: that is, between those who perceive the values conflict and those who don't.<br/><br/>But all of this is a digression from the pragmatic question of whether charging $5K for preferential access to the SRD is "instrumentally rational": whether it will achieve the business purpose it's intended to serve, and what precisely that purpose could be. I'm putting in my two cents to expand on Malcolm's attempt to note the distinction between the ethical and the pragmatic dimensions of the discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118789/#Comment_118789" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T10:13:04+00:00" title="January  9, 2008 10:13AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;OK, that's $100K in WOTC's pocket.

That's pretty much what I intended when, upthread, I said they wanted to block entry to (most) 3rd party products for some time: they need a time window to release their new stuff and set the baseline, I guess.<br/><br/>As for the OGL, there will be no OGL anymore, IMO. The "newstyle" OGL is not about fostering the birth of new games and having a handy base system to tweak and license for free; it is about "make supplements for OUR game, or shut up". <br/><br/>Now, I know rules are not copyrightable. They are (arguably) patentable, but only in the US and Japan. But it does not matter: a company making a 4e derivative product that is NOT linked or compatible to the PHB will probably receive the kind of welcome treatment Malcom mentioned upthread. "Pirated, illegal products". Even if they're not.<br/><br/>Why use lawyers when you can use the PR department? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>As for the size of the TTRPG market, and the relevance of DnD as a product in itself (revenue wise) I think it's in plain sight: DnD the ttrpg is only partially translated around the world, unknown to non gamers, and sold mostly in speciality stores. DnD BOOKS, OTOH, are translated regularly and sell bestseller number of copies in many countries.<br/><br/>Heck, here in Italy they publish them, and the settings were NEVER published in italian for the game... now that I think of it, neither was the game. At all. ADnD was a niche inside a niche, since you had to buy it abroad and learn english. I know many Dragonlance readers that don't know of the EXISTENCE of a DnD game... *I* read them many years ago without having seen an ADnD book, ever. Same goes for Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun, and so on.<br/><br/>My impression is that rpg authors are often talented, produce a huge amount of coherent setting stuff, passionate about their work, and *cost pennies*. That's why the dnd rpg is still out, probably: it produces stuff that later on is milked to produce vast amounts of money in other fields (videogames, books, comics, miniatures, toys, and so on). The aggregated income means that the rpg department is hugely profitable, given its (very low) cost.<br/><br/>Ah, well... I'll try and stay out of this thread, now...

If M:TG revenues have decreased, as we're hearing, that means that the $100,000 is even more valuable to WotC overall. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the "unfounded" nature of my assertion, I think I was just repeating something that Peter Adkison said to me once in conversation. Could well be out of date. But let's not even get started on the comparison to the revenues when they had Pokemon. That's a substantial business. D&amp;D the TTRPG is just not a huge money-maker. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote, too, that revenue figures are an awful way of figuring out the value of a line. The owners of D&amp;D have gone bankrupt more than once, because eventually costs are higher than the revenues. $100,000 of near pure profit is maybe three people's jobs for the next year at WotC, if you want to think of it that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, will they get 20 to buy in?

It wasn't a "plot" -- it was a publicly stated objective. Attaching  reflexive aspersions on it doesn't make it go away. Read:  <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/md/md20020228e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/md/md20020228e</a><br/><br/>I don't know how Ryan Dancey saying that the goal is to reduce support for competing systems to the lowest possible level can't spell it out for you any more clearly.<br/><br/>Of course, this didn't happen. He was wrong. The OGL was successful in a fashion that apparently neither drove PHB sales (as 3.5 showed) nor reduced the number of competing systems (as M&amp;M, True20, NWoD and GURPS4th showed). WotC went back to selling exactly the sorts of books they sold during 1e and 2e instead of concentrating on PHB sales and it became a rule (especially post-bubble) that an SRD-based game could only be successful by *not* easily porting to D&amp;D or requiring the PHB.<br/><br/>I think at this point the original OGL is *almost* unnecessary. The most successful games that evolved from the SRD genome could easily be altered to rely on nothing more than prior art, especially since they use so much original text anyway. Nobody owns the mechanic of rolling a d20, adding modifiers and comparing it to a number, or the term "Strength" for how much muscle power characters have. As it stands, the OGL allows for some very quick game hacks, easy sharing for semi-pros (though this is vastly underutilized) and for the consumer, a subtle signal that there's SRD genetic material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118983/#Comment_118983" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-10T11:37:05+00:00" title="January 10, 2008 11:37AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Wait, who lent support?

Practice didn't entirely work out that way due to the gold rush, and the publishers left standing are indeed the ones who got serious about their business, but yes, WotC did make the OGL for a reason.

WotC is trying to maximize support for their flagship product, and hopefully avoid the negative aspects of the d20 boom/bust this time around, not to mention avoid situations like other companies beating them to market with products that imply they are "core rulebooks" (e.g., Creature Catalog I). Regardless, it sounds like the 4e OGL will simply require that your product uses the PHB in some way, just like the d20 STL did.<br/><br/>Rouse has also mentioned that WotC is planning to provide a more flexible OGL when they release the next edition of d20 Modern. Ergo, it looks like the 4e "D&amp;D OGL" will be focused on encouraging D&amp;D support product, while the "Modern OGL" will be the "go crazy nuts making new games" license.<br/><br/><a href="http://robin-d-laws.livejournal.com/254635.html" rel="nofollow">I'm with Robin laws on this one</a>. WotC are trying to improve on what they did with the 3e OGL in terms of their bottom line, while still maintaining the ability for other companies to create d20 product. This is what companies that want to stay in business do.<br/><br/>If that bugs you, the 3.5 and d20 Modern licenses are still in place and aren't going to go away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119351/#Comment_119351" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-13T18:09:13+00:00" title="January 13, 2008  6:09PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>(to avoid the appearance that "support has dried up" for D&amp;D)</blockquote>\nI don't think that WotC is really concerned about this.

This would actually be pretty much the same as the release of 3e, but it needs to be artificially induced because we live in the post DTRPG/Lulu world.<br/><br/>2) Failing that, an efficient parting of fools and their money.<br/><br/>3) The ability to claim they really, really tried to continue open gaming but just couldn't, without actually saying that they don't want to continue wasting their time at something that didn't make them any money the first time around.<br/><br/>Make no mistake: There's no magical force preventing companies from starting production as soon as 4e comes out, license or no. They can release at the same time as anybody else by doing quick edits as soon as they know what the license is. I bet a lot of people will write modules since these are the most likely to be easily adapted from draft to license compliance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119379/#Comment_119379" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T00:12:26+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 12:12AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Mark%2Fbuzz">@Mark/buzz</a>: I'm not really complaining.

Which is my point.<br/><br/>My point is, not being interested in the least in DnD and/or d20 derived stuff, the only thing[*] interesting produced by wotc in the recent years was the original OGL, especially after seeing it used in creative ways by Evilhat and others.<br/><br/>And yeah, like I said there will simply be a fork: Evilhat and others will (presumably) continue to use the oglOGL (free version), and people who want to do DnD supplements will use newOGL. No problem with that.<br/><br/>[*] Not really: Eberron sounds spiffy, with its pulpy feel, but I tried to read the books and man, they are boring as hell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119562/#Comment_119562" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T21:42:50+00:00" title="January 14, 2008  9:42PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I give it ... a month.

Didn't happen, because the community involved in RPG piracy really doesn't give a shit about the rest of the RPG community. There's no swarm-network that makes things bubble up from the ether. There are seeders and leechers (which is why Bitorrent is so amazing -- it functions within the actual network dynamic of filesharing). The latter mostly scan hardcopies, though there are exceptions in small press -- often when the author specifically encourages sharing. Because there are in fact a small number of people who provide source files -- and because the piracy community is based on prestige -- they can often be traced. For example, a lot of pirated White Wolf material comes from a guy named Ruud Dirven -- a guy in his early 40s who lives in Voorburg, in the Netherlands. <br/><br/>It's not impossible but a leak of 4e from inside anyone with the documents is extremely unlikely. Aside from the fact that there's some secure-hardcopy scheme in the works, the fact is that it's just not hard to find the source of something in the industry. I remember one situation where an author broke NDA, someone on RPGNet commented on what this person said without naming them or giving any other clues -- and that person was found maybe three days after the incident occurred. This was not the result of a vigilant witchhunt, but maybe two or three emails.<br/><br/>But never mind. Read lots of Cory Doctorow shallowly and believe that t3h Intarnets Kan Doo Anything.

It can be heard on episode <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2338&amp;Mode=like">#38</a> of the Pulp Gamer Inside Track podcast (link below), which is an interview with with the president of Goodman Games (makers of Dungeon Crawl Classics). As you might expect, if anyone has a solid understanding of the various D&amp;D content licenses, it's this guy. Listen to the whole podcast.
