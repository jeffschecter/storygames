                    I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=810&amp;page=1#Item_46" rel="nofollow">mentioned</a> that I'm tossing ideas around for tweaking the experience system in <i>HeroQuest</i> and I figured I'd share a brief sketch of my thoughts.<br/><br/>1. The default experience system is pretty traditional, which means one thing to me: It's a crap-load of work for the GM to do.  The GM basically has to decide what sorts of activities merit reward (though there's a useful guide in the book), and then constantly be on the lookout for those activities to reward them.  This tends to result in the following behavior (for me): the session ends, I have had a good time and feel everyone did well, and I just give everyone some fixed amount of experience.  This means I'm not really rewarding specific behaviors, not actively shaping play.<br/><br/>Now, it's okay not to actively shape play.  Especially when the players are all on pretty much the same page and play simply rocks on toast without conscious shaping, but I'm a manipulative guy at heart, so I want to nudge people into doing what I want.<br/><br/>2. Most really solid reward systems that I am familiar with reward the player for playing to character.  Take a look at TSOY or BW for a great example of this.  The game rewards you for character conflicts, which is all well and good, except...<br/><br/>For this specific game, I don't need any special reward for character conflicts.  Both my players are going to be running as fast as they can to get into those.  This doesn't mean I shouldn't reward them for it, but rewards are going to be somewhat redundant as the action is rewarding in and of itself.  So, I was thinking about what things that they're both good at that I want to see more of in play.<br/><br/>Turns out that what they both do really well, and do on their own to some degree, is create cool setting/color bits on the fly.  They can both generate rituals and places and organizations that are awesomely evocative, and I want to see more of that.<br/><br/>So, combining these two things, I'm looking around at ways to have players evaluate and reward each other based on cool setting and color stuff.<br/><br/>Now, I don't think that either of my points above are all that revolutionary, and I admit that I may just not be looking very hard, but I don't think I've seen either point articulated clearly.  I mean, PTA has point 1 nailed down, for instance.  The burden of evaluation and reward is totally taken off the GM, allowing said GM to focus attention on other things.<br/><br/>So, what thoughts do you have about experience and reward systems?<br/><br/>Thomas                </div>

                            In my opinion, a reward system whose <i>earning</i> isn't somehow directly tied to the mechanics is lacking something, and also is often too much subject to the whimsy and effort of the GM.  This is especially bad, imho, in games where rewards are handed out, or resources refreshed, every "story," where "story" has no formal definition (unlike, say, a Dogs Town). It feels like they're basically saying "GM, do this when you feel like it."  It's even worse when, on top of these guidelines, the GM is told to judge things like a player's/character's "creativity" or "roleplaying", etc.  (TRoS's Spiritual Attributes, I feel, fall in this category - SA <i>earning</i>, at least in the games I've played, feel very GM-whimsy, but that could just be my GM).<br/>
<br/>
HQ's Hero Points fall in this first category, and a lot of times it does wind up being "at the end of each session," for exactly the reasons you've pointed out.<br/>
<br/>
The newer games, like TSOY with its keys, the famous Dogs Fallout, and if I may be so bold, <b>Fastlane</b> with its chips... these games reward the player, mechanically, for engaging in the mechanics.  BW's skill checks work similarly (and mostly its Artha also, though there's some fiddliness like the SAs, and the "per adventure" comments, that makes me not entirely happy with Artha rewards).  All of these have a reward, or potential reward, per <i>conflict</i>, thus working naturally to reward players more that engage more in the <i>game</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Fan mail is a different, but equally interesting, approach (I'm taking this from the first edition, so perhaps this have changed in 2nd ed PTA) that's also connected to the mechanics.  The amount of fanmail that can be earned is limited by the budget, and players can't award fanmail if the Audience Pool is empty (which I personally think is an important part of the game, the fact that fanmail isn't unlimited).  Also, taking the reward system and the judging from the GM and spreading it out among the group like this, I think, is pretty awesome, because it allows all the player's viewpoints and desires to be spoken and used to reward.  There's no vague 'award this for X or this for Y' just 'award it if you like it'.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's my basic thoughts on XP/reward systems.  A summary, I guess:  Vague rewards (either time-wise, or judgment-wise) are generally bad.  Mechanically connected rewards are good.                        </div>

                            Fanmail, Thomas.<br>
<br>
Knowing you, I suspect that your "things I want in play" will shift about enough that it'll be more useful to you to simply toss fanmail when something happens that you want _in that session._<br>
<br>
Like, remember the white arrows? "White arrows, neat! Fanmail."<br>
<br>
I suspect your players are smart enough to pick up on that. ;)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Lxndr has great thoughts, and I agree with them all.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a lot of vague thoughts about this, since reward systems are pretty well tied to the play targetted and each game has its own target. I do however have some specific thoughts for your HQ game. Actually, doing something like I'm doing in my Delphian Tides (DT) may work well there. I'll just toss it out there and see what you think and perhaps it will spark ideas or something.<br/>
<br/>
Why not let the players invest in this color setting and color you mention? Let them make these things mechanically rewarding, and then let the players bring them back into play later for benefit. This is much like the Issues and Beacons I have in DT. I've never played HQ, so I don't know exactly how you could handle this though.                        </div>

                            If I remember correctly, HeroQuest has this part of the character sheet devoted to the character's Goal, but I don't remember any mechanics to tie it in. If I were redoing it, I'd incorporate the Goal and use something akin to Artha awards or Keys.                        </div>

                            Well, HQ does have another "experience" system outside of Hero Points, that's not really expanded upon, but could be. And it's almost exactly like Fallout. When you fail a roll, you gain temporary or permanent abilities, or modify existing ones.  You can also gain more positive oriented abilities, mainly through items.  In both cases you can spend a Hero Point to cement them. The only problem becomes how players get HP.<br><br>For that you could either go the fan mail route. Other players pass them out for cool stuff.  Or you can tie it into the success system.  Maybe you get them for succeeding.  Maybe you get them for failing (and like BW, there are certain limits).  Maybe its a chart like DitV where you sometimes get HP and sometimes get a trait in failure (and/or success).<br><br>Actually, I recall something similiar being talked about on the HQ rules Yahoo group.  I found this link, which looks like what came out of it, or at the very least, inspired by that discussion:<br/><a href="http://random.average-bear.com/Heroquest/AlternateCharacterAdvancementRules" rel="nofollow">HQ Alternate advancement rules</a> </br></br></br></br></div>
