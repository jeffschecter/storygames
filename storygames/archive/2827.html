This does spice-up life, just like more adversity spices-up a game.<br/><br/>But I also used the pejorative term 'emo posturing' to describe this, as-in: the cliche of a privileged suburban kid who sings about angst and suffering; <br/>because they think it makes them sound interesting/ dark/ sensitive/ profound/ punk/ whatever.   Despite the kid's lack of actual external adversity.<br/><br/>I applied this to story games by saying that systems which ask players to author adversity for their own character-- are too close for my comfort--<br/>to asking us to indulge in emo/drama-queen smoke &amp; mirrors.<br/><br/>Whereas systems which generate adverse results mechanically (or via the actions of a different player than the one controlling the affected-character)<br/>allow each player to embrace their own character's interest unequivocally.<br/><br/>I raised all-this in defense of games which DO dictate a win/lose result, beyond the control of the affected PC's player.<br/>Regardless of whether that player would have preferred to explore the other outcome.<br/><br/>I'm talking about games which which DON'T 'empower' players to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shop</span> between outcomes and choose freely (with mechanical consequences)<br/>whichever outcome suits their desired-direction for the story to progress.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64200/#Comment_64200" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T15:49:42+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  3:49PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2007 3:50PM by jhkim.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

Certainly when I'm playing a character, I don't like being in charge of both creating and describing my own character's problems AND creating and describing the way that problem is ultimately resolved.  I want someone else's input in there, if only to assure myself that there is at least one other person at the table who I can play off of and interact with.  I'm not showing up every week to perform a one-man show or tell a story <i>to</i> my friends, after all: I want to play <i>with</i> them.  If sole authorship (or even something as close to sole authorship as an RPG can provide) was what I was aiming for, I'd just stay home.<br/><br/>Put another way, I don't mind making suggestions about what kind of conflict to hit a character with or ideas for how things might work out in the end, but for me to really connect with the climactic scenes and have fun in the game, I <i>need</i> someone else on the "other side" of the conflict, someone who will throw unexpected things at me to react to and who will react to the unexpected things I throw at them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64259/#Comment_64259" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T07:39:36+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  7:39AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, actual-play example time:  I'm playing Anvil-Lord Roland in <i>Burning Empires</i> these days.  He is the second son of the Forged Lord of the planet, but he's now first in line because his brother Sebastian (played by my buddy Eric) disgraced himself so thoroughly.  Sebastian's been hunted for years, and Roland hate-hate-HATEs him in the way that only a very loving brother who feels utterly betrayed can hate.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's not the thing.  Sebastian had a fiance, Skuld.  Roland loved Skuld even back when Sebastian was the golden boy.  He got very good at suppressing those feelings, and dealing with her on a purely formal level.  Roland <i>inherited</i> her as fiance when Sebastian became unavailable, but he hasn't stopped treating her as if she's off-limits romantically.  Also, Skuld still loves (and hates) Sebastian, and while she thinks she's subtle about it ... she's not.  Messy, yes?  It gets worse when Roland captures Sebastian in his father's name, and Skuld is assigned the task of prosecuting him for his many crimes, but everyone is hinting that Sebastian may get away with a slap on the wrist and be reinstated as both heir <i>and</i> fiance.<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you, Eric and I <i>came up with this shit</i>.  Sydney, our GM, is happy to play it to the hilt, but this is all material that we created in order to make our characters bleed.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast wednesday, Roland drew Skuld into a verbal cage-match over the subject of Sebastian.  He came right out and said that he thought, as his future wife, she should have refused the job of prosecuting him.  Skuld replied that she's a good soldier, and she's not going to let someone who <i>MIGHT</i> marry her some day change that.  I had Roland reply by savagely kissing her.  She slapped him, naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat whole sequence, to me, is about screwing over Roland, and Skuld and Sebastian ... ramping the angst and dysfunction of the situation up to 11 and letting it rip.<br/>\n<br/>\nI simply don't know if that's the same thing that Curly is talking about when he discusses Emo Drama Queens.  Maybe this kind of play turns his stomach.  It's not for everyone.  But it is play that I, myself, like so very much that my first instinct is to trot out the old saw of "Oh ... if he thinks he doesn't like it then he must not understand."<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully the leavening of actual play will help us to figure out where our disagreements here arise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64280/#Comment_64280" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T12:23:56+00:00" title="April 18, 2007 12:23PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>but for me to really connect with the climactic scenes and have fun in the game, I<i>need</i>someone else on the "other side" of the conflict, someone who will throw unexpected things at me to react to and who will react to the unexpected things I throw at them.</blockquote>\nSee, that the bit that I might be confused on.<br><br>Say that I initiate a conflict with you.

I think the Czege Principle as expressed sounds like a good rule of thumb, but there may be exceptions.  I'd distinguish two things here: <br/><br/>1) Setting up a situation outside of active play is different than playing your own opposition within play.  So, say, taking a "Hunted" disadvantage is different than playing the enemy as he hunts down your PC.  The former doesn't even relate to the Czege principle or Curly's complaint, I think.  <br/><br/>2) I can't quite tell from the description whether this involves.  I have at least a similar feeling to Curly's.  In both role-playing and in non-interactive media, there are certain characters that I find extremely frustrating.  By their behavior, they make trouble for themselves to the point that I just want to slap them around.  Of course, if I cares enough about a fictional character to want to slap them around, then the fiction is doing something right -- but it can still be darn annoying<br/><br/>I can't tell from the description if Roland gives any of that vibe.  The question would be, does Roland actually seem to be trying to improve things for himself?  Or do I get the vibe that he is doing things simply in order to cause trouble for himself?  <br/><br/>If he did, it wouldn't be the end of the world or anything, but it can be off-putting.  It depends on the context, though.  I'm in the middle of a <i>With Great Power...</i> game right now, and it has a similar vibe to me.  The players are motivated to damage the things the PC cares about, although not too badly.  However, it comes across as a self-aware commentary or parody.  The players aren't providing their own adversity on the game level -- but they are on an in-character level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64288/#Comment_64288" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T13:41:28+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  1:41PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John:  FWIW, Roland <b>is</b> trying to improve his life ... he is trying quite hard to kill his older brother.

I think the Czege Principle is all about "I have utter control over the creation, introduction, and resolution of this instance of conflict."  TonyLB's example doesn't match for a couple of reasons.

Authoring it is actually playing it out.  Which from your last sentence I get the sense that you want someone else to do.  Using Tony's example, it'd be pretty unfun to have authorship rights during play for Roland, Skuld and Roland's brother.  If I'm playing Roland, I want someone else playing the other two characters and playing them to the hilt.  I want someone else authoring my adversity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64387/#Comment_64387" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T08:31:47+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  8:31AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite><br/>Maybe I'm off base here but setting up the initial conditions for your adversity (ie determining the situation) isn't the same as "authoring" it.

I want to have this thing (say, "driven by my rivalry with my brother") that is omni-present in my conflicts. No matter whether I win or lose the conflicts, my rivalry with my brother always impacts my choices - and generally for the worse. If I win the hand of Princess Saralinda, it's only to spite my brother, and if I don't, I'll find some way to blame it on him. In general, I don't want another player at the table to be able to define how my rivalry-with-brother manifests itself. I want the other players to provide conflicts that my character cares about winning because of some OTHER goal.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at is that sometimes "adversity" is situation - and then the Czege Principle applies. Other times, it's <i>character</i>, and then I want it to be mine-all-mine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64394/#Comment_64394" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T09:04:37+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  9:04AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah...

I'd compare that to Method acting, <br/>which requires the actors to whip -themselves- into an emotional<br/>frenzy, even if they woke up feeling cool and centered. <br/><br/>Well, that would be fine if the players are ok with losing their cool in order to get results.<br/><br/>AND (here's the part I don't think is so great) the players must also be ok with being their<br/>own provocateurs-- playing both the agent of getting-unhinged/ and the person who gets unhinged.<br/><br/>What I am saying is, [sometimes] I prefer a game which doesn't require me to get <span style="text-decoration: underline;">myself</span> worked-up.<br/>Because getting myself all worked up is too much like indulging in self-pity, unfounded outrage, narcissism,<br/>believing my own bullshit, training myself to lose my cool instead of to maintain it, taking a test where I<br/>know all the answers (and then pretending the results have significance).<br/><br/>If that's clear, then we can discuss specific rules which support each mode of play.<br/><br/>As an alternative, I've suggested that a game which takes the role of Curly-worker-upper and gives it to either<br/>an impartial rules mechanic or another player-- and lets me sincerely try to stay cool against a real opposing force;<br/>and if I lose that struggle, so be it.   But I won't have to conflict-my-interest like a boxer 'taking a fall'.  <br/>This alternative is nothing more than the Czege Principle.<br/><br/>The entire point I was trying to make in the "Beef with Graham" discussion, as well as this here, is that a nice side-effect<br/>of farming-out the adversity to a source outside the affected-player; is that it allows emotional subject matter, <br/>while keeping the emotional fireworks <span style="text-decoration: underline;">optional</span>.   Because if the player doesn't want to get all messy, wallowing around<br/>in the emotions; then the player can leave the feeling of the emotions to the character; and focus on the tactical aspect<br/>of defending-against the external source of the adversity.  Which can be emotional too, of course.<br/><br/>When adversity isn't tactical, that is to say when it's the player vs. himself, then emotional naval-gazing is the only<br/>variety of emotional kicks supported.  And that's ok.  Unless it's mandatory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64591/#Comment_64591" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-20T19:41:17+00:00" title="April 20, 2007  7:41PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this <i>entirely</i> hypothetical?

He rejects the Czege Principle when it comes a character issues, wanting inner adversity to be "mine all mine";<br/>with no meddling by any other players.   Nor does he want his character to find a way out of the agony-maze.  He explicitly rejects the possibility of his character "getting over" or "resolving" that-which impedes him, and pre-determines that all outcomes will be "generally for the worse".    He's unabashedly emo.   His recipe for play demands that a player must yank his own chain, and enjoy it.<br/><br/>An example of my own-- was an impromptu 'let me introduce you to trendy Forge ideas' type of game I played with a woman; in which I suggested she play as 'herself' &amp; I used her actual boss &amp; co-workers as adversaries.   Because I've often heard her complain about work, I understand the firm's real life intrigues.  So this time I was the emo player, crafting thorny soap opera dilemmas. <br/><br/>Rather than approach the game like "wow, I really would be taken aback if this stuff did happen one day," she instead made decisions in a purely tactical, robotic way.  She didn't take the emotional bait.   And because I was trying to demostrate all sorts of indie goodness at once; she had nearly-unchecked ability to narrate, frame stakes, veto, initiate conflict in order to recharge her resources (a dice pool).  In short, I was the author of every bit of the adversity; but she had overwhelming power to trump anything I unleashed.   The only uncoercive way to balance the game, would be if she 'lent' some of her power to the adversity side; by helping craft ways to trip-up her own character. And she simply wasn't inclined to do so.  Either that, or I coulda taken-away some of her 'empowerment'; and given the system or myself Deterministic power to impose adversity on her... cold hard tangible adversity (like a killer janitor with a chainsaw), since she merely shrugged-off the intangible stuff.<br/><br/>The part that is hypothetical is my suspicion that Keys are a mechanic which works-best with emo-motivated players.  I haven't played with Keys, so I don't know.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
