But in the afternoons and evenings we usually had about as many players as we could handle given the number of GMs that we had.<br/><br/>It was a lot of fun!  Every game I played for GoD was excellent.  In many cases we had players completely new to weirdo indie games.  Many players had very positive things to say about what we were doing.<br/><br/><br/>I also wound up eating Jeni's ice cream every day I was there.

It was an excellent event. I stopped by on Saturday night, planning to play in an off-the-books Dresden game that Morgan Ellis was going to run. However, as we prepped to do so, a huge influx of Demanders came in and both Morgan and I were pressed into service to run official events. We had, I think, something on order of 6 or 7 full tables going. I ran a lot of Fiasco, and was lucky enough to have someone request a game of School Daze (which turned out to be the best session I've run so far).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had two seminars that went very well. Gaming and Social Media was helped a great deal by the presences of Will Hindmarch and Dave Chalker on either side of me. Designing in Public had a decently sized group (for Origins) and we they had a lot of good questions to add to the notes I'd made for myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also got some suggestions and inspirations for my next game, which is always a great thing to have happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttendance seemed to be down, but I spent a lot of time at Games on Demand, so it's hard to tell. Still, it seemed like everyone I talked to had a good time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380652/#Comment_380652" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-03T19:13:03+00:00" title="June  3, 2012  7:13PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wound up playing lots of cool games at Games on Demand:<br><br><b>Kagematsu </b>(which was really interesting but really difficult for me)<br><b>A Penny For My Thoughts</b> (with the poetic tale of a homosexual street thug, a hevy metal car salesman and others)<br><b>Apocalypse World</b> (Aaron Sturgill's PC reluctnantly seduced a viking lady to stop a gang war)<br><b>Fiasco: New York 1914</b> (continuing a theme from before, more unwanted romantic advances on Aaron's PC, a pretty young communist)<br><b>Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</b> (letter writers aren't always honest about their problems)<br/><b>Action Castle and Spooky Manor</b> (You have been burned alive.

On Thursday, Friday and Saturday I was in the boardgame/miniatures hall running hour long alternating games of Jump the Shark (a B-movie script writing game) and my new game Snapshot: 1969 (a Hippie adventure card game). Games took around a half hour so I generally ran players through both games. Today I went to the Games on Demand room and ran Snapshot for a couple of players (Mr. Teapot) and then played in Fiasco Flyover.<br/><br/>I got to play in a great WWII miniatures game run by Jim Morrison - kick ass miniatures and nice simple rules. My men were plastered and we lost big. Our plan was perfect but our execution was flawed.<br/><br/>In the dealers area I bought a bunch of 15mm figures from Rebel Miniatures: Taliban, Deep Ones, Street Rioters, Mall Cops, Street Punks, some other odds and ends and guys on motorcyles. I can see a future post-apocalyptic race game ala "Damnation Alley".<br/><br/>I was very pleased with the quality of the Snapshot cards. I just got them on Tuesday and they stood up to con use with no noticeable shop ware. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esoteric" title="Esoteric"><img alt="Esoteric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esoteric">Esoteric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380655/#Comment_380655" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-03T19:35:34+00:00" title="June  3, 2012  7:35PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2012 7:38PM by Esoteric.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I live about an hour from Columbus, so despite being a poor college student I was able to pop in on Saturday, game, and eat delicious ice cream. Awesome.<br/><br/>Saturday morning we hit GoD just a little late, but Nick picked us up for a game of Fiasco, which went really well. I was the bitch, Marcie Lowell, and my fate was probably not deserved, but completely fitting. Thanks Nick! My dad also played in that game, which was totally cool because I've been slowly introducing him to indie games over the last few years. He now owns a copy of Fiasco, and is excited to introduce it to his group.<br/><br/>After GoD we decided to find a seminar, so we ended up wandering into Designing in Public. Tracy did a great job- my friend said it made him think about his own insecurities about putting his ideas online, my dad had never thought of writing his own game and found the idea interesting, and I just though that having internet conversations in real life was weird.<br/><br/>We missed the afternoon GoD slot by falling into the trap that is North Market. I have very few regrets.<br/><br/>Right before calling it a day we ran into Patrick Rothfuss in the dealers hall. Friendliest guy you could ever meet. <br/><br/>Seeing internet people in real life is weird. I have to go to more conventions, and I have to play more games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulSSG" title="PaulSSG"><img alt="PaulSSG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/471/nGK5LIJSLNJ4W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulSSG">PaulSSG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380661/#Comment_380661" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-03T21:28:55+00:00" title="June  3, 2012  9:28PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Long time listener, first time Origin-er.<br/>\n<br/>\nCame to GoD hoping to play Apocalpyse and Death School (never played them), but never could quite get a quorum on them.  Never mind.  What I played (which I'd *also* never played before) knocked my socks off:<br/>\n<br/>\n*) 3:16.  Has NO right to be this transparently dumb, and this fun.  Perfect start.<br/>\n*) Project: Dark.  As a playtester, I don't know how much I can/should reveal here.  But the central mechanics of "hand size = amount of cover" and "deckbuilding for desired powers" were smooth, and the mechanics led to solid choices for narrative gameplay.  A great "Italian Job"-style game.<br/>\n*) Kagematsu.  Wow.  Irmalei *killed* as the title character, and we collectively created one of the better spontaneous narratives I've seen come out of "stranger play".  The last 15 minutes were so good, I needed a glass of scotch afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso picked up hard copies of Polaris, Perfect Unrevised, and Annalise at the IPR booth, and 3:16 at Cubicle 7.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso ate some really mediocre quesadillas, drank some great scotch, and met some top-shelf people.  Every one of the GoD staff went above and beyond with their ability and desire to create good experiences for new players -- the exact opposite of my experiences at GenCon about 10 years ago.  Thank you all.  More of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't see Day or Wheaton.  I saw Will and Kira, Jim and Irmalei, Crusher and Nall.  Good times.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext year, I show up on Wednesday, and I stay at the Hyatt.  (Fun fact: The Rodeway Inn on exit 97 is a Fiasco playset.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380685/#Comment_380685" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T06:32:27+00:00" title="June  4, 2012  6:32AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, too satisfied/tired.

I took part in a BGG game trade and came away with a suitcase full of DnD 4E books, then bought a few more to round out my collection. Somehow along the way I hurt my back and am still feelin it today.<br/><br/>The vendor area where I spent most of my time seemed a bit more sparse. Though they had filled the whole area with vendors, there was a lot more space between them, so at best it was an illusion. I did encounter several vendors with very interesting looking games that directed potential buyers to Kickstarter. I found that a bit annoying. I don't fault those people for getting the word out about their games, I just hate being told "Here is this cool thing you can't have right now and here are some hoops for you to jump through to maybe get it later."<br/><br/>It also seemed there were fewer vendors actually demoing games. The ones that were tended to have a crowd. Someone on BGG posted something similar, that many vendors seemed hesitant to demo anything at their booths.<br/><br/>BTW, did anyone notice the absence of a lot of big name vendors, like Paizo and Privateer Press? I was kinda shocked that only one booth seemed to be selling Hordes stuff, and not very much. Miniatures gaming in general seemed to be down, as a quick walk through of the miniatures area showed very few of the large terrain setups. <br/><br/>I did not make it to Games on Demand. I actually felt like I didn't have enough time to do the stuff I wanted to do. Next year I plan on getting a full weekend pass and spending the night so I can get in on some actual games. Shopping is fun, but I did leave feeling I had missed out on a bunch of cool opportunities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380700/#Comment_380700" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T08:40:51+00:00" title="June  4, 2012  8:40AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I came down for the weekend, The con seemed a little anaemic to me, particularly the WotC area.

Me and Jim Crocker and Nick Wedig did the organizing, while Tracy Barnett, Victor Wyatt, Evan Dicken, and Morgan Ellis helped us with the official GMing. When we were overwhelmed with people we had some rockstars step up and run games, like Mark Truman, Bill White, Stazsh, Irmelin, Travis, Wil Hindmarch, and Daniel. The busiest times were definitely the 8pm-12am slot on Friday and Saturday, and the slowest at the 9am-12pm Friday and Saturday. Afternoons were steady with people from 1pm-6pm, but not overwhelmingly so. I think that Jim has a master list of all the games played, and a loose record is visible on the facebook page... it was a pretty big variety actually.The community vibe was really there, everyone was really excited to try new things and volunteer to run games. The response was overwhelmingly positive. John Ward, the guy who organizes Origins, said there were three hot places to be in the RPG area: Pathfinder, Cthulhu, and Indie Games on Demand! <br/><br/>Jim and I are going to work up a best practices observations we made type of document, but I can list a few things off the top of my head.<br/><br/>1.\tHaving official times in the event book helped us both draw people and offer our GMs badges. I think this might be the best way to do it in the future. When people arrived at the room, regardless of which GM they were signed up for we organized them according to game taste and collected their tickets/tokens. GMs would record on an index card # of players, GM name, event time, game played. Afterwards, we organized them according to event number to hand in to GAMA so they could track it properly for their records. When I talked to Derek (the organizer at Gencon) at Origins, he said that\u2019s good practice for Gencon too. <br/>2.\tHaving the dry erase board schedule was super helpful. GMs could look at when we needed more coverage, and players could see when things were being offered! I would even have 2 dry erase boards, or something else to record all the rules (2 tokens per game, list of games available, that kind of thing)<br/>3.\tThe table of games at the entrance of the room next to the dry erase board allowed people to peruse earlier in the day when games were being run, and then request one for later in the day that looked interesting to them. We also had a request notepad up near the pile of games, so we had an idea of what people wanted to play and when.<br/>4.\tJim created this really nice PDF showing off the games he personally could run, and the elevator pitch. Wil did the same. Having a list of these on the wall or on the table might just be some extra cool info for people to peruse so you don\u2019t have to constantly give the elevator pitches.<br/>5.\tDefinitely have tons of GMs Friday and Saturday nights.<br/>6.\tOur times worked well! We broke for dinner every day, and everyone stayed til at least midnight rolling dice.<br/><br/>I played/facilitated/ran a bunch of games. I was in two Apocalypse World games (the first time I\u2019ve actually played instead of GMed in forever!) two Kagematsu games, Fiasco, and Technoir. I think my favorite game of the con was Saturday night Kagematsu, when this cool girl Irmelin came up to me and asked if she could play Kagematsu, and I was like, well sure even though it\u2019s usually male players, and she was like \u201cno, I mean, I want to play Kagematsu, I want to run it.\u201d I was like, hell yes! She did an awesome job as the ronin, and I was there for rules help. It was an intense game, everyone was pretty invested in saving that town. My second favorite was Jim running a game of Monsterhearts for my local group who tend toward more traditional games\u2026 AND THEY LOVED IT! Total win. Converted.<br/><br/>The other awesome thing I saw was a bunch of players wandering in from the Pathfinder rooms to try out these indie games they\u2019ve heard so much about. And players who have never really played RPGs before. Lots of players were trying to grok the mechanics, and getting into the roleplay secondarily. Most people were saying they wanted to understand how the games worked so they could take them home and run them for their own groups, so there were lots of rules discussions. This was great. I think they best example of this was when a group of darkly dressed folk came into play Dread, but we didn\u2019t have anyone running it. We said, well, have you heard of Fiasco? They all looked pretty skeptical, but then Tracy sat down and ran it for them and they had a blast. I was surprised to see them again the next day. I was like, so what are you here to play this time? \u201cCan you guys run Fiasco again, we loved it!\u201d I also heard that at Wil Wheton\u2019s panel he was asked what was the best RPG for beginners, and he said Fiasco, without a doubt. So Fiasco was winning.<br/><br/>I filmed a lot of footage in my Iphone that I plan to piece together for one cool thing, so hopefully it turned out well. Big Bar on 2 Saturday night was the hardest I think I\u2019ve laughed in like, weeks. Keep your eyes out for the hot new indie game based on David Cronenberg\u2019s Crash called Rubbernecking. I talked with a lot of people about the games and projects they\u2019re working on, and they all sounded really cool. Get that shit out so we can playtest it (Phil)! My friends and I cosplayed Supernatural, and our Fem Dean (me) and Fem Sam and Castiel got recognized about 5 times, which I was happy about, but we missed Felicia Day for a photo with the three of us (she was just on Supernatural). Everyone thought my drawn on pentacle tattoo was real.<br/><br/>Apparently there\u2019s this HUGE Are You A Werewolf community every year at Origins that I had no idea about\u2026 their games run like, 24 hours a day. I went down at 3am on Saturday and they still had easily 100 people in that room, accusing and lynching villagers left and right. Super fun, definitely play if you get the chance. I also played 7 Wonders, a fun resource management game about building the 7 Wonders of the world like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon or the Great Pyramids. The best part about this is it only takes like, 30 mins to a half hour to play. There was also this new Wargame that came out that I think was called Strike of the Eagle that Ken Hite was talking about that sounded like a wargame I would actually play. Apparently it has some kind of politicking mechanic. I bought Monsterhearts, Dread, and Ocean at IPR, and those neat metal dice from France with all the cool designs on them.<br/><br/>So those were the highlights! This was the most fun I\u2019ve had at Origins in a few years, and it was mostly because of the community. Thanks to everyone who came to Columbus for entertaining me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380748/#Comment_380748" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T15:02:34+00:00" title="June  4, 2012  3:02PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Kira.<br/><br/>This makes me really... really excited for Gen Con!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pterrysaur" title="Pterrysaur"><img alt="Pterrysaur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pterrysaur">Pterrysaur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380749/#Comment_380749" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-04T15:04:44+00:00" title="June  4, 2012  3:04PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So awesome!

Which is to say, I got to see a wide array of wonderful people, some familiar and some new to me, and I feel smarter, recharged, and more ambitious for it. Origins is the show where I can spend a whole afternoon, meal, and evening playing games with people and still easily catch up with the late-night crowd for drinks at the Big Bar. Origins is the show where I can let conversations unfold for a while without fear that I'll be late for this panel, that meal meeting, or whatever. <br><br>At Origins I can breathe (although not, apparently, eat\u2014I ate something like eight meals over six days) and take the time to ask more questions of savvy folk or bask in the enthusiasm of Games on Demand.<br><br/>Since sales numbers at Origins are so poor, so often, it has sort of become my show to play about the future, rather than the present. As it turns out, I sort of didn't play any games that actually existed in published form at the show this year. (I played, and finally fully grokked, Danger Patrol, though, if that counts.) Instead, I mostly playtested. <br/><br/>I got to play Magpie Games' <i>Our Last Best Hope</i> with a great table, which was terrific and provocative fun.<br/><br/>I played two wonderfully populated sessions of my Blackbird hack, <i>Always/Never/Now</i>, which have lit the way to my final design decisions.<br/><br/>I played a generous and encouraging session of the game code-named <b>Project: Dark</b> with bright and savvy minds. Invigorating.<br/><br/>I manned the DriveThru booth a bit, I got to have a conversation with Mark and Marissa from Magpie, the mighty Jim Crocker, and other fine folks that I could seldom have on the Internet, about big topics in games and design, and my gratitude for that is a fine, shiny gem.<br/><br/>I got to corner folks like Bill White and his friends and poke them with questions. I presented a couple of Origins awards and fell into two or three conversations that might yield a pair of narrative games which may or may not be story games in the far future. I drank a few beers in one of my favorite Columbus bars. I got to ride around the city a bit and experience a late-night cab ride that was like free fuel to any writer thirsty for Americana. That cab, packed full with liquor-lubed game writers and graphic designers, fell silent as we all soaked up the music of the dispatch calls so we could wring it out into our writing later.<br/><br/>I was met with lamentations about Origins' health and fate throughout the show, from the bar to the generic-ticket line. I talked to a guy on the plane back who said the board-gaming rooms felt half-empty. It felt like a thinning show wearing clothes too big for it, sometimes. But everyone I talked to during the show seemed happy to be there and seemed to be playing games.<br/><br/>So here's a toast to your Jim Crockers and Kira Scotts and Nick Wedigs and the company they keep. Here's to the curious newcomers who walked into Clark saying "I've never played an RPG and I'm curious to see what they're all about." Here's to next year.<br/><br/>Alas, I did not get to say proper goodbyes. Instead I say this: I thank y'all and hope to see you at Gen Con.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mcellis" title="mcellis"><img alt="mcellis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mcellis">mcellis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380866/#Comment_380866" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-05T13:56:21+00:00" title="June  5, 2012  1:56PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>I had a good time at Origins!

I should have let you crush the hell out of that White Ape. Same thing with removing the legionnaires. <br/><br/>I'll also admit that I was thrown off of my game because I'm used to running that game for 5-6 people not 3 and things were really going faster than I was expecting. I didn't want to cheat folks out of game time, but the result was shutting you down and for that I'd like to apologize. Still I had a great time with that game and I'm glad we got to play together.<br/><br/>Next year I am going to spend most of my gaming time in the Games on Demand room. I actually had a pretty good success ratio with non GoD games, but only with GMs that were known quantities to me. I am also jonesing for some Fiasco, I ended up running games during the three slots I was at GoD and didn't get to play any games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380885/#Comment_380885" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-05T15:26:26+00:00" title="June  5, 2012  3:26PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2012 5:10PM by Nathan_H.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kira, thank you for bringing the funk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380890/#Comment_380890" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-05T16:08:11+00:00" title="June  5, 2012  4:08PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Morgan -- You ran a great game! We all had a blast, and my moment of being disappointed about not just stomping that White Ape was a mere moment, and I totally got him on my next turn. Listening again to the AP audio, I hear that I was worried that someone else would steal my glory, which was not all that mature on my part. It's okay for a GM to worry about pacing, so I don't fault you for it. I guess I didn't expect that you'd invoke the Ape's aspects defensively, but that was a legitimate move. <br/><br/>You could have totally manipulated me into buying into it, too, if you'd held out the Fate point and made me buy off the White Ape's "Four-Armed Terror" aspect (or whatever) with my last Fate point and then punched another Aspect that I couldn't buy off, and then stroked my ego by stressing the incredible damage I'd dished out to the creature in narrating the results. A White Ape who wasn't out of the fight but was mewling in terror and fear? I would have lapped it up and kept after him. Pacing problem solved!<br/><br/>As for "clearing the decks" of the troopers, it's natural to want to distill things to their essence, but especially in pulp games the more moving parts the better. <i>You mean you fought Emperor Xiang, his mind-witch, a white ape, <b>and</b> his personal bodyguard?

I think we have some new fans!<br/><br/>Thursday night I played the new Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG with my wife and Doug Kovacs, who did much of the art.

It is out to the GMs for final approval, but preliminary numbers show:<br/><br/>We had total GoD sessions. Morning sessions were most lightly attended, evening sessions were heaviest. Others creating similar events should keep this in mind!<br/><br/>We ran a total of 41 games, that served a total of ~171 players across those various time slots. Obviously, that's not unique numbers, many of those are repeats, but that total does NOT include any games where GMs facilitated AS players, as near as I'm able to verify. <br/><br/>So, most of our best practices and pitfalls have already been covered by others: weight your staffing towards the latter part of the day; 3 slots with a nice long dinner break worked very well for us, and we recommend it to others; a table up front with example game books, info sheets for the GMs, and a sign-up list for future slots all seem like good ideas, as is a big tote board/white board listing the slots each GM is available and what games are on offer.<br/><br/>Fiasco is the clear popular favorite; it was asked for repeatedly by name; Steve and Jason's 'Instant Fiasco' kits came in very handy, and were much-used; we recharged them with index cards for GenCon and will pass them off to John and Terry at DexCon.<br/><br/>It would be cool if we could develop some kind of standardized tracking sheet for organizers of these events; our index card system was inconsistent in implementation and collection.<br/><br/>Next year, I MIGHT bag the Sunday slot and instead invite folks to a wrap-up brunch, or be specific about having us all bring breakfast to the room or something; we did get one brand-new player, but it was otherwise pretty dead, and there wasn't any sort of organized social gathering afterwards.<br/><br/>I had to defer some GAMA business I really ought to have been working on to do all those slots; next year I will have to be a little less involved, but I think that this year's success and GAMA's strong positive reaction to it (John Ward was already talking to me about how big a room we could handle next year) bode well for our future success.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish that I had though earlier to create a script for all of our GMs to encourage players who enjoyed themselves to take a minute to give feedback to event organizers (GAMA GenCon, LLC) about enjoying our event and encouraging them to continue to support it. I did this in an ad-hoc way on Saturday after I thought of it with my own players, but it'd be smart to have some boilerplate we encourage all the GMs to use consistently throughout the event.<br/><br/>HIGH POINTS: Running Monsterhearts for an enthusiastic group of Kira's friends, riding shotgun with Ken Hite and Will Hindmarch on the flight in from Chicago, playtesting Will's Project:Dark, answering the question "How many Troopers does it take to change a light bulb?", getting to save the Earth from a Uranium Chain Reaction, and pretty much every other game I played! <br/><br/>LOW POINTS: Trying to juggle my GAMA obligations with my GoD obligations and getting in a bit of trouble over the former, being so sick and exhausted I literally passed out Friday night and had to skip Saturday morning, and a deeply unpleasant travel interaction on my way home.<br/><br/>Thanks, all, for the very kind words and of course all the hard work. I'll post up our final list of games played and attendance numbers on Tuesday after it gets vetted by the GMs over the weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381875/#Comment_381875" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T10:56:59+00:00" title="June 11, 2012 10:56AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great job, Jim.

I'm simply quoting ICV2, none of the words below are my own:<br/><br/>Attendance at the Origins Game Fair in Columbus, Ohio was down slightly in 2012 due largely to lighter attendance on the week days. Overall attendance at Origins was 11,332, a 180 fewer than attended in 2011 (11,502). More full show \u201cbadges\u201d were sold in 2012 (6,845) than in 2011 (6,545), but here were fewer Day Passes (4,457 to 4,957).<br/><br/>The Origins Exhibition Hall was sold out for the third year in a row (see \u201cOrigins 2011 Exhibit Hall Sold Out\u201d). The 2012 decline in attendance represents just 1.5% fewer attendees than in 2011."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382979/#Comment_382979" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T11:37:33+00:00" title="June 21, 2012 11:37AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The <a href="http://www.originsgamefair.com/" rel="nofollow">official Origins page</a> confirms those numbers and gives a tiny bit more detail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382985/#Comment_382985" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T13:13:58+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  1:13PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Still higher attendance!
