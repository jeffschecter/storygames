The person who runs the game is called the <strong>referee</strong>.  Everyone else is called a <strong>player</strong>.</p>\n<p>The players will need to create characters.  To create a character:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose a Character Class</li>\n<li>Fill out your Character Sheet based on that class's details at 4th Level</li>\n<li>Mark (3d6)*10 as your Starting Gold</li>\n<li>Spend some or all of your gold on equipment in the Equipment chapter</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The referee will need to prepare an adventure - a fictional situation for the player characters to unravel.  The adventure usually comprises a map and your notes about certain locations on the map. At the beginning of the game, sketch out a single village and its surround. Then, as the player characters explore beyond this region, expand the map to the cities, forests, and kingdoms of the world beyond.</p>\n<h2>Starting Play</h2>\n<p>If you're a player, your job is to <strong>speak for your character</strong>, telling the referee what your character says and does.</p>\n<p>If you're a referee, your job is to <strong>provide interesting challenges</strong> and then <strong>present the fictional world fairly</strong>.  This means cultivating an internal image of the campaign world, and speaking for the monsters and other characters the player characters will encounter during the game.  When the players try something, refer to the map and your notes to describe what happens as a result. Sometimes the players will do something unexpected, and you\u2019ll have to think on your feet, making things up as you go. Stay true to prepared material, pay attention to details, make rulings dispassionately, and try to keep things consistent.</p>\n<p>Whether you're a referee or a player, sometimes what you say will trigger rules - that's called making a "move".  Moves mostly revolve around combat, experience, physical movement, healing, dying, and magic.</p>\n<p>The game begins with the referee <strong>describing where the characters are, and what they see</strong>.  As a player, <strong>describe what your character does</strong>.  If that follows under some more specific move, like if you <strong>attack an opponent with a missile weapon</strong> use that move's rules.  A few moves follow this section.  Other moves, especially those in the Action chapter, can be used by either the referee or the players, depending on the situation.</p>\n<p>The referee decides where the game starts; it could be a rural peasant village, in a vast and teeming city spiked with towers and minarets, in a castle, a tavern, or at the gates of an ancient tomb. From that point on, each player describes what their character does. Going down stairs, attacking a dragon, talking to the people you meet: all of these sorts of things are player decisions. The referee then tells the players what happens as a result: the stairs lead down to a huge tomb, the dragon attacks your character, etc.</p>\n<h3>Player Moves</h3>\n<p>When you <strong>describe what your character does</strong> see if there is a more specific move that covers the action.  If not, the referee will tell you what happens as a result.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>talk to the people you meet</strong> the referee will speak for them.</p>\n<h3>Referee Moves</h3>\n<p>Whenever you have a chance to talk and you aren't already making another move, <strong>describe where the characters are, and what they see</strong>.  You can keep on describing, with little pauses for players to jump in, until a player makes a move or you see an opportunity to make another move.</p>\n<p>When <strong>the player characters go outside the bounds of what you've prepared</strong>, make something up.</p>\n<p>When <strong>the player characters try to do something that isn't covered by the rules</strong>, make a fair evaluation of the characters' abilities and their situation based on your understanding of the fictional circumstances. Describe what happens as a result.</p>\n<p>When you rule that <strong>time passes</strong>, inform the players that \u201can hour passes,\u201d or even, \u201ca month passes,\u201d in their characters' lives.  You may use this move at your discretion.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332839/#Comment_332839" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-01T21:48:32+00:00" title="July  1, 2011  9:48PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, please!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332848/#Comment_332848" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T03:12:49+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  3:12AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D written in Vincent's Apocalypse World argot? How... funky.<br/><br/>I'm interested by the differences between this onthology of D&amp;D and the way I understand the game. Would you say that this represents your true understanding of how D&amp;D rules interface with the process of play, or are you intentionally applying the Apocalypse World construction? As a reference for where I'm coming from, I'll note that in my understanding the D&amp;D rules system is almost entirely representative and realist in nature: it's not that certain actions in the fiction trigger certain pre-made rules systems, but rather that any and all activity in the fiction may or may not be interpreted in rules terms to quantify and bring the material into a gameable state as the group pleases; this process is wholly case-by-case, and the so-called "rules" in the game book are merely "common law" conventions transmitted to provide a rough basis to start with.<br/><br/>In case the distiction I'm considering here is not clear, here's the part that attracted my attention:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite><br/>As a player,<strong>describe what your character does</strong>.  If that follows under some more specific move, like if you<strong>attack an opponent with a missile weapon</strong>use that move's rules.  A few moves follow this section.  Other moves, especially those in the Action chapter, can be used by either the referee or the players, depending on the situation.<br/></blockquote>\nMy interpretation of D&amp;D is that attacking your opponent with a missile weapon does not activate the specific rule regarding that circumstance, but rather merely puts the onus on the referee (and the rest of the group as his overseers) to evaluate the action for possible need of rules application, at which point the referee chooses an implementation appropriate to the situation - maybe most of the time it's going to be by the book, but that's up to the referee, and might change as circumstances dictate. Sometimes he's going to decide that the situation doesn't require a mechanical implementation at all, sometimes he decides that the standard implementation doesn't cover the special situation, sometimes he has a better (for a given value of "better") house rule, whatever. The point is that the ontological nature of the rules-text in D&amp;D seems to me to be different from that of a game like Apocalypse World, say, which posits a duty where D&amp;D merely posits an established precedence.<br/><br/>I'm obviously not saying that this is a problem or flaw or anything, I just found the difference interesting. Do you care about how well your gloss approximates historical D&amp;D practice, or are you making something new by mixing AW with D&amp;D here? Is this even a relevant or interesting line of inquiry here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332854/#Comment_332854" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T07:33:14+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  7:33AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2011 7:33AM by Ry.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Do you care about how well your gloss approximates historical D&amp;D practice, or are you making something new by mixing AW with D&amp;D here?</blockquote>Here's where I'm coming from:<br/><br/>When I run earlier incarnations of OD&amp;D, and I override the dice or make my own rulings where rules already apply, things go wrong.  Players get annoyed - or if not annoyed, less engaged in play.   The relationship between the rules and the referee is pretty ambiguous in the text.  <br/><br/>One way to resolve that ambiguity is to put the referee over the rules; another way is to make the rules a compact that everyone buys into.  So I see what I'm doing more as collapsing that waveform in a way that wasn't apparent in 1974.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332858/#Comment_332858" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T08:27:44+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  8:27AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2011 11:17AM by Ry.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Here's chapter 2:</p>\n<h1>Chapter 2: Character Classes</h1>\n<p>There are three character classes in this game: Cleric, Fighter, and Magic-user.</p>\n<h4>Reading Character Class Tables</h4>\n<p><strong>Level:</strong> Refers to the level of experience of the character.</p>\n<p><strong>XP:</strong> This is the number of Experience Points (XP) needed to advance to this level.</p>\n<p><strong>BHB:</strong> This is the \u201cBase Hit Bonus\u201d added to the attack roll. (See Combat)</p>\n<p><strong>HD:</strong> This is the number of d6 Hit Dice at that level. Characters re-roll their HD each time they advance a level to obtain a number of hit points. (If you roll poorly, those hit points don\u2019t go down, however.)</p>\n<p><strong>ST:</strong> This is the Saving Throw number for the character trying to avoid something terrible.</p>\n<h2>The Cleric</h2>\n<p>Most Clerics have a patron deity or serve a particular religion. Ask your referee if they use a particular mythology for the campaign you\u2019re playing in.  If they don't, feel free to make up the details.</p>\n<p>You are an armored priest. You might be a sinister witch-hunter, an exorcist of demons, a shining knight of the faith, or a secret agent of the Temple hierarchy.</p>\n<p>Most of a Cleric\u2019s abilities are oriented toward healing and protecting, so Clerics tend to play a support role during combat.</p>\n<p>Clerics must use blunt weapons (club, flail, mace) and the only missile weapon they may use is oil.</p>\n<h3>Table 3: Clerical Advancement</h3>\n<pre><code>Level  XP          HD      BHB    ST\n1      0           1       +0     14\n2      1,500       2       +0     13\n3      3,000       3       +0     12\n4      6,000       3+1     +1     11\n5      12,000      4       +1     10\n6      24,000      5       +2      9\n7      48,000      6       +2      8\n8      96,000      6+1     +3      7\n9      192,000     7       +4      6\n10     384,000     8       +5      5\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Cleric Moves</h3>\n<p>Pray for Spells: When you <strong>pray for spells</strong>, you marshal divine forces, gathering them in your soul and readying yourself to channel them outward.  You may pray for any spells on the standard Cleric spell lists, using the table below to determine how many spells of each level you can prepare.  After this process is complete the spells are ready to be cast (leave some space next to the list of prepared spells so you can check them off as you cast them).  You can write the same spell on the list more than once, as long as you don't go over your limit of spells per level.

Perhaps you are a ferocious Viking raider, a roaming samurai, or a medieval knight. Whatever type of Fighter you choose to play, you will probably end up on the front lines of your adventuring party, going toe-to-toe with dragons, goblins, and evil cultists, hacking your way through them and taking the brunt of their attacks.</p>\n<p>The Fighter character is best equipped of all the character classes to dish out and absorb damage. The down-and-dirty hack and slash work is up to you.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re going to serve as the party\u2019s sword and shield, protecting the weaker party members and taking down the enemies before you. Perhaps one day they will tell legends of your battle prowess, and followers will flock to your castle stronghold\u2014where you revel in your fame, riches, and newly earned nobility. Fail, of course, and you will die\u2014just another forgotten warrior in a dangerous world.</p>\n<h3>Table 5: Fighter Advancement</h3>\n<pre><code>Level       XP              HD    BHB   ST\n1           0              1+1    +0    16\n2           2,000            2    +1    15\n3           4,000            3    +2    14\n4           8,000            4    +2    13\n5           16,000           5    +3    12\n6           32,000           6    +4    11\n7           64,000           7    +4    10\n8           128,000          8    +5    9\n9           256,000          9    +6    8\n10          512,000         10    +6    7\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Fighter Moves</h3>\n<p>Combat Machine: On your turn, when you <strong>face foes of one hit die or fewer</strong> you can make the <strong>melee attack</strong> move or <strong>missile attack</strong> move a number of times equal to your level, so long as attacking such foes is the only action you take on your turn.</p>\n<p>Fighter Saving Throws: When you <strong>roll a saving throw</strong> against death and poisons, add +1.</p>\n<p>Establish Stronghold (9th): When you <strong>build a castle</strong>, you are bestowed with the rank of \u201cBaron\u201d by the local ruler or monarch and may choose to attract a body of loyal men-at-arms who will swear fealty to you.</p>\n<h2>The Magic-user</h2>\n<p>The Magic-user is a mysterious figure, a student of arcane powers and spell casting. Usually cloaked in robes woven with mystical symbols, Magic-users can be devastating opponents. However, they are usually physically weaker than other adventuring classes, and are untrained in the use of armor and weapons.</p>\n<p>As Magic-users progress in level, they generally become the most powerful of the character classes, but at lower levels they are quite vulnerable and must be protected by the other party members. Perhaps one day, though, you will rise to such heights of power that you can build a mystically protected tower for your researches, create fabulous magic items, and scribe new formulae for hitherto unknown spells. Such arch-mages can sway the politics of kingdoms, and command respect and fear across the realms.</p>\n<p>A Magic-user owns a book of spells, which includes all of the first level magic user spells on the standard list.</p>\n<p>Magic-users can only use daggers and staves, and cannot wear armor.</p>\n<h3>Table 6: Magic-user Advancement</h3>\n<pre><code>Level     XP        HD    BHB     ST\n1         0         1     +0     15\n2         2,500     1+1   +0     14\n3         5,000     2     +0     13\n4         10,000    2+1   +0     12\n5         20,000    3     +1     11\n6         40,000    3+1   +1     10\n7         80,000    4     +2      9\n8         160,000   4+1   +2      8\n9         320,000   5     +3      7\n10        640,000   5+1   +3      6\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Magic-user Moves</h3>\n<p>Prepare Spells: When you <strong>prepare spells</strong>, you read from a spellbook, embedding magical formulas in your own mind.

Are we going to play this sometime? I'd be up for it.<br/><br/>It's hard to comment without knowing what you're going for, exactly. When you posted your rationale for some of the changes (as you just did), then it's easier to comment and/or discuss.<br/><br/>The thing about removing Attributes is that it was one of the only features that distinguished one character from another, gave you some sense of individuality and/or personality (e.g. high Wisdom and low Charisma implies a certain type of character). It's very true that in early D&amp;D... those attributes didn't do much. So it makes sense, in a way, to remove them. But with that goes a lot of "character": aside from your choice of class and equipment, what gives you any personality?<br/><br/>So, is it your intent to leave characters as "blank slates"? Do the players essentially play "themselves" in this game, using their own social skills and puzzle-solving skills in the fantasy world?<br/><br/>Another question: is it your intent to keep classes "unbalanced", i.e. where magic-users are weaker at first, but overtake other classes in power later?<br/><br/>I've been working on a game inspired by my old-school D&amp;D experiences, but based around the Sorcerer mechanic. If you'd like to take a look, I can send you a link. In many ways, it's the opposite of what you're doing here!<br/><br/>There a few really nice touches in your writeup so far, like this one:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite>Changed wording of invisibility from a hit penalty to an AC bonus.</blockquote>\nFinally, the "Action" chapter is what I think will make or break this game. So, I'm looking forward to that.<br/><br/><br/>(Oh, also: <br/><br/>I don't see much talk of experience and leveling up. How will that work? Is it not part of this document? <br/><br/>And: In "early" D&amp;D, rules about morale and henchmen, etc, were SO important. Will those be part of what you're working on here, as well, or not?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332887/#Comment_332887" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T13:07:52+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  1:07PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Putting on my Devil's advocate hat here:<br/><br/>If "player describes, referees says result" works for <i>every other conceivable action in the game</i>, why is there a combat system?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332888/#Comment_332888" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T13:21:29+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  1:21PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2011 1:33PM by Ry.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a></p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>It's very true that in early D&amp;D... those attributes didn't do much.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Oh, it's so much worse than 'not do much.'  In '74 D&amp;D, the strongest possible girl standing right in front of me is only 10% more likely to harm me than the weakest possible girl.  That's a miscue.  That strong girl should cut me in two <em>comparatively</em>, but the game doesn't respect that.  So what you do is you put this thing in the game that looks like rules, but is really basically color.  I figure, best thing to do is to leave the color as color, which is why there are blurbs about different kinds of fighters and clerics.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Do the players essentially play "themselves" in this game, using their own social skills and puzzle-solving skills in the fantasy world? <br/>\n  Another question: is it your intent to keep classes "unbalanced", i.e. where magic-users are weaker at first, but overtake other classes in power later?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>So, given my last answer, I'll answer "yes, but not because of me."

The Referee is supposed to adjudicate.  There was something of a "loyalty check modifier" in the Charisma attribute section but no guidelines on how to use it.  So that non-rule got tossed early in my process.  Then Charisma was just a horrible XP bonus and a number of hirelings modifier which really... wasn't enough to keep it.

The high roll wins initiative. Re-roll ties until there is a winner.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Party with Initiative makes its moves (one per character/monster, in any order)</li>\n<li>Party that lost Initiative makes its moves (one per character/monster, in any order)</li>\n<li>The round is complete.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Repeat until the battle is resolved.</p>\n<h3>Movement</h3>\n<p>When you <strong>move in combat</strong>, you move 12 feet per round.  This can be done while making another move, such as casting a spell or attacking in melee.  The referee may adjust this speed downward depending on the amount of equipment your character is carrying.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>run in combat</strong>, you move 24 feet per round.  This action precludes taking another move.  The Referee may adjust this speed downward depending on the amount of equipment your character is carrying.</p>\n<h3>Melee Attack</h3>\n<p>When you <strong>attack with a hand-held weapon in melee</strong> roll +Hit Bonus versus the target's Armor Class.</p>\n<p>On a hit, do your weapon's damage.</p>\n<p>On a miss, nothing.</p>\n<p>You must be within 10 feet of your target to take this action.</p>\n<h3>Missile Attack</h3>\n<p>When you <strong>attack with a missile weapon from range</strong> roll +Hit Bonus versus the target's Armor Class.</p>\n<p>On a hit, do your weapon's damage.  A natural roll of a 20 deals double damage.</p>\n<p>On a miss, nothing.  A natural roll of 1 is an automatic miss and the Referee may choose that this results in dropping a weapon or tripping.</p>\n<h4>Firing into Melee</h4>\n<p>When you <strong>fire into a melee</strong>, the Referee randomly determines which combatant will be the actual target (usually two opponents of equal size will be around a 50% chance).  Then roll to <strong>attack with a missile weapon at range</strong> on this target, as detailed above. You may not decline this roll.</p>\n<h3>Attacking Unseen Opponents</h3>\n<p>When an opponent's general location is not known (i.e. to a 5-foot square), they cannot be attacked.</p>\n<p>If an opponent is not visible, and their general location is known (i.e. to a 5-foot square), they can be attacked, but they get a +4 bonus to AC.  The AC bonus applies whether the attack is Melee or Ranged.</p>\n<p>Monsters with sensitive smell or hearing or more than six hit dice will frequently be able to detect unseen opponents within 5 feet; the Referee should determine the chance of this according to the creature concerned and the situation.</p>\n<h3>Casting a Spell</h3>\n<p>When you <strong>cast a spell</strong> you must declare you are doing so at the beginning of the combat round.  Unless otherwise noted, the spell takes effect on the caster's initiative phase.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>suffer damage while casting a spell</strong>, the spell is lost.  You lose your turn for this round.</p>\n<h3>Saving Throws</h3>\n<p>When <strong>a spell or other effect makes you roll a Saving Throw</strong> roll 1d20 vs your Saving Throw stat. If you meet or exceed that stat, you suffer the lesser effect.</p>\n<h3>Turning the Tide</h3>\n<p>When <strong>intelligent monsters face a hopeless battle</strong>, they will seek to retreat, surrender or flee, depending on their intelligence and type.  Certain monsters, such as mindless or undead creatures, are fearless and always fight to the death.</p>\n<h3>Damage and Death</h3>\n<p>When a character (or creature) <strong>is hit</strong>, the amount of damage is deducted from his hit points. When hit points reach 0 the character is unconscious.  The character can survive below zero by as many points as his level, so a 4th level character might die if he falls below -4 hit points., the character dies.</p>\n<h2>Healing</h2>\n<p>When a character <strong>binds their wounds after a battle</strong> they recover 1d4 HP. Note that the character can only recover hit points lost during this particular battle. Recovered hit points cannot exceed the uninjured maximum amount.</p>\n<p>When a character <strong>takes a full day of uninterrupted rest</strong>, they regain 1 hit point.</p>\n<p>When a character <strong>takes four weeks of uninterrupted rest</strong>, they regain full hit points regardless of how many hit points the character lost.</p>\n<h2>Negotiation and Diplomacy</h2>\n<p>When <strong>the party uses words to try to brazen past monsters</strong> whether or not this works is entirely up to the Referee. Players might use this to avert combat if the party is outmatched, or the monsters don't seem likely to be carrying much treasure.</p>\n<h2>Retirement</h2>\n<p>When you want to <strong>retire your character</strong>, ask the referee.  The Referee has the final say on how and when retirement works for the campaign.</p>\n<h2>Experience</h2>\n<p>When you <strong>slay monsters</strong> you gain experience points (XP) based on the Monster's description.</p>\n<p>When you <strong>accumulate treasure</strong> you gain experience points (XP) equal to the value of the treasure in gold pieces.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332890/#Comment_332890" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-02T13:23:21+00:00" title="July  2, 2011  1:23PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2011 1:42PM by Ry.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Posted By: John Harper<br/>\n  If "player describes, referees says result" works for<em>every other conceivable action in the game</em>, why is there a combat system?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>That's a question for Gary and Dave, I'm just here to arrange the furniture.</p>\n<p>Edit: Even better!

The implication I get from the gaps in '74 D&amp;D is not that there isn't a rule; it's that this rule exists but is left to the players to extrapolate from other rules, adopt from some other game, argue out themselves, etc. <br/><br/>I like my experience of running MA especially because it's got several different generalizable procedures for handling things - should I treat this like weapon class vs. armor class, or attribute vs. attribute, or an unresisted automatic effect - and while it's true that it's often entirely up to me which of these rules to apply, I always feel like I am applying an impartial rule as the situation befits. This is a bit of self-illusionism that, for whatever reason, makes all the difference for me between agonizing over the right judgement call vs. being ready to lay down the law and happily move on. <br/><br/>So my recommendation for a v0.2 or 0.3 would be to move in the opposite direction of taking out stats - instead provide some house rules for "you succeed if you roll under your stats on 2, 3, or 4d6", some Runequest or MA-style attribute vs. attribute tables, some AW-style things where your stats give a bonus on a bell-curve for qualified/unqualified success or failure, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335252/#Comment_335252" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-19T18:43:28+00:00" title="July 19, 2011  6:43PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2011 6:43PM by Ry.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Oh, yeah.

Because from Sword and Wizardry has tons and tons of text like how it opens</blockquote>\nInteresting, there might be more distortion because original text -&gt; old-school-renaissance translation -&gt; AW translation opens up the jaws of a triangle. I have a Word file that reformates the 3LBB's and is helpful for this kind of thing, whisper if you want the link. Here are some samples, although characteristically nothing states its intent as clearly as any modern writer would do, old-schooler or new:\n<blockquote>The section of this booklet entitled Scope will provide an idea of just how many possibilities are inherent in DUNGEONS and DRAGONS. These rules are strictly fantasy. Those wargamers who lack imagination... will not be likely to find DUNGEONS and DRAGONS to their taste. But those whose imaginations know no bounds will find that these rules are the answer to their prayers.</blockquote>\nThis emphasizes imagination and possibilities, but I find the idea that it's the rules that answer prayers significant. Here's more or less the meat of the Scope section:\n<blockquote>These rules are as complete as possible within the limitations imposed by the space. That is, they cover the major aspects of fantasy campaigns but still remain flexible. As with any other rules they are guidelines to follow in designing your own fantastic-medieval campaign. They provide the framework around which you will build a game of simplicity or tremendous complexity - your time and imagination are about the only limiting factors - the fascination of the game will tend to make participants find more and more time. We advise, however, that a campaign be begun slowly, following the steps outlined herein, so as to avoid becoming too bogged down with unfamiliar details at first. That way your campaign will build naturally, at the pace best suited to the referee and players, smoothing the way for all concerned. New details can be added and old "laws" altered so as to provide continually new and different situations. In addition, the players themselves will interact in such a way as to make the campaign variable and unique, and this is quite desirable.<br/><br/>If you are a player reading the DUNGEONS and DRAGONS rules in order to improve your situation in an existing campaign, you will find that there is a great advantage in knowing what is herein. If your referee has made changes in the rules and/or tables, simply note them in pencil (for who knows when some flux of the cosmos will make things shift once again!), and keep the rules nearby as you play. A quick check of some rule or table may bring hidden treasure or save your game "life".</blockquote>\nAnd these specific cases seem to me to start by talking about the game factors involved and then ceding the judgement of how these should be applied to the GM, not giving the GM fiat power per se:\n<blockquote>Loyalty of Non-Player Characters (Including Monsters): Men, Dwarves and Elves will serve as retainers with relative loyalty so long they receive their pay regularly, are treated fairly, are not continually exposed to extra-hazardous duty, and receive bonuses when they are taking part in some dangerous venture. Judgement of this matter is perforce subjective on the part of the campaign referee, but there is a simple guideline: When one or more of such characters are taken into service a loyalty check is made by rolling three-six-sided dice. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>Hiring Specialists and Mercenaries: In order to hire either of these classes of persons it is necessary to do one or both of the following: Post notices in conspicuous places, stating the positions open and who is offering such employ; or have servitors circulate in public places, seeking such persons as are desired. The weekly cost of either method is from 100-600 Gold Pieces. The referee must determine the probability of the success of the attempt based upon the generosity of the offer made and so on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Assassin: The role of this hireling is self-evident. The referee will decide what chance there is of his mission being accomplished by noting the precautions taken by the intended victim. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335336/#Comment_335336" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T08:55:35+00:00" title="July 20, 2011  8:55AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2011 8:57AM by Peter_Aronson.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ry</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a> T.But, no, stats in OD&amp;D aren't for the GM.

Mind you, they also tended to be used by GM as well for, as you put it, guides to player efficacy.  <br/><br/>It is also worth noting that in OD&amp;D, even in the very first edition, there were mechanical effects for charisma, constitution and dexterity, and experience bonuses (which were actually important in play) for high "prime requisites" and suggested situations for six attributes to apply.  The very first supplement, <i>Grayhawk</i>, made intelligence and strength mechanically important as well (as well as increasing the value of high dexterity).  I really think they were always supposed to have a mechanical effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335350/#Comment_335350" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T09:50:09+00:00" title="July 20, 2011  9:50AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2011 9:55AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I think one of the primary functions of "stats" was as a guide to roleplaying. Aside from "high Strength, low Charisma" the game gives a player very little to base their roleplaying of their character on. Your class choice determines this to some extent, but "stats" are the primary determiner of "who is this guy I'm playing?"<br/><br/>I wouldn't overlook the social interaction elements, either. For instance, "We need someone to carry the statue. Who's the strongest here?" Or even the joy of being able to laugh at your friend's poor decision-making because, after all, it's justified by their character's low Wisdom score (or whatever).<br/><br/>I suppose what I'm saying is that it is a part of the rules which is perhaps understated on paper (having little mechanic impact on anything else) but a very important and vital part of the experience of actual play at the table.

And what about characters that are <em>smarter</em> than the player -- is the GM supposed to help them out occasionally?).   Clever might still have some of that problem, though.  Or, you could, I suppose, define it as a matter of being clever under pressure, so it really only affects stat checks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335383/#Comment_335383" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T12:24:24+00:00" title="July 20, 2011 12:24PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I do think there are a lot of different solutions to the Character-Player intelligence problem.</p>\n<p>One time we had a character that was peak .01% intelligence in this campaign, and the 4 players would basically pause the action, talk it out together, and then restart the action.

Feel free to color your depiction of your character on the basis of the stats, but actually making bad decisions because your character is stupider than you are? That's screwing with the game, makes no sense and lets down the rest of the team. If you want to depict your character as stupid, go ahead and give your best ideas in a confounded voice and act like he accidentally stumbled on a good idea. Or tell your ideas to another player who can present them as those of his character's, while yours gives stupid advice that is roundly ignored. Your character's low Intelligence shows up in that the GM might require you to check it now and then for adverse consequences, and you can't rely on initiating checks yourself and expect it to succeed. The actual intelligence you play your character with is the same whether the character's Intelligence stat is high or low, but a high stat will help you play intelligently by allowing you to pass various knowledge, memory and abstract thinking checks that give you the tools for making good decisions.<br/><br/>I find the above straightforward with the D&amp;D mental stats, but I do admit that their names and superficial definitions encourage a thespian interpretation. For this reason I've clarified them for my own game by calling Intelligence "Education", Wisdom "Willpower" and Dexterity "Wits". They do the same things they do in standard D&amp;D (except some things traditionally done with Int are done with Wits instead), but it's much more clear to the players that the statistics do not set thespian challenges to them - the stats explicitly leave the character's personal nature open for the player, opting to describe his mental qualities as "tools" of intellect that can be depicted as challenges and limitations without requiring the player to handicap himself.<br/><br/>The above attitude does put me into diametrical opposition with some of the earliest D&amp;D philosophy, but I don't find the thespian interpretation of voluntary handicapping in the name of "good roleplaying" to be in accord with the game's overall goals. There needs to be an explicit case-by-case agreement about such an handicap to avoid descenting into plain terrorism of the adventuring party's efforts: I do think that a player may well suggest that his character might suffer some handicap in some situation ("Shouldn't I make a Con check about staying in my armor all day in this desert?"), as this helps the common cause of exploring the fiction, but the GM needs to pick that up and run with it - it's just plain weird for a player to insist unilaterally that he should act suboptimally in some situation, even when the GM is not establishing such a requirement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335417/#Comment_335417" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T16:32:09+00:00" title="July 20, 2011  4:32PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>What I'm trying to highlight is that since</p>\n<ol>\n<li>there are no ability checks in 3BB D&amp;D</li>\n<li>experience bonuses are terrible un-fun awful rules</li>\n<li>5% bonuses in pass/fail systems only help on 1 in 20 rolls of the same type (negligible in describing the span of human ability)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Stats in original D&amp;D were a tack-on unfinished subsystem that was worse than useless.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't say that for all later editions of D&amp;D (except the thing about experience bonuses by prime attribute, that's might be the most un-fun rule of the lot).</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335423/#Comment_335423" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-20T17:28:33+00:00" title="July 20, 2011  5:28PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes - to clarify, I didn't jump in to criticize the endeavour you have in this thread. (Just read my contribution and it seems like I decided to participate in your discussion about the original textual meaning of abilities, when I was just inspired to write up a few stray thoughts.) I would probably have dropped abilities myself as well if I were engaging in this somewhat bizarre textual deconstruction. As the game is written, abilities indeed are an after-thought. I strongly suspect that this is a failure of the text, though, and not the play practice behind it; it seems unnatural to me to assume that the original referees would not have used the abilities in many and varied ways in the original campaign, considering everything we know about how the game is played, what sort of creative pressures and concers are present in play and so on. That's the sort of low-hanging fruit that would be impossible to ignore in any kind of extended play, I think.<br/><br/>Ultimately the problem with this deconstruction might largely be that a purely textual approach to D&amp;D gets a really rather awful game. It would be decades before the game got any game texts sufficiently well-considered that one might seriously use a text-first approach to understanding the game. The early texts are all about getting things on paper, sifting through pre-existing play material and documenting a practice, with very little in the way of analytical thought going into it; it's easy to point to huge portions of the original texts and recognize them as nothing more than documentation of that first campaign's incidental off-the-cuff rulings, like droppings of a herd of beasts passing by. This seems bizarre to us in this age of analytical game texts that go through a phase of systematic construction on the way to book form, but I think you can't just ignore it: a deconstruction like this written out of something like <i>Sorcerer</i> would get something very close to how the game is actually played, but the same is definitely not true of the early texts nor the tradition-reliant midschool game texts. One would not be completely unjustified in deciding that the great majority of the pre-millenial rpg texts are really not very good, specifically because they fail so heavily as exact, direct descriptions of procedural systems. Not that being comprehensive and clear is the only possible virtue of a game text, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335481/#Comment_335481" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-21T07:23:39+00:00" title="July 21, 2011  7:23AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2011 7:24AM by Ry.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Eero - Yes!</p>\n<p>This Wrack &amp; Wruin exercise is about saying "yes, this awful thing is what I'm hacking."</p>\n<p>Since the text has so many gaps, my what-D&amp;D-is and your what-D&amp;D-is could so far off that it messes with our fun in a big way.
