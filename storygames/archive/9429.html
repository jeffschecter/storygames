A competitive game about new gods, growing up and pushing the old gods out of their place. You know, because there's only so much worship and 'stuff' to go around."<br/><br/>When pressed, she revealed that by "stuff" she meant something similar to what pre-4th <i>D&amp;D</i>ers might call "domains", or <i>Scion</i> players would know as "purviews"; ie., those areas in which a god has influence.<br/><br/>Based on her idea of a competitive RPG in that area, I tossed out a stock-market mechanic by which players would compete for a limited number of domains, and would have to fight over -something- in order to earn new points to use in the stock-market. Players could therefore -choose- to be cooperative and not all go for the same domains, but if the number of domains was limited, and the resources were limited, then eventually they would be forced to go for each others' throats. Also it would make for more fun.<br/><br/>I also thought it would be interesting to have some kind of oracle-system, whereby a GM could quickly toss off "OK, Thor and Hermes are both in love with the same woman, the daughter of a priestess of Isis... go!" and the players could then play in an attempt to win... well, whatever the currency of the game ends up being, by whatever means it ends up being earned.<br/><br/>That said, I tossed this off this morning:<br/><br/>Game of the Gods<br/><br/>What is the game about?<br/>Jealous Gods toying with mortals for their amusement.<br/><br/>How does the game do that?<br/>Domains of influence established by players for the setting (or if there is a setting?) with PCs able to bid on areas of influence; more influence in an area makes it more expensive, however (stock market mechanic).<br/><br/>More points earned by clever use of domains to mess with mortals? Stolen from other players? Mortal worship (sites of control, shrines, temples, sacrifices, etc.)?<br/><br/>Why is this fun?<br/>Competitive, tactical resource management without crunchy charts-and-graph-paper rules, flexible for more- or less-narrative control.

These kids want a crack at Zeus? That fucker clawed his way out of his own father's stomach and then feed him stones. Gods need that worship voodoo, its so cash, so when these newbies start coming arround your going to get a throwdown and the winner, well he's not even a god anymore, that's how serious it is. <br/><br/>The Domains is kewl, but its seems like its pointed in the wrong way. Domains (thinking mostly from the dnd example here) are how the gods deal with the world (i'm the god of death rawr) not with each other. They also need something to aim for, the big goal is getting worship, my abilities lay in death (domain) but you still need a means to get your goal besides your raw abilities it seems like. <br/><br/>that said, I really enjoy the Idea, I hope it comes out awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208976/#Comment_208976" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T11:15:23+00:00" title="May 25, 2009 11:15AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2009 11:17AM by deadlytoque.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Logos,<br/><br/>Good point. Between last night and this morning, I lost the "gods warring amongst themselves" vibe that Erin's idea initially had. From our discussion, she actually meant more competition between the players as lesser gods, but I really like the idea of trying to topple the very thrones of the universe. Zeus and his kids toppling the Titans would make a good template.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>What is the game about?<br/>Jealous Gods wresting, cajoling, seducing, and downright stealing the worship of mortals from each other to fuel their own advancement in the divine heirarchy.<br/><br/>How does the game do that?<br/>Domains of influence established by players for the setting (or if there is a setting?) with PCs able to bid on areas of influence; more influence in an area makes it more expensive, however (stock market mechanic). Gods can then use their domains to provide reward or wreak havoc in the mortal world, which either allows them to -earn- "ambrosia" or deprive the other players of it -- ambrosia being the "stuff" of mortal worship which gives gods their power (and allows them to buy into the market).<br/><br/>Ambrosia should be a limited resource. Acts of generosity or reward can inspire loving worship. Acts of terror can either inspire fearful sacrifice or simply be used to drive worship away from another god. Domains should also be limited. The smaller the available amount of ambrosia and the fewer domains, the less "godly" the gods will be, and the more cutthroat their battles.<br/><br/>Why is this fun?<br/>Competitive, tactical resource management without crunchy charts-and-graph-paper rules, flexible for more- or less-narrative control. Oracle system to encourage quick "into-the-action" play and competition.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>A new thought: perhaps what the god does to mortals will earn them different kinds of ambrosia. Loving worship gives "influence" ambrosia, which can be spent on improving domains OR on influencing other gods; fearful worship gives "pain" ambrosia, which can be spent improving domains OR on directly attacking other gods.<br/><br/>Godly conflict can then take four basic forms:<br/>1) Steal or destroy another god's worship (kill, coerce, or seduce their followers);<br/>2) Encourage your followers to wage war against the followers of another god (like 1, but less-direct);<br/>3) Use the stock market to "steal" another god's domains (gradually supplanting the god of a given domain in your pantheon);<br/>4) Direct confrontation, either through Influence or Pain (spend raw god-juice/ambrosia in directed challenge).<br/><br/><i>Edit for clarity</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208977/#Comment_208977" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T11:20:23+00:00" title="May 25, 2009 11:20AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you read "American Gods" by Neil Gaiman?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208981/#Comment_208981" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-25T11:32:16+00:00" title="May 25, 2009 11:32AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brennen,<br/><br/>Several times.

Maybe I take up Thor's hammer, but then I risk becoming a mere avatar, with mortals worshiping him through me.

OK. So maybe each Domain has a "trapping", determined by the first player to buy that Domain, and so before you can steal it from them, you not only have to pay the Ambrosia cost, you also have to roleplay something to take on the trapping. Then, once you control the domain, trapping and all, you can change the trapping to something that suits you better, although it can't be too broad a shift. Alternately, you can "brute force" it, like if you are vying for Thunder-godhood, and you built up a cult who worship you with the trapping of Spear instead of Hammer; then your cult attacks and kills the Thor worshippers, supplanting them entirely. So different strategies are available, depending on your play style and how you collect your Ambrosia.<br/><br/>Does that sound like it would work, or is it adding too much complexity? I like the idea of trappings, but I think they would be best attached to "groups of worshippers", rather than by Domain (contradicting what I said earlier; can you tell this is stream-of-consciousness?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209053/#Comment_209053" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T06:30:55+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  6:30AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Too much added complexity. <br/><br/>First the trappings dont really sync with the domains.

I think that does a lot to alleviate concerns about keeping one's gods pristine and thematic, and reflects the oddball, buffet-style domains that old European pantheon-gods tended to have. <br/>For that matter, I sat on an idea for a term paper in college that would basically compare and contrast Mega Man and the Old Testament Yahweh - if I could have found more anthro examples of YHWH specifically wielding the powers of gods He ousted/defeated, I would have written it.<br/>Kind of like "You defeated ... Ba'al Man. You got ... Harvest Gun." Imagine a little 8-bit God guy springing forth and, um, turning green and dark brown or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209639/#Comment_209639" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T22:36:42+00:00" title="May 29, 2009 10:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite>I've never heard of<i>Mythender</i>til now and from a (very brief) Internet search, it looks like it might be a dead project.

It's not an in depth analysis by any means, being a humorous story about a deity who suddenly found himself with a massive religion based on him, but no real worship, but it definitely puts out some very, very interesting ideas in this direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
