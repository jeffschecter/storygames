One or two more, and I'll give in to my Darkest Self, where I'm a dependent puppet.<br/><br/>A situation arises where I'm playing my guy, and he's alone in a car with another character he likes.  There's a lot going on in the fiction, including a somewhat urgent need to go the hospital.<br/><br/>Someone reminds me that my Sex Move removes a Dark Power string.  I'm not in the mood to be a dependent puppet anytime soon, so I say, "Sure!  Let's do it!"<br/><br/>I wasn't initially thinking in-character, "This other character is sexy, I want her," or anything like that.  It was a decision motivated entirely by the game, not the fiction.  <br/><br/>The moment where the game-advantage reared its head, I shifted out of my in-character stance to play toward my game goals.<br/><br/><b>How do you all feel when this happens, and why?</b><br/><br/>Note 1: This not an attempt at fishing for gripes or solutions, it's just a survey.  If you <i>love</i> it when that happens, awesome!

In my experience, there is usually a way to make it work, and there is usually a way to contend that it can't possibly work, and what actually happens depends largely on the player's perspective.  So feel free to include that dynamic in your responses, but I'm leaving it out of the question.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395764/#Comment_395764" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T16:10:00+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  4:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if I can answer this question, Dave!<br/><br/>As we discussed recently, I think this happens very often, in pretty much any game (even freeform/diceless play, over social issues and similar stuff).<br/><br/>So, I LOVE it when it produces something cool and even more so if everyone's excited about it. Maybe you would never have considered sleeping with that character, but the rules made you think about it... and now, wow, this game has gone in a direction you wouldn't have come up with on your own, and everyone is really enjoying this new twist! I LOVE LOVE LOVE when that happens. It's one of the main reasons I like playing different game.<br/><br/>One of the things I've always wanted to do is to play the same scenario through several times, using different game systems each time, and see how the fiction *feels* different, what decisions suddenly become weighty, how it changes our perception of what happens.<br/><br/>But if it pushes me into doing something that's LESS cool than what I would do otherwise, and I feel that the lure is so strong that I HAVE to do it, then it's no fun at all. For instance, imagine that you knew you needed to get rid of the Dark Power string before the next scene, but otherwise you had absolutely no interest in your character sleeping with that character, and even didn't like the thought of taking the character in that direction. But, man, if you don't drop that string NOW, you know your character will be totally screwed, and that's not something you want to see right now... then that pressure becomes really uncomfortable. You've got to sacrifice your character's integrity to maintain their effective agency in the story, and you're not digging it. <br/><br/>That I don't like at all.<br/><br/>Worse yet if the other players don't like it either. ("No way! Those two would never sleep together." Or maybe even, "Dude, can we keep the sex out of this game, for once? It's gross.") That sucks.<br/><br/>I don't know if I've answered your question or not!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395765/#Comment_395765" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T16:12:37+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  4:12PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I don't really feel anything about it as I sort of consider that back and forth transition to be my normal state.

I also think the gap is particularly interesting in tabletop.  In a lot of digital games, it's extremely easy to ignore the metaphor and just play the numbers and make all the efficient and optimized decisions.  But because we're playing at a table with people who potentially place a high value on the fiction, there's more tension there, which for me, is fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395767/#Comment_395767" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T16:15:34+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  4:15PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm all for that sort of thing, that's why I play games with actual rules. I often call these types of mechanical priorities that affect fictional choices "false goals"; they help me make choices that I would not otherwise have made, thus deepening my understanding of my character. My goal in the game is not <i>really</i> to preserve my character's independence by any means necessary, but taking that mechanical concern into account inspires me to make moves that would otherwise be left unmade.<br/><br/><i>Dust Devils</i> is a very clear example of how this sort of thing works: I as a player understand how the Devil mechanic in the game works, so when it is applied to my character's fictional issue, it enables that issue to have real weight in what happens in the game. This makes the fictional issue feel more real, and equating a fictional issue like say my character's alcoholism with the mechanics of the Devil gives the otherwise vague character issue real teeth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395768/#Comment_395768" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T16:29:26+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  4:29PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 4:29PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly, I feel like I am now playing a game, and what I was doing before is forgotten.<br/><br/>Which I might feel weird about after the fact if I was going somewhere with the roleplay, in a vaguely overarching way, and I derailed my own action by attending to the rules-bit.

(which is not to say that I don't ever lose myself in the moment, and in fact those are always my most memorable moments, but I always appreciate them as an author or audience rather than a participant and apparently that is not what people are allowed to mean by "immersion" in this context.

I don't see that as the rules removing primacy from the fiction, but the rules providing an unexpected suggestion for where the fiction could go.

The infernals sex-move is a really good example of that. The infernal NEVER wants their Dark Power to get five strings on them otherwise they are suddenly, painfully, mortal. The opportunity to shed strings to other characters? Awesome!<br/><br/>There are other times when similar things can get annoying. In my experience, this typically happens with systems that I don't know how to use. I've created characters who were WAAAY too powerful or WAAAY too crappy at the things I realized that I wanted to do in the fiction, and in those cases, the decisions I ended up being forced to make were unpleasant. <br/><br/>"I can't try to insult this guy because my charisma is too low, I'd better not say anything because otherwise he's going to attack me," was something I vividly remember thinking in one of my last attempts to play D&amp;D.

For example, in Fiasco, you get a positive or a negative die during a scene and should adopt the scene to that outcome, or just show that something bad will happen in the future. That's OK because it leaves a lot to interpret. Last time in Fiasco, one character was killed before the last narration in a really sad scene (in our interpretation of the spirit of Fiasco) where no one attended to his funeral. After that scene, we rolled the dice and the game said "The character rise and [something happy happens]". We couldn't just see that and had to ignore the rules.<br/><br/>Last time we played My Life With Master, the same thing happened. All throughout the session, the game system worked against us, because we didn't get how the game thought that we should take care of things. We knew that the master should die, and worked against that goal, but it was like the game system never liked any of our ideas. It ended with us ignoring the rules and starting the end scene without fulfilling the requirements.<br/><br/>Btw, I'm not talking about the immersive experience, but when you have to retcon to fit your actions into a situations - where you have to rethink all your previous action and why you did them -  instead of react to a consequence of your actions. In your example with the sex move, I would actually call it a dumb game design. Those kind of force-the-players-in-how-to-act-solutions could be smoother. And the strange thing is, that by making them smoother, the system has to be more limited. Like "Whenever you got a dark string, you can only make the sex move".<br/><br/>* "the game and me" could also be read as "the GM and me" or "the game and the group".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Terwox" title="Terwox"><img alt="Terwox" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/nSPMQ33PX1PEF.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Terwox">Terwox</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395891/#Comment_395891" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T08:15:22+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  8:15AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I like this in situations where some previous posters would not.<br/><br/>That is, if someone wants to take a fictional action in order to better position their character, having that tied to an action that generates fiction is pretty neat.  It's sort of like "Can we heal up and get all our HPs back?" -- "Only if you do this interesting thing that may have other repercussions."<br/><br/>If this ended up with "Ok we do it and I remove my string" it would be lame because it didn't achieve the goal of getting a neat bit of the narrative out of the play.  If people rolled with making it interesting, cool.  Essentially, I don't think it needs a fictional reason going into the action as motivation, but you do need fiction coming out of the action (per the OP) for it to be cool in my book.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this necessarily makes play more coherent, but I sometimes play with a mix of people who (at least a little bit) want to win or whatnot, so having rules that both "help them win" and help keep the story moving is fantastic in my mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395902/#Comment_395902" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T09:13:57+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  9:13AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>How do you all feel when this happens, and why?</b></blockquote>\nI <i>love</i> when this happens!  <br/><br/>I mean, there might be isolated times when I haven't felt that way but they're not coming to mind.
