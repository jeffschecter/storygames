It's based on improv theory, and I'm going to use this model to analyze for instance Lady Blackbird, Apocalypse World and Dungeons and Dragons.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the introduction, the first part of three. Links at the bottom. Enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_z6q1zrAK7QE/TIvPCKek58I/AAAAAAAAAFw/M1x5PlE3pJg/s1600/tfm.png" rel="nofollow"><img alt="tfms.png" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.rollspel.nu/forum/ubbthreads.php/ubb/download/Number/1022/filename/tfms.png"/></a><br/>\n<i>The Flow-er Model as illustrated by the wonderful Anders Bohlin (DeBracy)</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>In short:</b><br/>\n* Energy is the basic currency of roleplay gaming. If your game has energy, it is going somewhere, it is interesting, dynamic and involving. Simply put, energy is what makes roleplaying feel good.<br/>\n* This model identifies seven steps to cultivate this energy and bring it into a state of flow, which is what make roleplaying feel <i>great.</i><br/>\n* The model is meant to be useful for both players and game designers.<br/>\n* The model places great emphasis on <i>clarity, sense of security and sense of curiosity</i>. It stresses <i>confusion and rigidity</i> as antagonistic towards flow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore diving in, a short introduction on my assumptions in this model:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Flow</b><br/>\nFlow is psychological term for a state of total focus and immersion in what you are doing. You cease doubting and planning, you know what to do, and just do it. Performance is at it's peak, and all you need to do is to follow the momentum and your intuition, hence the term "go with the flow". Flow can be achieved in almost any task that requires concentration.   <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" rel="nofollow">The article on wikipedia</a> describes flow as a very strong experience, but remember that flow is a gradient, not a strict category - You can have both slight and enormous sensations of flow, and everything in between.<br/>\nFor this model, let's consider flow as the moment when you're immersed in the game, whether you're immersed in your character, the story or overcoming a challenge. Everyone is active and throwing out great ideas, the mood is at it's top. Simply put; roleplaying that feels great.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Interplay</b><br/>\nEnergy and flow is something that happens in play, in the group. To me, roleplaying is primarily a group process, it's what happens between the players. It is not primarily obeying, exploring or using a game book.<br/>\nWhat the game book is though, is a participant in this process, just like the other players, one that shapes this interplay. A game as written can facilitate or inspire energy, but the game book never has flow or energy in itself..<br/>\nAlso, when I refer to "players", that includes the game master. (If the game utilises a game master at all)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Play style</b><br/>\nThis model is drawn from my personal experience, it's a way for me to map out what makes roleplaying feel great. Although I feel that energy and movement is what makes roleplaying enjoyable, other people might of course emphasis other qualites of roleplaying.<br/>\nAlso, the model places a great emphasis on improv roleplaying and story games, which I feel are the kind of games that lend themselves best to flow. If you are new to improvised roleplaying, this is as good a place as any to start learning about it, and how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Improvisation and pre-planning</b><br/>\nIn my model, I draw a lot from improvisation theatre, and in a way the model is born out of my experience in both improv and roleplaying. Throughout the text I problemise and criticize the tradition of planning stories and scenarios before playing. This is not because I hate that kind of roleplaying, but because I hope to develop both the traditional and the improv style of roleplaying with my writing. My goal is to make a model that is useful for all kinds of roleplaying, that inspire and provoce development in the entire field of roleplaying games. I hope everyone can find something informative, inspiring or useful from this model.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, let's go!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://imbuildingsomething.blogspot.com/2010/09/flow-er-model-step-1-3.html" rel="nofollow">The Flow-er Model: Step 1-3</a><br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://imbuildingsomething.blogspot.com/2010/09/flow-er-model-step-4-7.html" rel="nofollow">The Flow-er Model: Step 4-7</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_293088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293088/#Comment_293088" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-12T11:46:08+00:00" title="September 12, 2010 11:46AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is simple and nice to look at; BRAVO!<br><br>(and it focus on <i>positive interplay</i>; good)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arvid" title="Arvid"><img alt="Arvid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arvid">Arvid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293101/#Comment_293101" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-12T14:26:12+00:00" title="September 12, 2010  2:26PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2010 2:26PM by Arvid.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>It is simple and nice to look at; BRAVO!<br><br>(and it focus on<i>positive interplay</i>; good)</br></br></blockquote>\nYes, isn't it pretty?

Okay, let me try to figure this out...<br><br>A "No" can add tension and add to the stakes, if you in your "No" invite to further action and agency from the players, just as you say.<br/>Just like you should use "Yes, and..." and "Yes, but...", you should use "No, and..." and "No, but..." to build on the story.<br/><br/>In improv, clarity is super-important. Everyone on stage is acting and need to recognize what the other actors are acting out, so the first step is saying "Yes, I see and recognize what you're doing in the fiction..." and the second step is building on it. This is a lot easier in roleplaying, so maybe the "Yes" does not need such emphasis.<br/><br/>In improv, a shortform story is maybe 2 or 10 minutes long, so the words success/failure are really what the story in it's whole is about - It's the finale. When the characters meet with trouble during the story, it can be understood as setbacks rather than final success/failure. Setbacks that serve to raise the risk for <i>overall</i> failure, or raises what's at stake, rather than negating the character's progress.<br/><br/>Success/failure is an a lot more fine-grain term in roleplaying games, but the principle can be carried over.<br/><br/>I can definetely imagine the PC's sending out a messenger to a local warlord to request his loyalty, only to have the messengers head sent back to them. Okay, I just said "no" to their attempt, but boy are they pissed off, or frightened. The stakes just got higher - Now honor, life and death are at stake.<br/><br/>Likewise, when you've used "No" to provoke the players, with them finally overcoming your obstacles triumphantly, I would think you built on top of their actions, actively raising stakes or encouraging their further action, rather than just saying a flat "No". (Again, based on your post)<br/><br/>So, maybe the message rather should be "Avoid saying 'No, you can't do that' unless necessary to hold a coherent and believable vision of the game world together."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293467/#Comment_293467" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T08:29:47+00:00" title="September 15, 2010  8:29AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arvid,<br/><br/>Your articles on <a href="http://imbuildingsomething.blogspot.com/2010/07/trust-is-basic-currency-of-life.html" rel="nofollow">trust as the currency of life</a> and on <a href="http://imbuildingsomething.blogspot.com/2010/08/more-on-sense-of-security-status.html" rel="nofollow">status</a> are excellent.<br/><br/>They cast light into a very important cultural problem: modern twentysomethings and thirtysomethings persist in a state of hungrily pursuing new experiences and taking on knowledge and life skills, of self-doubt, difficulty in making life decisions, and knowledge gathering.

But I don't tend to think of core brain functionality, like the brain's processing and response to olfactory information, as psychological. I think of it as physiological. And this, to me, seems the same. It's not that we're choosing neoteny. The brain is recognizing a complex, unmastered environment and persisting in its efforts to master it.<br/><br/>A cuttlefish is born with basically the knowledge and brain functionalty of an adult. The evolutionary advantage we have over cuttlefish is that we can convey knowledge and life skills to our children because their brains are born impressionable. This is a huge evolutionary advantage. It takes many thousands of years of evolution for cuttlefish to advance themselves as a species. It takes us a generation.<br/><br/>Pervasive neoteny in human society is this evolutionary advantage of the human brain being outmatched by the increased complexity of the environment.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296099/#Comment_296099" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-06T15:09:47+00:00" title="October  6, 2010  3:09PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arvid,<br/><br/>I really like this model!

Here I'm thinking of Vampire: the Masquerade, in which everyone gets super excited to do stuff that they then may or may not actually get to do in play.<br/><br/>Then on the other end there are games that stress social contract, and/or define player roles, responsibilities, and authorities in minute detail, but do nothing for Vision and Investment.  Here I'm thinking of Universalis, Land of Nodd, and Primetime Adventures except for that crucial "like a TV show" element.<br/><br/>A few games make solid efforts on all three fronts, though they seem to require different skills.  Polaris has neat roles and neat color, but isn't as clear as Universalis on the first nor as clear as Vampire on the second.<br/><br/>I completely agree with your conclusions that play can't achieve optimal smoothness without establishing expectations, authorities, and failsafes.  No small task for something as complex as making stuff up in a group with other people!  I think the latter part of your model proposes one effective way to do it, but it's far from universal.  In my mind, "Yes, and..." doesn't get you everything that other sets of authorities can get you.  Each player needs control over something, but they don't need control over everything effected by every utterance that leaves their lips on a whim.  Saying, "No, but we're still in this together," is a fine art worth cultivating, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Steps 1-3 look like an excellent checklist for both game design and convention play.  Running a good con game is largely the art of getting players excited, cohering, and clear on what they can do, quickly.  I imagine I'll be using the Flow-er Model in the future, or at least letting it inform my thinking.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_306448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306448/#Comment_306448" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T04:50:13+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  4:50AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 31, 2010 4:54AM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is something to be said on how you present the first step in your model:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arvid (on his blog)</cite>The more energy the players invest into the game, the more energy reserves it has to spend. You can invest energy by coming to the session eager to play, cook food for the other players (which builds group coherence as well!) and write little bits of in-game fiction or play reports, and prepare sessions, write scenarios, make hand-outs.<br/><br/>This is can be risky though, for if the other players do not invest as much as you do, you risk disappointment and bitterness, just as in any other relationship. </blockquote>"If the other players do not invest as much as you do" - you write, and by that I see you falling into a ditch of unwanted idealism.<br/><br/>A game where all players invest the same amount of energy is rare, very rare. And I really don't believe it is necessary for all players to invest "the same amount" of energy. What you need is for each player to invest <i>enough energy</i>, so he/she is perceived to contribute in a positive manner. If all players contribute, they are committed to the game, and by that give the game a chance to "take off" (engage them all, and possibly; go into flow).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
