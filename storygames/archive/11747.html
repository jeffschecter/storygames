Either: <br/>......you don't act (0 points)<br/>......you act and manage to win a point (-1 point, +1 point)<br/>...it is not possible to get a relative gain (i.e. stay constant while <i>everyone</i> else drops a point).<br/>......if everyone else acts (-1 each, except the player who's turn it is), then you act last (-1 point), the only way you get your point back is give fulfill both your character's (+1 point) and the turn character's needs (+1 point to the turn player). The net is that +1 turn player, +0 you, -1 everyone else.<br/>......if everyone else acts (-1 each, except the player who's turn it is), then you act last (-1 point), then deny all characters, the net is -1 for everyone.<br/>On your turn, the only control you have on the outcome is the story you tell. If you assume everyone is creative enough to use any of the options, the last actor is in total control of how many points you get on your own turn.<br/>Storytelling skill matters insofar as it may be difficult to come up with explanations for all three types of interference.<br/>The more players that act in a round, the harder it is to "stop all the other characters in the game so far".<br/>The longer the game goes one, the harder it is to "stop all the other characters in the <i>game</i> so far".<br/>On your own turn, only the option that "stops all the other characters in the game so far" from getting what they want denies you points. Otherwise you gain +1 without spending anything.<br/>If the "stop all the other characters in the <i>game</i> so far" is supposed to mean "stop all the other characters in the <i>round</i> so far", the game changes dramatically.<br/>I'm making the assumption that you cannot "buy in" with a new character on your own turn. If you can, the game changes dramatically.<br/>The game has no end condition. Being out of points means you can't act, but you don't need points on your own turn.<br/><br/>Seems to me like a real basic strategy is just to play your own turns and never act at all. This isn't really a "winning" strategy, though. I think much depends on how able you are to spin the story such that it cuts off narrative options for the others. For example, if the story is such that the last person has no choice (or cannot think of an alternative) to making your character happy, it cuts off the only choice that denies you points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard" title="Anders Nygaard"><img alt="Anders Nygaard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/404/nXX62OQ3D3YOT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard">Anders Nygaard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262419/#Comment_262419" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T03:34:07+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  3:34AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent! Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome thoughts:<br/>\n-An end condition is pretty basic. Shouldn't have left that out. (How about "the game is over when one of the players run out of points"? Adds an incentive to stop other players dropping to zero.)<br/>\n<br/>\n-The idea I started out with is that you have to get someone else to give you points; you can't win alone. But there's no mechanism for influencing that part of the game, apart from storytelling skill. (because I wanted to see what people would come up with) If I write up more than one variant, one of them needs to have a rule or instruction covering that.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Closing the mechanics on a round by changing the part you mention - "stop all the other characters in the round so far" - could be good? Would prevent a pileup of story threads, and make the storytelling challenge easier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262742/#Comment_262742" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T10:26:42+00:00" title="March 18, 2010 10:26AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2010 10:36AM by Wordman.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good, except for the phrasing of the end condition. Better might be "the game is over when a turn ends and one or more players have no more points", which I think is what you meant.<br/><br/>Even so, that might not work the way you want it to. The game already has an incentive not to act, and this adds another one. For example, consider a three player game where everyone has one point left:<br/><br/>Anna describes her character (no point change).<br/>Bryan acts (-1 point. Bryan is at zero.)<br/>Caine acts (-1 point. Cain is at zero.)<br/><br/>Now Caine can do only the following:<br/><br/>o Screw everyone (end score Anna 0, Bryan 0, Caine 0)<br/>o Mutual need fill (end score Anna 2, Bryan 0, Caine 1)<br/>o Fill Anna's need but not own (end score Anna 2, Bryan 0, Caine 0)<br/><br/>Note one thing here: the game ending is inevitable as soon as Caine acts, but it would not have been if Bryan had <i>not</i> acted. Once Bryan acts, he goes to zero. But once Caine acts, there is no way for Bryan to earn a point anymore, so the game will automatically end.<br/><br/>Also, prior to Bryan acting, both he and Caine are in the same boat. As soon as one acts, it automatically allows the other to control who wins the game. If they want the game to continue, their best move is to do nothing.<br/><br/>If they do nothing, what happens?<br/><br/>Also note, once a turn starts with the game in this situation, the only possible outcome (assuming anyone acts) is that either Anna wins, or everyone ties with zero. There is no way for Bryan or Caine to win starting from this point (again, unless they do not act).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard" title="Anders Nygaard"><img alt="Anders Nygaard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/404/nXX62OQ3D3YOT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Nygaard">Anders Nygaard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262868/#Comment_262868" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T15:30:55+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  3:30PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I've started thinking this thing needs working over from the bottom up, rather than the tweaking I have been working on.
