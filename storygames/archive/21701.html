For those not familiar, here is a brief extract from the main novel's description on Wikipedia:\n<blockquote>The novel centres around the adventures of Peter Grant, a young officer in the Metropolitan Police; who, following an unexpected encounter with a ghost, is recruited into the small branch of the Met that deals with magic and the supernatural.</blockquote>\nNot unlike the Dresden Files (although quite different in the tone), the series is set in present day, but it reveals that magic, fantastical creatures, parallel universes etc are in fact real. I have been playing with the idea of adapting this series into a RPG setting, but wanted to first check if anyone has tried that before, so we can compare notes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474747/#Comment_474747" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-14T15:35:26+00:00" title="June 14, 2018  3:35PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            why not just use dresden files RPG? or any other wainscot rpg like Unknown Armies, In Nomine, Kult, Buffy, D20 Modern?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shadowdance" title="shadowdance"><img alt="shadowdance" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/367/nVSIPCJV3ISL3.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shadowdance">shadowdance</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474748/#Comment_474748" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-14T15:58:18+00:00" title="June 14, 2018  3:58PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dresden Files might be a candidate, although it depends how adaptable the magic system is, as magic is the key here.

preparation can 'buy' off some of these dice, allowing you to ignore the lowest.<br/><br/>Character skill and specialisation also comes into play, adding more effectiveness to spells that use certain Statements or reducing the backlash, etc.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>I recall something like that being used in the Occult magic system of Orrorsh in the original <b>Torg</b> game; I don't know if they've retained it in the new edition. I'm pretty sure it must feature in some storygames somewhere... but I can't think of one right now. There's always <b>Mortal Coil</b>, which is designed for creating magic systems as you play, so as long as everyone is familiar with the <b>Rivers of London</b> and agrees to stick to that style, you should be OK.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474824/#Comment_474824" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T08:06:20+00:00" title="June 17, 2018  8:06AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also of note: <i>Magicians</i> uses a keyword-based magic system to teach a foreign language.

The obvious choice is that the PCs are all young cops dealing with the occult, just like in the stories, but you should decide up front if you're going to let anybody play a friendly ghost, or anthropomorphic river, or anything like that.  <br/><br/>As far as systems go, I think Unknown Armies would work, but an even better choice would be Witchcraft, a CJ Carella fave that runs on Unisystem and is free to download from DriveThru.  It's got a nice magic system which is pretty consistent and tons of support and would probably do everything you want with minimal houseruling.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474949/#Comment_474949" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-20T00:31:35+00:00" title="June 20, 2018 12:31AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oooh, I like Witchcraft and Armageddon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
