She is talking about Alternate Reality Games specifically, but most of it is relevant to analogue games like story gamjes as well.<br/><br/>I noted down what she said about immersion: "Gameplay is about immmersion [but] it's not about immersing yourself in a story or character or graphics or fantasy, it's actually about immersing yourself in an interactive system and your engagement with that system, and your engagement with other people playing games, that's the core focus of gameplay."<br/><br/>About games in general: "Games can be a contructive response to social problems - we could create games that try to address a social problem."<br/><br/>And lastly: "We play them because when we play we are not suffering."<br/><br/>Now, the marxist deeply embedded in my mind is slightly wary of the last quote - this means games are a potential suppressive method, but perhaps that's over-reacting.<br/><br/>Comments are welcome, also examples of story games that actually address social problems and how (Steal Away Jordan and Shock springs immediately to mind).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149963/#Comment_149963" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T05:59:26+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  5:59AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a couple:<br/><br/><i>Sign in Stranger</i> is about inter-cultural (mis)communication and living together with people who are different.<br/><br/><i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is about how people use violence, the authority of a (supposedly) moral elite, and how communities work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149965/#Comment_149965" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T06:11:24+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  6:11AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Perfect</b> RPG is about society becoming more important than the individual, and what happens to those who don't fit the plan.

I think you can address social, moral, ethical and political issues in games - sure - but I also think that in the whole you are preaching to the converted.  Despite the anecdotal evidence to the contrary, the vast majority of people I have met through gaming have been balanced, polite, remarkably self-aware individuals without any obvious prejudices to be tackled.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a problem I have for years in leftist organisations - the ability to sit in rooms and discuss how awful things are and how something simply must be done about something and how you have to understand the wrongness and then doing absolutely nothing about it in practical terms with the people who cannot see how awful things are, what must be done and ignore or perpetuate the wrongness.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, to put it simply, I cannot see a group of BNP members sitting down to a game of Grey Ranks and then shakes their heads and going 'Nazis... what were we thinking?

Sorry about that. However, based on the pullquotes/ideas from the lecture, I'm still nor sure that people are going to help make meaningful changes in anyone other than the small group of gamers (3-4 other people) who are playing the game... and those are the people who are going to be the most receptive to that change, anyway. Otherwise they probably wouldn't be your friends.<br/><br/>And that's the real problem, isn't it? That the problem isn't the people receptive to that sort of change, but the ones who absolutely won't change (racists, facists, sexual deviants, misogynists, etc)... You won't be able to change them through a game, will you? If anything, it's not going to be through a tabletop game (maybe a console game, or something?). I don't play with racists, womanizers, bigots etc (well, one dude in one of my groups is bigoted against organized religion, but that's a minor thing IMO), so if I bring them a "social/life-changing game", they're going to be receptive to it, because they're already going to be receptive to that sort of thing. It's not going to be a "jump" in behavior, more like a shuffle one foot to the left. <br/><br/>It's the people NOT receptive to positive change that we have to worry about:anti-black, anti-Jew, anti-Muslim, anti-whatever-we-don't-like-these-days, etc. And I don't think putting carry or Steal Away Jordan into game stores is going to change, or even have any opportunity to reach, some racist fuck in the Ozarks, or some frustrated young Palestinian in the Gaza Strip.<br/><br/>EDIT: Ultimately, I believe (and this is my own opinion, mind) "gaming"/"game design" won't have any more social/life changing effects that we wouldn't also see in other idle passtimes like:<br/>Scrapbooking<br/>Knitting<br/>Surfing<br/><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=GZvS8NfoX2I" rel="nofollow">Chainsaw cutting competitions</a><br/>Mah Jongg\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>Now, the marxist deeply embedded in my mind is slightly wary of the last quote - this means games are a potential suppressive method, but perhaps that's over-reacting.</blockquote>\nThat's what they are. The cold glass of vodka for the tired day-laborer after being in the factory working his body all day, has been replaced with the light-hearted session of roleplaying (or console gaming, which is far more pervasive, but it's the same effect) for the white-collar worker after using her brain all day. It's not a "tool of control" or anything like that, though.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149982/#Comment_149982" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T07:08:11+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  7:08AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ummm, I think I missed something,,, I thought the thread was asking about games that addressed social problems.

I'm mulling over a series of ideas for Malcolm Craig's upcoming 'Hot War' using the current farce in Zimbabwe as an 'inspiration' (although there is nothing inspiring about it). I think historical games can be used to put history (and therefore attitudes and politics) into a context that might be at odds with the received wisdom of the event. The ability of games to zoom in on a situation, place you in the middle and then say 'what would you do?' is a very powerful tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, one of the problems that you might face is that the player isn't the one facing the situation, rather than the character they are playing. Its almost like you need a suspension of the suspension of disbelief. For example, in my Hot War game all three players descended into quite right-wing totalitarian mindsets from the off. At least two of the three are very liberal in their views (and the third is a tory, so for the Americans in the audience, thats still left wing, right? *wink*). The characters they were playing were divorced from their own views and therefore I can see how that distance can take the impact off the personal explorative part of the game. If you play a game like this thinking 'It doesn't matter what I do, its only a game...' then you will have that disconnect from the 'learning'<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thats a very easy mindset to slot into - after all, how many times have we resorted in games to 'invade the homes of sentient beings, massacre them, steal their belongings and then return home to triumph!'?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for games, in their wider context, being used as a soporific tool to becalm the population .. you never know, you might be right? I remember being told by one of my trot college friends that he could never like football, because the popularity of the game amongst the working classes in the 1920s and 30s was cited as one of the main reasons that there was never a socialist revolution in the UK. Throughout history people have sought distractions to take their minds off the shit that is presented before them - games, especially console games - could just be this generations overwhelming 'hit' when it comes to that distraction.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150006/#Comment_150006" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-12T08:12:36+00:00" title="June 12, 2008  8:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>Hey, I don't think I typed that.</blockquote>\nOoops, sorry I was trying to quote twice (your quote, plus the one I actually quoted from the OP), and they became one bizarre super-quote.

I personally think that believing the <i>world needs to be changed for the better</i> implies the word needs saving, but I won't really get into that here.<br/><br/>The world is really just the aggregate of people.  So changing the world involves changing people: changing the way they think, they way they act, they way they treat one another.  Even if you only succeed in affecting <i>some</i> people, you've made a mark on the world!  Thus changing the world with a game doesn't mean publishing a game that is a huge success, sells millions of copies and causes people to stop exploiting the third world etc.  <br/><br/>That's just absurd.<br/><br/>But games are ART, and is anyone going to seriously deny that art has an impact on people?  If games are art, and other kinds of art have had a major impact on people's lives, then why would games not?  If anything, the impact or import of games is potentially FAR greater than other narrative arts because of the high degree of interaction one has with the art.  One does not passively read or watch an RPG.  One *participates* in an RPG; ideally, one can't be passive.  The whole process of role-playing--of assuming a persona that is consciously not one's own--is essentially an experiment in moral thinking.  For the first step in <i>being moral</i> at all is empathy, of putting yourself in another's shoes.  And this is exactly what one does when one roleplays.  Really roleplays as opposed to mere acting.<br/><br/>And of course, games in general *are* persuasive in how they go about modeling events and how they guide the player through a set of behaviours.  There is an academic field called Game Studies which examines this sort of thing.  I HIGHLY recommend that you all read at least the first chapter of <i>Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames</i> by Ian Bogost.  Although the book is about video games and not tabletop games, the theoretical framework he lays out in chapter one is applicable to any game.  You should at least read chapter one.<br/><br/>The claim is that, just as speeches employ verbal rhetoric to persuade an audience, and films and documentaries employ a visual rhetoric to the same end, so games employ "procedural rhetoric."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_150318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150318/#Comment_150318" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T00:04:40+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 12:04AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 3:10AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking aloud here:<br/><br/>Games are generally perceived to be for fun. This may have to do with us letting go in a game, immersing ourselves in an interactive system. It is conceivable that such an interactive system may be made to empower us. So games made for fun, may be made for change at the same time. It may be perceived as great fun to immerse yourself in real world politics, within the frames of a "game".<br/><br/><i>"Game": if we are gaming real world politics; is it still a <i>game</i>? Does it matter? (would not thinking of it a game, reduce the fun in it?)</i><br/><br/>Why would we like to make real world politics into fun gaming? Wouldn't that be stupid or laughable? Well, it may be conceived that way, but consider; fun is linked to the brain-centers producing our happiness-stuff. Things are "fun" due to the fact that they produce happiness. Happiness is a state with its own qualities. It makes for infectious enthusiasm (useful), more energy (useful), better social-skills (useful) and improved empathy (useful). These qualities may be decisive in relation to the solution of political problems in a positive way. Politics are very much about relations and communications, when you boil it down. So that is one reason to pruport the use of gaming techniques for political change.<br/><br/>Another reason we may want to make politics into fun gaming, or make use of gaming techniques to engage people in politics, is indeed the lack of engagement in lots of people, when it comes to politics. The lack of engagement in politics is so severe today, that it threatens the foundations of democracy; the electoral process. If the ruling organs are elected by a minority, they lose authority. Still,  more than this; the lack of engagement and lack of will to do anything with problems plaguing us or our neighbors, are as big a threat. People have a mounting feeling of being powerless in relation to both small and big issues of today. It is conceivable that we need a lot of "happiness-energy" to make a difference on war in the middle east, famine spreading in the world, pollution destroying our weather-systems, the pestilence of aids rampaging many Arfrican countries.<br/><br/>That's all fine, but how do we make <i>games </i>to change this? What gaming techniques may we use to empower ourselves? How do we relate to real world problems through a game? For sure; we must make "games" of a very different kind than we are used to. We need to change our thinking as game-designers to do that. I believe we need to make some kind of "agenda-games". And these "agenda-games" need to <i>empower the players</i>, not make them follow any premade idea of what politics they shall make. The game must let them make the politics.<br/><br/><i>"Agenda-games": games with an agenda, made to address some issue, and to make players use their energy finding solutions (or investigating alternative takes on the issue).</i><br/><br/>That's enough for now.

I can cite a number of kids who entered our CCG community site (and UK playing community) as aggressive, offensive, insulting little assholes. Many of them have now graduated college, got married, found good careers and they openly attribute part of the change in their lifestyle to the schooling that they were given on those messageboards, the examples that were made for them of the older players and the freely given aid that we provided when they had to make some difficult life choices. OK, it wasn't the actual content of the game that helped these young people develop into level-headed human beings - rather it was the community - but the exposure to that community wouldn't have come around without the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still maintain however, that if you are using the game rather than the people around the game as the agent of change, you are going to run into a number of self-omission issues. You can make the very best game ever for exploring the importance of democracy and the consequences of a disenfranchised population from their political masters BUT if the only people who play it are people who understand those concepts anyway, it's worthless. As I said, preaching to the converted.<br/>\n<br/>\nSchools have used these techniques for years. Today, as it happens, my daughters' entire school is running under Victorian rules (with optional Victorian dress as well) to illustrate their school-wide history topic. Lessons will be done in a Victorian style, games will be Victorian etc. The school has gone to great lengths to make this as realistic as possible. The 'good' kids are, I imagine, going to come away from the experience with a deeper understanding of how their lot in life has improved. The 'bad' kids however? I highly doubt that it will provide some sort of Road to Damascus moment for them where they recognise the subtle benefits of authority and discipline in learning and suddenly become less mouthy and naughty.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn essence, I don't think the answer lies in the games - moreover in the people who play the games, the atmosphere that is generated in the gameplaying communities and the standards that are held around the gaming table and beyond. I think those are far stronger factors in influencing change than the rules or the situation in a game because in essence, they have a chance of engaging where needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150482/#Comment_150482" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T10:36:16+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 10:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course games can address social problems.  Games can also be conduits through which we can express and articulate our beliefs around social problems.  To toot my own horn, <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> exists as a means to address modern social issues through a "safe" fantastic setting (which just happens to involve imperialism, crushing class and economic distinctions, conflicts between duty, honor, and pragmatism, and the ever-present "Woman Question").  <em>Sons of Liberty</em> allows players to play with historical figures and events, and the resulting games are full of interesting interactions that only happen because it's "just a game."  <em>Conquer the Horizon</em> has never resulted in a game that didn't hit social issues fast and hard, and <em>Agora</em> goes full steam into that brick wall.<br><br>In fact, I can't see how games can avoid addressing social issues, especially if you consider complete escapism (this subject is distressing, let's elide it) to be a telling response.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
