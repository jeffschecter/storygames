Or maybe not supernatural, maybe just something that's rare for a kid like being a master of martial arts or something. It always gave me the shivers whenever the kid that was getting bullied suddenly can fight back. I probably would have liked Karate kid more if I didn't have such a strong disdain for Ralph Machio.<br/><br/>As a kid, two of my favorite stories were the Nintendo Power novel for Blaster Master - where the tween protagonist embarks on journey with a mysterious (and cute) girl in their super powerful tank - and Gary Gygax's Cyborg Commando where the young adult (I think he was like 18 at the beginning of the story) gets drafted into a secret project to turn ordinary humans into powerful cyborg soldiers to do battle with the giant alien bugs that are invading the planet. There was a love interest in that book too. <br/><br/>So, for me, the exciting elements of YA fiction were the potential romance as well as the feeling of power over the things that threaten my happiness (like bullies). It was not at all about actual sex so much as female companionship and romance. Also, I was not into love triangles, sexual tension, or "finding oneself". Those seem to be themes more common to modern YA fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd" title="Jon_Shepherd"><img alt="Jon_Shepherd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/nFIK1HGFYHAN0.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon_Shepherd">Jon_Shepherd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393272/#Comment_393272" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-13T14:02:54+00:00" title="October 13, 2012  2:02PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also really important, yep.

The Uglies series in particular is excellent.<br/><br/>The thing about relationships in YA fiction is that, reflective of the age group, they are filled to the brim with hesitancy, embarrassment, and false starts.<br/><br/>There's usually a big thing (at least in the character's head) that interferes with the romance. He's a different religion. He's from a rival faction or crowd. He's a supernatural beast. He's another contestant in a blood sport tourney and I'll have to kill him to survive. You know, stuff kids face. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>If there's no big blocker, there's nothing to heroically struggle against for the sake of your romance (though often the heroic struggling is more internal and emotional, rather than external and physical - often best if it's both).<br/><br/>Having players identify the big blocker explicitly would probably be an effective RPG tool for helping those relationships feel right. And then you have to reinforce the blocker - preferably by rewarding the player when they play to it, rather than just having the GM push against them. <br/><br/>Usually the character does just as much to reinforce the blocker and assume that it's true and necessary as they do to overcome it.<br/><br/>Bella Swan fights against the notion that she is too fragile to fraternize with vampires, but then starts doing super dangerous stuff because it makes her feel closer to Edward's protective presence, which is totally stupid and self-destructive (and kind of annoying to read), but it's a perfect example of YA relationship logic.<br/><br/>So you need ways to encourage characters to make totally stupid logic jumps that the players may have difficulty understanding. I think reinforcing the blocker may be a lightweight way of helping with that.<br/><br/>(And don't just call it "the blocker". That's a dull and inelegant word. But it's the one that comes to mind at the moment.)<br/><br/>The key to the blocker is that the character believes in it at some level, even as they call it unfair and fight against it.<br/><br/>Actually, that sort of unresolved dual-mindedness is a big theme among young adults that is often reflected in YA fiction. They hate and despise the unfairness of something, but they repeatedly act in a way that reinforces the need for it. Reflecting that tension mechanically would be key in developing a YA RPG.<br/><br/>I think Monsterhearts maybe encodes it partially in the Dark Self mechanic, but I'm not sure, not having read it yet. So please correct me if I'm wrong on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
