                    I've wanted to do this for <i>ages</i>. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome, of course.
<blockquote>Darken College, Oxford<br/>September 1853<br/><br/><br/>Sir,<br/><br/>It is with pleasure, and some trepidation, that I return to our shared crucible of learning. The source of the pleasure is my discovery of a fascinating, and, I believe, hitherto unknown Blattodea; the source of the trepidation is its loss.<br/><br/>In January of this year I received a letter from Mr Bletchley, a scholar of Languages and Mythology, drawing my attention to certain Sumerian documents. These documents, he believed, were transcriptions of oral legends, from a region of Mesopotamia that now belongs to the Ottoman Empire. One legend, he informed me, described an ancient insect with telepathic powers. This insect, it was said, had lain dormant through many ages, in wait for a human host, whom it would control by entering the host's mouth. I wrote back swiftly of my interest and Bletchley permitted me to read, although not touch, the crumbling documents. Although the legends seemed fanciful to one of a scientific bent, the description of the insect provoked my interest: from that description, I hypothesised that this was a hitherto undiscovered species.<br/><br/>I will spare you the tortuous details of the organisation and funding of our expedition; I will also spare you a description of our journey to and through the Ottoman Empire. To resume, then, we were lodged in the city of Shab al-Hiri. Bletchley conversed with the natives in a language with which I am unfamiliar. Many appeared afeared and brooked no discussion. Others, however, although still fearful, warned us to abandon our pursuit of this insect. To men of our academic drive, of course, this warning served only to intensify our appetite for knowledge of this specimen, although Bletchley was visibly cowed.<br/><br/>The next morning, as day broke, we rode to the site of an abandoned archaelogical excavation, away from which we had been warned to stay. For all the daylight hours, we searched the sand-covered stones, prying into the dark corners favoured by these insects. For all those hours, we failed to find our specimen, and returned at dusk. The next day, we took a methodical approach, dividing the site into squares, as a chessboard, and searching those squares. It amused us to name the squares for their chessboard position: "I have searched King's Sevens and failed", said Bletchley, and I believe that was the last I heard him laugh.<br/><br/>On our third and final day, we arrived late, the sun being fully over the horizon on our arrival at the site. There, in Queen's Four, was our specimen, at the highest point of a tower of stones. I motioned silence to Bletchley, but none was needed, as the insect remained still on approach.  I guided it into a specimen case and it did not resist: "It is a lover of science," said I, "It is willing to help!". Bletchley did not laugh.<br/><br/>On the return voyage, Bletchley seemed withdrawn, in contrast to my celebratory mood. He would not join me for dinner on board ship and abandoned our customary game of whist, taking to the game of Patience, which he played alone. On visiting his cabin, to enquire after his health, he seemed fragile and distracted. I left him to his devices and spent a fitful night. On arrival to breakfast the following morning, the ship's captain informed me that Bletchley had taken his life.<br/><br/>Hence, I return to Darken College somewhat distracted. I am, of course, sad, for the loss of a colleague and a friend. I am, further, perplexed, since the specimen case is now empty. I am, nevertheless, elated at my discovery. I have such sketches and journals that the discovery of the specimen is only partly devalued by the loss of the insect itself. Perhaps, indeed, the insect is still with me, in my unpacked boxes and bags!<br/><br/>I venture to suggest that we all long for our moment in the sun. As our Empire expands and our influence grows, we all wish for our entry in that Empire's history books. If I may be immodest, I believe I may have secured mine. Would it be appropriate, do you think, to name the insect Blattodea Phillipa, after myself?<br/><br/>I will, of course, acquaint you with the other details of the story at High Table later this week.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>George Bathby Phillips</blockquote> </div>

                            I did a Spirit of the Century adventure based on the Roach just this weekend. That was great fun. The players finally fought the plague of roaches filling up the Pemberton campus by summoning the ancient phoenician goddes of wrath that came in the form of a plague of frogs. Suffice to say we had lots of fun mixing up the roach with ninja princesses, hypnotic doctors, and other big fun. I still yearn for two hours of rest where I can do a decent write-up. Just one note: I used the roach cards to determine the actions of the NPCs, which of course was a great influence!                        </div>
