I feel like a jerk for saying so, but I kind of assume most RPG fiction is terrible, sight-unseen. Probably because game writing is filled with people who tried to be novelists, but then decided this was easier. There's a big difference between a good technical writer and a good fiction writer, and it's much easier to find the former than the latter in this genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262449/#Comment_262449" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T07:39:23+00:00" title="March 17, 2010  7:39AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shadowrun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerry%20D.%20Grayson" title="Jerry D.

For one thing, I'll actually read it, which is not at all true of any RPG story longer than about six sentences.  And I like that microfiction has simple, modest goals -- illustrate this setting element, evoke this mood, etc. -- and sets out to accomplish those goals as quickly and seamlessly as possible, without wasting words.<br/><br/>Honestly, I've never seen the point of longer bits of fiction in a game text.  We buy these books so that we can make up our own material (characters and plots and everything), so why the fuck are they wasting pages giving me someone else's story?  I don't want it, I don't need it, and even if I did I'm not sure it'd be a good idea to give it to me:  I mean, if it's an awesome story with awesome ideas in it, now I can't actually <i>use</i> those awesome ideas without feeling like I'm ripping them off.  And if it's a crappy story, why would I want to read it at all?

We did add a few of our own, though.<br/><br/>Robin's written a little fiction for MCB describing an ongoing investigation. I suppose the main reason for this is to show what characters do and add some colour to the setting. But, writing fiction is very different to writing RPG text, and very hard.

It can be useful, though, if it adds flavor to the setting or illustrates some of the mechanics.<br/><br/>The best game fiction I've ever seen is the "flavor quotes" in the Stunt descriptions in Spirit Of The Century. These are deliberately clich\xe9d purple prose that immediately bring to mind dozens of examples from film &amp; fiction of the stunt being described. Many of these made me literally LOL upon first reading. A few examples:<br/><br/>Gift Of Tongues: \u201cAncient Martian Frang\u2019Twa dialect? I know a few phrases.\u201d<br/>Mighty Leap: \u201cHahahaha! It is too late, Jumping Jack! There\u2019s no way to cross!

I love me some decent fiction in RPGs. Micro/mini-fic or short story format, it's all good, so long as it helps flesh out the world and the feel of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nShadowrun was a big one for me. I would sometimes re-read the short story in the core books just for the hell of it. The quotes from fictional characters really helped portray the attitude of the gam (and the discussions from several of the gear books! Those were fucking awesome!) I can still flip out quotes from the various Shadowrun books at random.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhite Wolf did a good job with their fiction, too. I especially liked the slanted opinion snippets from members of each Clan about the various other Clans from Vampire.. The ongoing story, told both in fictional blurbs in each chapter, and in the examples of play from the 2nd Ed. Werewolf book were really cool, too. I especially liked the graphic novel section with fiction on one page, and rules on the mirroring page. I even bought a no-rules sourcebook that was all short stories and vignettes from the V:tM world.<br/>\n<br/>\nJake did a good job with his little chapter heading blurbs in The Riddle of Steel. They captured the pulp fantasy feel, and gave little peeks at the world of Weyrth.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot to toot anyone's horn unduly, but I really enjoyed Johnstone's micro/mini-fic from when we worked on Sexy Deadly together. They gave a respectful nod to the source material, but where they really shone was in illustrating the types of characters you might play, the relationships between them, and the various situations that may occur within your games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262637/#Comment_262637" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-17T23:16:00+00:00" title="March 17, 2010 11:16PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Oh to be honest I kind of enjoyed the fic in Unknown Armies.

They were certainly in-theme for the book, which is a good thing, but far too many of them made me cringe, which is a bad thing.<br><br>I always try and include some game fiction in my books if I can, and I've never had any complaints yet.

My favourite of my own (narcissistic I know, but still) was the stuff I did for good ol' Vanishing Point. I introduced each chapter with two or three pages of short fiction relevant to the chapter's content, but still wove them all together into one long, coherent story. It worked for me, and I get a few compliments now and then on my fiction, so I'm happy.<br><br>Most game fiction is pretty bad though. Even the White Wolf games make me cringe sometimes. I still remember reading the original Corporation RPG and finding characters with names like Tex and Kinkaid.... eeeeeurgh! I'm bad at names myself, but still! Tex! Kincaid!

It's also why I like seeing sample scenarios in game books.  The pages of stats and rules give you a set of tools to use, but it's necessarily a 'static' description.  Fiction and scenarios show all the bits in motion, so you get an idea of what should be happening in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown" title="Vasco Brown"><img alt="Vasco Brown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/720dbb7653b3d0bf450544cf2959a255.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vasco%20Brown">Vasco Brown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262919/#Comment_262919" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-19T01:54:35+00:00" title="March 19, 2010  1:54AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2010 1:56AM by Vasco Brown.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'lll second <strong>Tribe 8</strong>.

The fictional world was presented through fictional characters within its reality. It did wonders for unreliable narrator-presented material, tone, function, and structure. If anything I wish they'd given less OOC information. <br/><br/>In most White Wolf products, in comparison, there is a story at the start of the book that maybe has something to do with what the book is about. Kinda. They're rather hit and miss about actually conveying theme, and even when they do they do it almost accidentally. Some of them are actually written pretty well, but they don't do anything to sell, enforce, or structure the game. They just sort of sit there like my ultra-hot salsa at my wife's Irish family's dinner. <br/><br/>In Unknown Armies any of the micro-fictions, and the one page example characters in the 2nd ed core book, are fucking brilliant. They convey the game, they convey character, tone, story ideas, pacing, theme and about a million other things. I've run whole campaigns based off the page and a half of rumors in the core book. But the books that have stories that sit at the front of the book White Wolf style? Yea, nothing. It isn't that they're badly written, mostly they're pretty skillfully done (Stolze is the best prose writer in gaming today). But they don't sell the game for me, they don't convince me to play, they don't make me give a shit about the book. Mostly, they get skipped. <br/><br/>In Universal Brotherhood there was basically a novel that was packaged together with an adventure. I found this tolerable because the novel was really that -- it was a book to be read. It also tied together with the adventure, and gave some tone and background to it. And the cover told you that was what you were getting. I was fine with that. Maybe not the most excited I've ever been, but fine with it. Earthdawn, otoh, ended up with the same problem as White Wolf -- fiction bits floating for no good reason at the start of a book. <br/><br/>So for me its less if the fiction is good fiction or bad by some abstract aesthetic standard, and more about what it does for me in relation to the game. Games that actually use the fiction effectively and for a purpose, I like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
