The book mentions going back to Bridal Falls, so why shouldn't you play that out?  It provides a unique opportunity to shine a light on the characters in an unusual way.  And should things come to a conflict... well, we know how to resolve conflict in DitV, don't we?  Say "yes", or roll the dice.  If you stat up Bridal Falls as a proper town, you lose all of that.<br/><br/>This is just another opportunity for Dogs to be Dogs.  Not every moment of a Red Box D&amp;D game takes place in a dungeon, right?  You've got to restock your iron rations and door spikes.  You interact with the Duke and the shopkeeper, and, sometimes, things get down to swordplay.<br/><br/>Well, your Dog has to pick up a new mailbag, account to the elders and so forth.  Maybe visit some family.  Maybe help train that girl he sent here from Oak Barrel Branch.  If your GM is doing his job, there'll be times when you reach for those dice and times when you have to face down the question of escalation in a very different way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162640/#Comment_162640" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T13:05:47+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  1:05PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2008 1:06PM by James Jeffers.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never understood that the Dogs could be pronounced as "wrong" since the rules pretty much say that their decisions are always correct (with respect to the Faith).<br/><br/>I also always get tripped out trying to figure out who would disagree and why, but maybe that's part of making an interesting town.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162643/#Comment_162643" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T13:09:27+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  1:09PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the thing.

I totally read it as saying "You cannot, as GM, have GOD or any absolute moral force, say in the fiction that the Dogs are wrong or right." Others totally read it as saying "The Dogs are always right, and no one in the world can say otherwise." And still others (a shockingly large group, for some reason) think it says "The Dogs are always right, and you can't think they are wrong even OOC away from the table." <br/><br/>:;shrugs:: All I know is that in every game of Dogs I've ever GMed at least one NPC has told the Dogs they were wrong, and usually tired to shoot them for it. And in every game of Dogs I've ever played I've told one of the other players, OOCly, that their character was a) evil b) an asshole or c) broken as a human being. And it works really, really well. <br/><br/>As for the initial idea, it sounds great. I've never quite done it that formally, but there have been times during reflection fallout where the players have talked about having been back to bridal falls, having made accountings for their wrongs, and such. Some of them we even RPed out, but never had full conflicts around them. I also know Vincent once said something to the effect that Bridal Falls is just another town, and you could play a full game at temple in which the Dogs have to pass judgment over the elders on finding temple full of sin and pride. <br/><br/>Kinda makes me want to run a game in which I make the Bridal Falls "mini-supplement" a part of reflection, and have the PCs face a very small, subtle sign of trouble there that has thematic resonance with the town the Dogs just finished. (So when they've just dealt with a bad lot of polygamy, say, they ride into Bridal Falls and find out their mentor has just taken a new bride and she isn't getting along with his wife yet, but he assures them it'll be okay.) I'd like to see how long it can go before a) the Dogs take out guns at temple, and b) they decide that temple is actually the source of spiritual corruption.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162698/#Comment_162698" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-14T16:34:40+00:00" title="August 14, 2008  4:34PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the "I hope" idea, whether you use it at the Temple or as another kind of "endpoint", I think it has potential to be a good bookend with the Initiation.

Even Cardinals will occasionally argue with him, until he brings down the Papal decree and then the talking is done.<br/><br/>Actually, what the books says is "When your character is acting to preserve the faith of a branch, he or she can take whatever steps necessary and no one can justly complain. Your character acts on behalf of the King of Life; if anyone has a problem, they can take it up with him." <br/><br/>It also says "...no one's in a position to judge your character's actions but you yourself...Your character's conscience is in your hands."<br/><br/>It does not say that an NPC can't think or say you're wrong. They would be doing it "unjustly" whatever that means, but they can surely do it. It does not say that your Teachers back at Bridal Falls agree with everything you do. It really doesn't say that you're always right. It basically says no one, including the GM and other players as well as NPCs, can <i>justly </i>judge your character (save you the Player)."<br/><br/>I find it to be one of things that makes the game sing. When the fifteen year old kid defies the dogs because they are marrying off the Steward's daughter, whom he loves with all his heart. Is he a sinner who needs to be punished? Is he a kid who has lost his way? Is his love true in the sight of the King? Only the Dogs can decide, but if they shoot the kid in the middle of the street, his father's not likely to just say "Oh well, I guess Bobby was a sinner who got what he deserved. Yay, Dogs!" They may have to shoot the Dad before its over. After a few more shootings, my NPCs might start thinkin' demon worship doesn't look so bad after all.

And they ruled. Right here.  Where I am writing this. They were scary people, and torture and death penalty were very common (only a few centuries before, a Spanish Cardinal did raze to the ground my city, deported the population and salted the ground around the ruins.  Something about late payment of taxes, I think. But the people here were tough bastards and rebuild the city anyway less than twenty years after that)<br/><br/>This did not stop the people of Rome from doing a revolution and running the Pope away from the city and declaring a republic. He did return with the French army, took back the city, killed really a lot of people (some children included) in very public shows to teach people to not mess with him.<br/><br/>People continued to rebel anyway, and less than twenty years after that, this place was free from Papal domination.<br/><br/>The moral? Having a religion declaring that you are always right doesn't mean a fuck when you get people angry enough. And Dogs die as any other man.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162807/#Comment_162807" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-15T14:54:50+00:00" title="August 15, 2008  2:54PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2008 2:55PM by James Jeffers.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some one needs a nap.

And if they are going to go along with this, and that line is passed down into the stewards and their towns, and so on... you gotta be crazy to defy a Dog.<br/>Ooh! Reread the section on stewardship. In fact, the stewards at the Dogs' Temple <i>answer to the Prophets and Ancients for the actions of the Dogs</i>. Just like a Steward is subject to the Dogs' judgment for the actions of a sinner in his congregation, the Dogs' Temple is subject to the judgment of the Prophets and Ancients of the Faith for the actions of its Dogs in the field. If the Dogs are doing unconventional things, the Dogs' Temple is going to second-guess them like crazy.  <br/><br/>In the passage noclue quoted, "anyone" refers to the membership at large, not the hierarchy of the Faith above the Dogs.<br/><br/>Also worth remembering: Bridal Falls will be simply <i>lousy</i> with Dogs, former Dogs, failed Dogs, and Dogs in training.

As a GM (never been one, but I can imagine), I'd try REALLY hard to get a wedge between the Dogs--this is, in part, the point of Relationships ("Hey, wait, man--that's my Aunt Margaret you're about to shoot int he face!").<br/><br/>Also, don't forget Ceremony: I've always imagined that exorcism is the "doctrinaire" solution for possession and Sorcerers (never mind "minor" sinnin'), not summary execution. It's REAL hard to maintain a congregation if every transgression results in execution (that also puts a damper on recruitment, donchaknow).<br/><br/>As for the Dog's Stewards: that's one way for the GM to "influence" the interpretation of The Faith. Normally (i.e. out on the range and in towns), the Dog players are the "authority" on what is just and right in The Faith; the GM is encouraged to let them do that, as part of the self-discovery of DitV play. But once we start talking about the Ancients and Prophets and the Dogs' Stewards, it become part of the GM's purview: NOW, the GM can get his points in (e.g. killing is a last resort, only used after prayer and exorcism and even incarceration and "retraining"; or "children can't fully sin, not being fully aware of right and wrong"; or "Dogs can't and shouldn't dictate to non-Faithful"--which makes a nice push-pull between "don't kill all our flock" and "you have no right to tell non-faithful what to do, let alone kill them if they oppose you").<br/><br/>And never forget the Territorial Authority (or whatever they're called--I always get it wrong, it seems). They may or may not be Faithful (and, thus, under the Dogs' authority to some extent), but you can bet they've got guns (even more guns, possibly) and enough Traits to give the Dogs a tough run in a straight-up fight (being solders and often outnumbering the typical threesome of Dogs). What kind of campaign arcs could you have with the Dogs on the run from vengeful non-Faithful militias (never mind pitchfork-wielding mobs of citizens)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163632/#Comment_163632" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T08:31:27+00:00" title="August 20, 2008  8:31AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be damned sure that when they arrive in Bridal Falls City to see the Elders and the Prophets that I run it just like another town with pride and sins and a problem to be solved with a book in one hand and a pistol in the other.<br/><br/>And I would make it clear that -I- wasn't judging them, the elders and prophets were and since you are a Dog, technically, they are fucking WRONG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163638/#Comment_163638" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T08:43:30+00:00" title="August 20, 2008  8:43AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>And I would make it clear that -I- wasn't judging them, the elders and prophets were and since you are a Dog, technically, they are fucking WRONG.</blockquote>I'd like that unpacked more, because I'd always assumed that the A&amp;P were former Dogs, promoted to leadership roles.

The players' watchdogs alone sit in judgment of the world, but more importantly, the players themselves sit in judgment over their own characters.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163673/#Comment_163673" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T09:49:14+00:00" title="August 20, 2008  9:49AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua,<br/><br/>Bridal Falls would do just fine as a town, there's no reason it can't be done that way, and it would probably rock.<br/><br/>Thing is, I'm intrigued by the idea of breaking the pattern.

Trust me, what matters is judgment and sin and pride -- how many non-faithful there are in a given town and if Sydney Rigdon is being sent to Liverpool to recruit more Faithful doesn't matter very much. <br/><br/>Now, as to tossing out random ideas in my head, one of the things I was thinking about in Bridal Falls and town creation was having the Pride be a sin the Dogs committed. Like, wait until you have a town where one Dog shoots another Dog in the face (which always happens -- if Dogs can't be wrong then how come they end up butchering each other so often?) and then when they go back to Bridal falls start with the Pride: Dog who survived thinks that he is more right than another Dog. From there escalate all the way up through the ancients and elders -- have someone agree with the Dog who survived, and have them, say, refuse to pay for the funeral for the family of the other Dog because the dead Dog was doing wrong when killed. Then follow the chain as normal. <br/><br/>It could be fun, if handled sensitively and with the players rather than against them, to have the Dogs have to deal with all this sin and false doctrine in the heart of the church -- with the full knowledge that it was their own choices that started the whole mess. (Which, of course, still doesn't mean the Dog was wrong. Bad things happen from the results of righteous judgments all the time, right?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163849/#Comment_163849" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T17:03:16+00:00" title="August 20, 2008  5:03PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand, my mind is blown!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_163879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163879/#Comment_163879" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-20T18:32:40+00:00" title="August 20, 2008  6:32PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing some Dogs but with Jedi.  It's been a little off because we're having trouble getting more players, so it's been me and the GM, me and J and the GM, and me and B and the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first game (me and the GM), I had to deal with a mining dispute.  I forget the specifics, but the miners were striking and pirates were attacking.  The merchants wanted me to put an end to the labour dispute.<br/>\n<br/>\nI sided with the miners.  I struck a deal with the pirates; I offered them clemency for their piracy if they would act as a lawful navy for the miners and help us take the planet.  We kicked some ass, I had to wear a mask to hide the scars, became an enemy of the Senate, and the miners had their planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the last game we started on the big capital planet (Coruscant).  I got pulled before the Council where they threatened to kick me out of the Jedi order - "We do not interfere with politics!" "Yeah, right we don't."  The fallout: the other PC had to keep an eye on me.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a few discussions about the role of Jedi and how you know when you're doing the right thing.  Some went to dice, some didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nI offered to speak for the mining delegate who was trying to get the Senate to recognize their legitimacy.  When they crushed me in the Senate, a riot broke out and they wanted to burn down the Senate house.  I was all on that action - the Senate was obviously corrupt, the Jedi Council totally messed up.  In the end the Senate burned, and that's where we left the action.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe disappointing thing was that B seemed peeved that I wasn't acting like a Jedi should in the end.  Oh well.  Otherwise, good Dogs action.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there's some AP of a "Bridal Falls"-ish experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164022/#Comment_164022" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T09:04:18+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  9:04AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On of my favorite things to talk about is the rightness-or-not of Dogs, but Bret's the boss of me here.

Wasn't really trying to pick on you. I think you are a good guy. And from what I can tell, youhave good fun when you are gaming.<br/>\nWhat I meant was, members of the communities are born into it. Each town is like an isolated village in a fantasy setting. They have their own eco-system, etc. Sharing that space is the Territorial Authorities and the Mountain Folk. But they are not part of the community or religion, right? And from what I can gather, the xenophobic nature of these communities means they won't be recruiting.<br/>\nOf course, some areas might be exceptions, but that is my general understanding of the setting.<br/>\nI don't think there is a wrong way to play, but I was just sharing my experiences and advice for good play. I know from my own play that different groups play with different styles, so, my advice may not apply to you.

I think "Say yes or roll the dice" will suit you for these scenarios. I mean, it might work better as a no-prep moment, right? Let the players explore an area where they are not the big dogs, right? In Bridal Falls they have someone to answer to and they have a chance to do political maneuvering, etc. right?<br/>\n  I think Bridal Falls has the potential for the least formulaic encounters. I mean, there are people there that are technically equal to the Dogs (which almost never happens in a Town). Also, there are people that are superior to the Dogs (which never happens in a Town). Regardless of whether the characters are doctrinally correct, they still have to deal with someone competing with them and/or bossing them around on some level, right?<br/>\nDave M                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164369/#Comment_164369" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T08:13:57+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  8:13AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gotta say, I still LOVE the idea of a group being taken to task for doing their job. I mean, imagine you send a group of Dogs to a town and a confrontation happens between the Dogs (which, from what I hear, happens a lot). How do they explain this? How do you justify wounding/killing/defying another Dog? I can understand the idea that "If I did this in the course of fullfilling my duties, then God believes I am right," but when more than one person does the "right" thing and it brings them into conflict? To me, THAT is where role-playing hits the sweet spot.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164455/#Comment_164455" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-22T14:16:35+00:00" title="August 22, 2008  2:16PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say I've never thought being right was all its cracked up to be.
