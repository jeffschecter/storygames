I printed it out and read it and was like... I'm not sure this would really work, or would be much fun if it did.  These crazy forge games I just learned about seem like real fun, and they're totally different from this.  And I never thought about it again, for years and years.<br/><br/>And now I see it brought up once in a while on Story Games, and I'm like... people use this?  people have fun with it?  The same kind of people who dig forge-y indie RPGs?  Seems crazy, apparently true.<br/><br/>So anybody out there who's actually played out some Mythic GM Emulator...  tell me stories!  How'd it go?  What was it like?

Elliot Wilen, another SF Bay area gamer and S-G member was the only other player.<br/><br/>For my purposes, I'd rate it a pretty smashing success.<br/><br/>I brought the base scenario seed and the associated toys ( we used minisfrom my collection and terrain and table at EndGame in Oakland) and Elliot brought the system expertise ( I'd admittedly skimmed the text). We'd also brought a slew of copies of the various forms, but really didn't use much more than the two core charts (the Fate Chart and Event chart).<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Essentially, the story seed was this: </span><br/><b>Setting:</b> Lost World/Prehistoric Venus from Space:1889 <br/><b>Situation</b>: Something has been riling up the native lizardmen tribes out near the frontier between the British and German Colonies, and an intrepid band of adventurers has been sent to investigate. <br/><b>Starting point</b>: Technical difficulties cause the dirigible the adventurers were riding in to crash (naturally!) and now they have to enter the board and continue their investigation on foot.<br/><b>The Toys</b>: Various plastic Dinos and Victorian Era Jungle Explorers ( Including Teddy Roosevelet) and British Sailors, a bunch of plastic D&amp;D lizard men, trees, hills, villages and swamp from the store collection. In the second session, Lt. Lettow-Vorbeck and his German Colonial patrol arrived to join events ( they turned out to be much needed allies, incidently).<br/><br/>From that, Elliot and I roughly threw together a general table set up, picked out two miniatures each to describe in a single line who would be our individual protagonists, and we just ran with it from there.<br/><br/>We used the core Chaos Factor concept and the Focus roll guidelines to add new scenes as required. With some urging from me, we dispensed with any real combat rules and simply used the Fate chart to et answers to combat related questions just as with anything else.<br/><br/>I'll skip the details of the actual story that developed, but it was appropriately Lost World Pulpy.<br/><br/>For actual play style, the MGME is essentialy a tool-kit approach to game design. There are core elements, and then what feels like are tacked on elements that are there mostly because gamers expect them. I tended to not use that stuff, and just play it as a light system of Question-roll-answer-interpret, with either Elliot or myself pretty much able to inject a new question at any time.<br/><br/>We used the scene focus to create a puzzle, that we then just let go and spouted answers to, going with the first one that fired our imaginations.<br/><br/>In general, we played very quickly, and there seemed to be an ebb and flow to ideas/questions/interpretations. I'd be on a streak of creativity for maybe 4-5 questions ( while Elliot rated their probability and was master of cross-referencing), then my creativity would flag, and our roles would reverse.<br/><br/>It was all very natural in actual play.<br/><br/>Honestly, in those two sessions ( probably only 3 hours of actual gameplay-time), we accomplished a full blown adventure.<br/><br/>Is that helpful Ed, or did you have more specific questions. I agree that the game doesn't look like a lot to read. Or, maybe too much in some cases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/derthnada" title="derthnada"><img alt="derthnada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/derthnada">derthnada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217651/#Comment_217651" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-10T07:07:35+00:00" title="July 10, 2009  7:07AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mythic was actually the single game that was responsible for my return to roleplaying as a grown-up.  I wanted to play some of these new games I'd recently learned about, but couldn't find a group to play with.  When I discovered Mythic, I was all like, "No WAY!  Screw other people!  I don't need other people!"  The solo adventures I ran were enough to:<br/><br/>a) scratch the itch I'd been feeling to recreate my BSOLO adventures as a youth<br/>b) realize how lame those BSOLO adventures actually were<br/>c) get my creativity flowing<br/>d) allow me to test drive a lot of these new-fangled systems<br/>and perhaps most importantly,<br/>e) got me enthusiastic about the hobby again<br/><br/>That last one is important because it encouraged me to break out of my shell.  I used Mythic to start drawing my ex-gamer and non-gamer friends into "players-only" games, which seemed less intimidating and stigmatized than the trad GM-player setup.  My evangelism has won a few converts, but mostly it allowed me to get in touch with all the gamers that had been hiding under rocks all around me.  <br/><br/>So...yeah, Mythic changed my life.  <br/><br/>But enough of that.<br/><br/>As far as the emulator itself goes, I think it's pretty handy.  Like others have reported, I use it frequently even when I'm not playing a "Mythic game" per se.  What I find elegant is that it has both a strict binary yes/no component, complete with weighting for situational considerations, as well as a new age-y "put these two random words together, and surprise yourself with the outcome" component.  So...you get answers from one, and questions from the other, in a sense.  Leveraging the human tendency to find connections and patterns is what makes the second one work (and work really well, in my experience), and IMO, is more useful than a tome of rules and/or plot points.<br/><br/>As time has worn on, I find myself using the principles more than the thing itself, but I simply can't NOT recommend it.  It's cheap, and even if it doesn't change <b>your</b> life, it's at least a tool in the box.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217813/#Comment_217813" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-11T14:57:03+00:00" title="July 11, 2009  2:57PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys!

Basically, he's covered the experience very well and I know it took some major restraint against "let me tell you about our adventure", because, honestly? The adventure was very, very cool. We played it loose, weren't afraid to go with the first reasonable idea to pop into our heads, even if it was horribly clich\xe9, often because it was horribly clich\xe9.<br/><br/>I was definitely the more critical player and I was slipping a bit into "GM mode" at times, really because in many cases I was a stickler for procedure. But the game system worked because the procedures give you an out: at times the obvious thing doesn't happen, and sometimes the system tells you (essentially) to think of something extreme and go with that. For some reason the epitome of the whole mix, for me, was when the weird interdimensional interloper, who was secretly controlling the lizard men, tried to use his mind control powers on Riley the dirigible pilot. Result: Exceptional Failure. Question: since Riley, as a stereotypical Victorian Irishman (apologies) was always semi-inebriated, did the creature get stoned by the psychic backwash? Result: Yes!<br/><br/>Other parts of the mechanics encourage introducing new "threads" to the situation and/or moving toward their resolution. This helps keep the scenario from being one-dimensional.<br/><br/>I could definitely use this game in the future. My personal preference if there's a bunch of players would be to step more into the GM/facilitator role, especially if the group isn't too cohesive at the start, also because I feel someone needs to move things along and decide when to use common sense and when to put matters to the system. I should point out that although Robert &amp; I divvied up the characters at the start, we rapidly fell into co-managing the entire episode and pretty much lost track of who belonged to whom. That worked well with two participants who were pretty much on the same wavelength, not sure if it would if you had more players. So, again, a clearer formal division of roles might be helpful.<br/><br/>This relates to a rules issue; if I recall correctly, the game's "fate point"-type system is per-character. We didn't actually use the points much, probably because we tended not to have dice rolls that could destroy the scenario. In any case, the per-character approach is hard to manage and I'd go with per-player instead, especially when character ownership is fluid.<br/><br/>Another issue, and this relates to my being the more critical player: the game works on principles of common sense both for deciding when to roll and for setting target numbers (essentially). This led to minor difficulties as Robert tended to go for "Highly Likely" based on genre expectations or general coolness; I tended to look more for objective rationales. But again, it didn't matter much because the dice had the final say.<br/><br/>Getting back to uses of the game, I could also definitely see this being used in the recommended fashion as an adjunct to other systems. Say you enjoy the mechanics of Game X, as far as they go, but you find it burdensome to GM the types of scenarios you like because there's not enough help in deciding "what happens next" in arbitrary situations, and you dislike "GM decides" because it's too pat. Well, Mythic both answers the either-or type question and as noted above, it tells you when something extreme or unrelated occurs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217847/#Comment_217847" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-12T07:44:27+00:00" title="July 12, 2009  7:44AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>We played it loose, weren't afraid to go with the first reasonable idea to pop into our heads, even if it was horribly clich\xe9, often because it was horribly clich\xe9.</blockquote>\nI think there is something to be said for cliches, especially when starting out with a system/setting.

It's also of very rough quality although I liked a picture or two.<br/><br/>We did use the fate point system a little but it's easy to forget. Basically you get a rather large pool of points which can be directly applied to any die roll, including after the dice have hit the table. Since these are d% though, you could easily burn your points quickly. IIRC there were also times when the characters earned points but it was hard to manage given how we were playing, and also a bit redundant given the way we were already collaboratively framing questions. In a setup with more centralized GMing, the points would be more relevant IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
