                    Hey all, I'm a big fan of systems that contain some mechanism where players get a reroll every now and then. I wanted to get a list of a few of these mechanics, and good/bad points of each.<br/><br/>Force Points: You get them by following the guidelines of the Force and succeeding in adventures.  You spend one beforehand, and you can double your die roll. Good = It's like a die explosion of pure power, which is awesome. <br/><br/>"Eberron Points" (I forget the name): Each one you spend gives you an extra 1d6, which you can add to a standard 1d20 roll. Good = player gets a boost without forcing bizarre or system-breaking results.<br/><br/>Other systems (for die pools)<br/><br/>Spend a point, reroll one of your dice.<br/>Spend a point, reroll all of your dice.<br/>Spend a point, add a die to the pool (before or after you roll them).<br/>Spend a point, take one of the dice and change it to its highest face.<br/><br/>Questions for the crowd:<br/><br/>1 Have you added a hero/fate point system to a game that didn't inherently have one? What were the results?<br/><br/>2 Have you played a game that had a hero/fate system built in that just didn't seem to work with your group? Why didn't it work?<br/><br/>3 The players get these Hero Points somehow ("End of session for succeeding in goals; end of session for Good Roleplaying; In the middle of session for entertaining the other players; In the middle of a session for following some mandate on your character sheet" etc). Which methods work for you and your players, or don't work for you and your players? (maybe one 'good', one 'bad')<br/><br/>4 What are your general thoughts on these mechanical widgets that let players change their dice rolls?  <br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            The reroll/bonus component of these is far less important to me than the social component. As a currency of reward (either in a gm to player or a player to player dynamic) they are one of the most meaningful ways to say "That, right there, was cool".<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Well, that's assuming that the reward mechanism is "Give out the points when the player does something cool". A lot of mainstream games like Savage Worlds, Star Wars d6 and the like primarily reward the player when their character "completes missions/scenarios" and the like.<br/><br/>So indirectly you're saying that the systems that work for your group are the ones that reward players for doing cool things, right? :-)                        </div>

                            1) No.<br/><br/>2) I ran KULT for my early group of friends, and it didn't always work.  Sometimes it broke the coherency, the mood, or the purpose of the fate points.  Though the point where it really broke down was not the mechanics' fault: we played a one-shot in which the three characters were Irish terrorists.  They took over an office building and fought off the police (i.e., the "collaborators with the Occupiers").  Without the other two players knowing, the third character was a mole.  When he betrayed them, led them into an ambush, and put a gun to his "friend's" head, the victim's player used fate points to reduce the damage from lethal to a scratch.  That was a point of social contract breakdown, I think, because it was an act of player defiance, but the ability to do this brought the whole game to a screeching halt at a point where it would have been cool and dramatic, in the fiction, if the guy had died at the hands of the mole.  But even without the player issues, having the points meant that the character was not in mortal danger in that moment unless I overrode the use as a GM.  So basically, KULT is supposed to be a very dangerous and lethal game, but piling up fate points takes a lot of that out of the equation.  That can be countered by GM, but I found that that was yet another burden on me.<br/><br/>3) It depends on the type of game.  In KULT, we figured out that having more than a couple of points destroys the mood.  That means awarding them during the game doesn't work well.  I awarded them at the beginning of the "adventure" so that the players knew how to ration them.  I also always gave everyone equal amounts based on the idea that that was fair; they all would get the same chance of survival.  <br/><br/>4) I am a big proponent of "positioning" dice/points.  I could have handled it better in my early years.  I think that for various styles of play, these points allow the players to both indicate what's important to them, avoid deprotagonization, give tactical options, and enable one or more players/GMs to, as Rob said, reward cool play.  But the amount and usefulness needs to also fit the mood of the game: many in cinematic games, few in dangerous/creepy games.<br/><br/>I also strongly propose the use of the points or tokens as a guaranteed improvement, contrary to how they're used most of the time in Iron Heroes.                        </div>

<p>I once hacked one into Exalted (when you get stunt dice, you can bank the dice to use later, and spend up to 10 stored stunt dice on any single roll). Group didn't particularly care or use the mechanic much at all - when it mattered to them, they were pushing harder and getting stunt dice anyway.</p>
<p>So, after some thought, I realised that for my group, these abstract resource mechanics that let you push something that matters to you were not as good as something like augmenting in HQ, where you do something <em>with description attached</em> that pushes harder.</p>
<p>Thinking about where they come from - I'm really unhappy with Mark's 'lube' thing (to me it feels like an attempt to repair a technique that is generally not fun); I like fanmail-style awards a lot. It's not particularly interesting or useful to me to get session-end rewards; I like them to flow in play, to immediately flag whatever is cool.</p>

                            They're done well in the new version of Paranoia. They're called Perversity Points and the GM gives them out in typical Paranoia style, slightly randomly (to create player suspicion), deliberately unfairly, but basically to reward good play. (The new version of Paranoia is very explicit that players should be treated as puppies and given treats when they're good.)<br/><br/>Can we count Breaking The Ice, where you give bonus dice, which add to the die pool? In that game, they're used to reward <i>narration that you like</i> or <i>stuff you find attractive</i>, so they're a tool to give the other player feedback on narration.<br/><br/>I like them. (I don't think I've got any useful answers to your specific questions, though.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

I was trying to say it pretty directly, but yes. Though I must underscore that it's not just t  ecool things, it's the implicit recogonition of currency changing hands which is, yes, not the only workable model.  I mean, I dig the pure utility of the fixed resource systems, like Eberron or the World of Darkness, but that's purely a check against the idea that the dice betraying you at the wrong moment is not fun.  I appreciate that need, but it's not an exciting solution.  Swap it so those points are flowing in for a social(that's cool!) rather than a purely mechanical (Gain X every level, or perhaps get one willpower back per day)  and Im happy again, though I also recognize that in doing so, I'm revealing that I place the social element of play over the mechanical, and am potentially a bad panda. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob  D.                        </div>

                            I'm a big fan of these types of mechanics. <br/><br/>1) Way back in my illusionism days, I added a point system to my Dark*Matter Alternity game that gave the players points they could use to get flashes of intuition, hunches, and other hints during the investigation by asking me a "Yes-No" question that I had to answer honestly. Looking back, this was basically a cover for the problem of failing forensics rolls and not knowing what to do to keep the story moving, but the players seemed to enjoy the ability to step outside the normal resolution system and just discover something cool with their creative questioning. It was by no means a perfect fix, but it solved the problem of botched rolls well for us at the time.<br/><br/>2) I've really only had positive experiences with such mechanics.<br/><br/>3) I like a combination of gaining these points as social reinforcement and as a result of smart play in using the mechanics to the best advantage. I definitely prefer games where there is a steady flow of such points, rather than only receiving them in clumps at the end of an adventure or when leveling up. The clumping tends to lead to hoarding behavior and using the points only in emergencies in my experience, instead of using the points for enhanced kewl when the time is right for it.<br/><br/>4) Again, I love them. My current design project, "The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries," is basically inspired by the old Hogshead Game <i>The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen</i> with liberal doses of extra crunch in the form of many ways of using Acclaim points to alter your dice rolls (each kind of alteration requiring certain types of narration in your tale). <br/><br/>One issue with such systems is that the points often have various uses. For example, Heroquest using the points to alter rolls and improve your character over time. Such tensions in the various uses seem to bother a lot of people who assert they can fray the system and create weird incentives for the players to do things the designer didn't expect. I personally don't see it as such a problem, so I'll let others weigh in on that issue if they like.                        </div>

                            I love <em>PTA</em> Fanmail.  I really dislike <em>7th Sea</em> uh... Hero Dice, I think?  I'll call them Swashbuckle Dice.  Your Swashbuckle Dice were opportunities to be awesome or to earn XP, but not both.  If you decided to be awesome in the game, your character didn't advance and far, and that sucked.  More importantly, though, the benefit that you could get from using Swashbuckle Dice were relatively minor, and did not change results very often.  And that just sucks.  If I'm spending Be-Awesome currency, I want to actually be awesome, not get a slightly better chance of success.  This is why I like Fanmail, which provides a pretty potent boost to your chances.  Someone upthread talked about how sometimes bonus dice broke the system and considered that a bad thing; on the contrary, I <em>want</em> bonus dice to break the system, because that means that I, as a player, can break the system when it's important to me to do so.                        </div>

                            Drama Dice, Josh. And they could be effective, but only in limited situations (where you could do a stack overflow to add radically to your kept dice, or if you had the right traits). <br/><br/>Hero Points in HQ work mostly well, except that I've always had the problem with them that Josh had with 7th Sea DDs - you can either use them to advance or to do well in the game. Do one and you can't do the other. Now Mike will come on and tell you why that is a good thing with many good reasons, but I still fucking hate it. <br/><br/>One of the more successful HP games I've run recently has been Truth &amp; Justice. It gives you points for being awesome, for supporting the other players, for playing to genre, and as "lube." The thing about the "lube" part is the way my group played it the players would often demand that I screw them (its an actual game mechanic in T&amp;J called "Revolting Development") in order to get points when they wanted them. So it became less lube like and more an issue of players deciding when they wanted to lose to up the drama. That way was nice. The "lube" part... well... it was more mixed in its results.                        </div>

                            Rob, <br/><br/>Yep, MAX management becomes an important part of the game. The one issue that can happen is if you (early on before you know better) sell your MAX down to much in can result in lots of those lovely HPs going down the can and players playing for small rewards in terms of HP (those they can maximize use for) and avoiding the bigger and chancier (and thus more interesting) payouts because they know they can't use them.                        </div>

                            I like games that have Hero Points because they facillitate drift.<br/>
<br/>
Take M&amp;M, for instance.  It's true that, as written, Hero Points in M&amp;M are there to be "participation lube", but I've never used them as such.  In fact, when I first started playing with the Philly group, one of the players complained, "I *want* difficult plot developments and setbacks to happen to me.  You shouldn't have to pretend to be guilty about it," and we nixed them right there.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, we used Hero Points much the way Restrictions in Nobilis (or, as it turns out, Aspect Compels in FATE) are designed to work:  I would introduce characters' Complications in such a way to further the story I wanted and pay the players off for it, or the players would introduce their own Complications and point out that they should get rewarded for them.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between what I was doing as an M&amp;M GM and what (I think) the game text expects the GM to be doing is just that there was no pre-set narrative or path of scenes.  If I brought in a character's crippled aunt, fear of spiders or fondness for moonshine it was all about making <i>this scene, right now</i> more complicated and challenging, not about steering PCs back towards "the story".<br/>
<br/>
I <i>did</i> also give out HP to give the villains extra oomph, but that's mainly because M&amp;M characters can have rather a glass jaw without the ability to reroll the occasional save now and again, and IMHO players don't like the feeling of easy victories.  For GMs who think that such a method is too transparent, it's also easy to give the villains points up-front (as M&amp;M 1st edition did) or use the Villain's Luck Feat to build in extra points (effectively "resources", "toughness", "luck" and "story oomph") as part of a villain up-front.<br/>
<br/>
My point:  M&amp;M Hero Points don't need to be about participationism <i>unless that's your favoured playstyle</i>.  When I ran 7th Sea the Drama Dice weren't really about "lube" either.  They were much more about rewarding "teh awesome", and/or greasing players' palms for building characters with entertaining flaws which made for denser, richer, more entangle story -- right now.                        </div>

                            Well, it's hard to argue with hate. But I'll try anyhow. Here's the problem. If you don't have an alternate use for Hero Points, then the only disincentive you have to using one in a situation is that you might want it later. This is what I hate. Because it's really no control at all. Not knowing what the GM is going to throw at you later, and whether or not it'll be important, you really don't know whether or not to save them. So the only real criteria is some "average" interest of the current situation. Making the question of whether or not to spend really rather invariable. There's really no question being asked to answer.<br/>
<br/>
For me, in games like this, I feel as though I might as well roll a die to determine if I spend the point. It's just a further randomizer in the process, not part of player participation. Can't count the number of times I've either "run out early" or didn't spend any points at all waiting for the exciting stuff to come. That's fine itself - I like "wallowing" effects and such. It's just that when it happens it feels meaningless. What did I give up to get where I am?<br/>
<br/>
With something else to spend HP on, I now have another constraint to consider. "Damn, I'm hoping to buy into that new grimoire soon, but it would be cool to win this contest. Which do I choose?"<br/>
<br/>
This makes HP spending, for me at least, a real choice each and every time it comes up. Not that I harangue about it or something, but every HP spent is a statement of how important this contest is to me. Not vis a vis what other contests "could" happen, but vis a vis using the HP instead to indicate some character growth.<br/>
<br/>
This also means that it works best when HP are in good supply, because it's a more balanced choice to choose between "spend a lot on something" or "spend less" and the contest at hand. If, in fact, you're burning through all of your HP every session, yeah, that's a bummer that the character can't grow at all. It should be more of a question of "how much win" vs "how much grow," not a binary selection.<br/>
<br/>
HQ ain't perfect here, too, I'll admit. I'm sure a better system can be built. But it's got enough complexity of design that the spending of points is relatively meaningful.<br/>
<br/>
FP from FATE actually have an alternate side, their use as "GM Points." While I don't like to limit players this way personally, I do like the fact that at least there's some choice with a FP to either use it to engineer victory, or engineer events. So you can allow your character to fail, say, but use an FP to make the failure very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, one more cool things about HP in HQ. Sometimes they have a potentially cool effect, and at other times they don't depending on the vagaries of the die roll. This is cool because, since you spend the HP after the fact, you get to guage when it's "effective" to do so. So you never get the situation where you spend the point and it fizzles, and yet having a HP on hand is no garuntee that you'll be able to force the situation to be what you want.<br/>
<br/>
This is a problem, too. In some games you always have points on hand, and they can always allow you to win. Meaning that the die roll is "Do I win, or do I have to choose to win or lose?" I find it preferable that you don't know this going into a roll.<br/>

                            Interesting points, Mike.  But I don't see how having two options for spending HP solves the issue of whether to spend it in any particular situation.  You're still facing the "average interest" issue, only now you add the issue of whether it'd pay off to invest the point in development instead.  That is, this issue:<br><br><i>Not knowing what the GM is going to throw at you later, and whether or not it'll be important, you really don't know whether or not to save them.</i><br><br>doesn't go away.  You still don't know if more interesting stuff will come up later.  You're just making it less likely that they'll be spent.  You're narrowing the range of situations which are "important" enough for you to spend the point, but you're not changing the basic dilemma.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            No, see you're making my point for me. The problem is that I don't have a decision to make, because I don't have enough data from which to make it. So the "now or later", as a question I can't answer, is not valuable.<br/>
<br/>
For example, let's say there's a game where you can choose what's behind door number one, or door number two. Well, that's a question in theory, but the end result of which door I select is, for me, random (Shroedinger would say it's actually random). So there's no information to react to, no data from which to make my decision. So it's not an interesting question. I just select one to get the process going, and move on.<br/>
<br/>
I don't care about the question.<br/>
<br/>
Now, actually with a RPG there could be data. Uh, it's early in the adventure, so maybe later the decisions will be more important. But it's still largely an unimportant question to me. Just not enough data for me to feel like I'm doing more than random guessing.<br/>
<br/>
If I add in the question of whether or not to spend this point, or to hold it to spend on X advancement, now I'm comparing the current situation to the value of that advancement. Which is a lot more data, to me, and makes the decision feel like it has weight. I'm interested again. I'm participating in a meaningful way.<br/>
<br/>
Any better? We're taking a case of a non-decision, and adding a real decision to it.<br/>

                            But in that case, aren't you advocating always using the points for advancement?  If not, what other consideration did you introduce that would make using the points for bumps now less of a non-question than before?  How is it that you could not evaluate the decision of spending a point now rather than later, but you can evaluate spending it now rather than later or on advancement?<br><br>Secondly, there's plenty of absolute data on which to base a decision.  You're talking about relative data--might the point be better used later?  But the absolute data of the current situation indicates, is THIS right here, right now, important enough to spend a point?  You are actually making a statement each time you use a point.  Sure, you can't formulate a perfect rational interest self-maximizing strategy because of the unknown element that is future challenges, but I don't think you can say that people never fail in a roll and think, "This here is worth spending my point on right now."                        </br></br></div>

<br/>
Good point.  I'm gonna cautiously say that I think a number of systems do address this concern already though.<br/>
<br/>
F'rex, returning to Mutants &amp; Masterminds, a Hero Point can be spent to:<br/>
* Re-roll a d20, adding +10 to the result if it's below 11 (ie. guaranteeing a result in the 11-20 range, which is often an auto-success, but not always)<br/>
* Use one of your powers in an abnormal way as a "power stunt" for the rest of the scene.  (You can do this automatically, although you'll have to roll as normal to see if your new power use does its thing or not.)<br/>
* Perform minor plot editing -- introducing an NPC or other "dramatic editing".  This just works.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, in HeroQuest you're almost always getting something from your Hero Point:<br/>
* A bump in a contest may not guarantee victory, but at the very least it will reduce your level of Defeat by one whole category, which is significant in and of itself.<br/>
* Adding to your Ability scores is obviously something you can keep and is automatically successful.<br/>
* Adding new Abilities, particularly relationships and other stuff, just happens and gives a pretty nice mechanical boost right there.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't think Hero Points should be "magic bullets" that let you auto-succeed.  In games where using them bears a very heavy cost (say Doom in Conspiracy of Shadows, or Paul Czege's new Niche system) then I think that's neat, but otherwise they just generate uncertainty which == boredom to me.  My personal preference is that they are generally useful, help make things less bad, and give me a decent shot at success without just guaranteeing it.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, my big beef with the Cinematic Unisystem games is that the effect of Drama Points is so great that there might as well not be another system underlying them.  If I'm fighting a Big Bad who has N drama points and is committed to using them in this fight (let's say it's the season finale) then I either<br/>
* have N or more drama points of my own, in which case I negate their effects and the fight plays out just like we didn't have them<br/>
* have less than N drama points, or choose not to spend them for some reason, in which case I am in a world of hurt and open to things like x5 damage attacks<br/>
<br/>
... all of which comes from the fact that in a game where stats and skills range from 1-5 (okay, a bit more for supernatural beasties, but still) a +10 bonus is just <i>too much</i>.  It's like M.A.D.  -- if you "go drama" then I've got to match you or else you can pull out a decapitation attack and still have a net +5 to your d10 roll, making it a virtual certainty.  Which means that (to my mind) the Drama Points overpower the system, rather than gracefully integrating with it.<br/>
<br/>

                            An example of what I am talking about w/r/t CineUni:<br/>
<br/>
<i>Buffy is swordfighting with Angel at the end of Season 2.  Their stats are:<br/>
<br/>
Buffy: Dex 9 + Getting Medieval 8 = Sword Attack +17, base damage 32.  101 Life Points.<br/>
<br/>
Angel: Dex 8 + Getting Medieval 8 = Sword Attack +16, base damage 36.  94 Life Points.<br/>
<br/>
The GM is using the rule for NPCs where they auto-score '6' on all their rolls and only the PCs roll.</i><br/>
<br/>
Round 1.<br/>
<br/>
GM: Angel goes first.  He moves to drive his sword through Buffy's heart.  That's a "decapitation" attack, meaning he takes a -5 penalty to hit and does x 5 damage if he does so.  He's spending a Drama point (10) + sword (16) -(5) for decapitation +(6) die roll = 27.<br/>
<br/>
Buffy's player: Ouch.  So what are my options?<br/>
<br/>
GM: Well, you have Sword +17.  You could just roll the die.  If you get a 10 then you parried okay.<br/>
<br/>
Player: And ... if I get a 1-9 ...?<br/>
<br/>
GM: Well you take 36x 5 = 180 points of damage and die instantly.<br/>
<br/>
Player:  Okay.  I'll spend a Drama point.  So what do I have to roll?<br/>
<br/>
GM: Oh, nothing.  Your Drama point gives you an automatic +10 to your roll, so you totally succeed.<br/>
<br/>
Player:  Whew.  Okay, I guess I'll try that too.  I'm totally going to sword-stab him through the heart.  I'll spend a Drama Point.<br/>
<br/>
GM: Great.  You're rolling sword (+17) - (5) for decap attack + (10) for your drama point = 22 + your die roll.<br/>
<br/>
Player: Cool, I roll a 9.  That's a total of 31.  Take that, Angelus!  I do ... um ... 160 points of damage.<br/>
<br/>
GM: Um.  Okay.  His defense is (16+6=) 22.  So I guess he'll spend a Drama Point.  That bumps him to 32.  So he parries.<br/>
<br/>
Player:  Okay.  Say ... how many drama points does he have, anyway?<br/>
<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>
<br/>
Now, admittedly, I'm looking at the built-in "nuclear option" here with the rules for decapitation attacks.  But those rules just highlight my underlying problem.  With relatively equally matched opponents, the game might as well not *have* Unisystem running underneath.<br/>
<br/>
GM: Angelus attacks!  (pushes forward a token)<br/>
Player: Buffy rolls to the side of his blow!  (pushes forward a token of her own)<br/>
Player:  Then she leaps to her feet and drives her sword straight for his cheatin' heart.  (pushes forward a second token)<br/>
GM: Okay, at the last minute Angelus parries.  (pushes forward a token)<br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, yeah.  There's a little bit of reducto ad absurdum going on here, I'll cop to that.  But this is basically my problem with Drama Points in Cinematic Unisystem.                        </div>

                            Robert, <br><br>Ironically, that fact combined with the way some of my players dislike randomness in general has lead to us playing several games (Cin Uni, PDQ, others I'm forgetting) as token games -- killing the dice completely.                        </br></br></div>

                            Hi Brand,<br/>
<br/>
That's pretty interesting.  It sounds like a smart move -- just nail the parts of the system that are hanging flaccid and toss them away in favour of concentrating on where the action is.<br/>
<br/>
My question for you is: <i>Is CineUni still a good game if you do this?</i> or, to put it another way, what Techniques have you guys evolved to help it play smoothly as a token-only game?  Because my big worry is that with the Unisystem rules "off" what's left over might not be enough of a game for me to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
So how do you do it?                        </div>

                            Robert, <br><br>Drift, drift, drift. <br><br>We stopped playing the game as a game where you got your juice from having a fight to one where you got your juice from having to decide if it was worth losing your boyfriend later to win this fight now. (After it was over I realized it'd become very much like Nobilis -- the currency worked in a very similar way.) I suppose we moved the game to being more directly about what the players wanted, rather than what the characters could do, in terms of ability to author.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I dig it, Brand.  Sounds like that was a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
But, at the risk of being a jerk, I want to draw a clear line between the kind of drift you're talking about applying to CineUni here and the kind of drift I was talking about applying to Mutants &amp; Masterminds earlier in this thread.<br/>
<br/>
You're basically talking about drifting CineUni to (what appears to me to be) a whole new system which your group developed yourselves.<br/>
<br/>
I talked earlier about drifting M&amp;M by not playing in a Participationist style and encouraging players to trigger their own Complications when they felt they needed Hero Points.  Otherwise, we played everything by the book.<br/>
<br/>
To my (admittedly rigid, limited) way of thinking that illustrates that M&amp;M has a better "hero point" mechanic (for my play style):  I didn't need to rewrite the rules, just change a little bit of the emphasis on their application.  Whereas I <i>would</i> need to rewrite CineUni before I could sit down and enjoy it for campaign play.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm.  Sorry if this represents a divergence from this thread's intended direction.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Ahrens</cite>Personally, I don't think Hero Points should be "magic bullets" that let you auto-succeed.  In games where using them bears a very heavy cost (say Doom in Conspiracy of Shadows, or Paul Czege's new Niche system) then I think that's neat, but otherwise they just generate uncertainty which == boredom to me.  My personal preference is that they are generally useful, help make things less bad, and give me a decent shot at success without just guaranteeing it.<br><br>For instance, my big beef with the Cinematic Unisystem games is that the effect of Drama Points is so great that there might as well not be another system underlying them.</br></br></blockquote>
I noticed that same problem(feature?) with unisystem - it's like the regular dice-driven system is only what we use when nobody spends a drama point.  And the weight of the system's detail is kind of wonky because of that.<br><br>But anyway.  Regarding slver bulletness, that's not exactly what I had in mind.  Just that failing despite investing yourself in success should be <i>different</i> to just failing any old roll.  Maybe something as simple as getting narration rights for the failure, or just getting your investment returned.  There's probably funkier possiblities too.                        </br></br></div>

                            I don't, in general, like hero/fate points unless they are somehow tied to the theme. Luck Points in, say, Warhammer are a fringe thing - they are kind of tied in to the gritty fantasy feeling of the game; you can get out from some situation with luck, but your luck is going to run out. And you can see it happening. Flipping and flopping rolls in Unknown Armies is also kind of fitting because they are tied with the meaning of things and the nature of Magick. You do something, a ritual, as a symbolic action and it gives your character and edge. With Hero Points, I'd like to have a reasoning of why a character suddenly has a greater change of doing something big or succeeding because of a past success. If there's a justification ("you're feeling self-confident, you know you can handle this one as well"), it's good, if it fits to the theme.<br><br>Without ties to the theme, the points tend to become irrelevant in our group. Players don't really know what to do with them since they don't understand (or rather, want to understand) why they got them in the first place.<br><br>I dislike such points as means to reward a player for doing something; they are usually just pavlovian mechanism used to encourage a certain kind of player behaviour with a superficial tie to what's happening in the fiction. I have a problem with a lot of Pulp genre games because they tend to have a lot of these mechanics are a still tied to the over-the-top -theme. On the same note; handing out experience points or whatnot based on how a player performed, and the straight out rating players with such systems, is right out.                        </br></br></br></br></div>
