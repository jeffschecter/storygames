This topic is to address one interesting bit that I actually have implemented with success in my games. <br/><br/>I've never really had to work the "No Jerry Lewis 'Chinaman Impressions, please!" at the table, because most folks I've gamed with find it equally as abhorrent. I also don't specifically say, "No puppies will be boiled in this game, that's DEFINITELY a LINE for me, guys!" and so on.<br/><br/>But hey, in gaming with strangers, it has happened once or twice. It's usually disarmed right away with a "DUDE. SERIOUSLY." Applied with the same impact and force of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNA8JbnKU94" rel="nofollow">Cesar Millan</a> "TSST!"/ear flick. Breaking the mood like that has... (remembering) yeah, always ended that sort of thing: Sheepish apology, "No problem", re-description, game back on track. Cultural dumbness averted.<br/><br/>So how do you use immersive moonspeak at the table?<br/><br/>* Substitution: Todd mentioned in a whisper that one of the players, after fumbling with well-meaning ching-chong'ing (boo!), started to basically speak in Spanish to the other players when the character (the Chinese bride) spoke in Chinese. <br/>I've never done that: I speak Japanese and a little German, Russian. I never thought of speaking in one of these languages to convey the feel of someone speaking to you in yet another language... but it seems more respectful.<br/><br/>Here's some that I've actually done, usually with Japanese or Chinese characters: Most of them involve stepping back the "true immersion" in order to quickly convey something usually in third person.<br/><br/>ONE PERSON ONLY SPEAKS ANOTHER LANGUAGE<br/><br/>* "I'm talking to you earnestly, waving my arms because it's a crisis, and of course you don't understand me."<br/>* Same, with a die-roll mechanic: "I'm talking to you earnestly, waving my arms because it's a crisis, and...<br/>[ROLL]<br/>"...oh, it looks like you got a partial success. You pick out that I'm talking about a Crisis, in town, involving our mutual friend Cyrus. But you can't quite get anything beyond that."<br/><br/>MANY CHARACTERS SPEAK THE SAME ASIAN LANGUAGE<br/><br/>* Ancient Old Proverb Man<br/>So at my table, if you want to play the role of the proverb-spitting wise master (hell a trope in asian stories as well), you don't squint, you don't talk like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRCsSrnz90s" rel="nofollow">Jerry Lewis</a> or whatever. You can drop real proverbs. You can make up proverbs. That still obeys the trope without Going There.<br/>Another option on the same front:<br/>"I relay a common proverb from our own remote village that involves... uh... birds? That basically means 'Don't disobey your elders unless you are sure you are in the right.' It's one that these guards won't understand, but you and I do."<br/>Okay! Maybe not as good as knowing real proverbs, but many proverbs on the net are bullshit* anyway. If you can learn some real ones in prep for a long game, great! I'll drop fanmail or give you bonuses for authenticity. But that length is not needed.<br/><br/>* Actual Speaking<br/>I don't know a lot about Chinese, although I do know that there are several names for people in power (their given name, their public name, their "throne name", their polite name used about them after their death, etc).<br/>Japanese has several forms of speech. Friendly, Plain, Polite, Humble, and basically Super-Humble (this last one only in like samurai settings and the like, not used today). There's even side-forms of speech, like "Yakuza-speak" which has its own words and even grammar. It's really very interesting. But no one is going to learn graduate school level Japanese in order to play 5 sessions of L5R.<br/>But people at my J-themed games get the "forms of speech" 20 second spiel, above.<br/><br/>So in my games, the players pretty much default to their character types, and don't have to keep track of what they say to whom, it's assumed that they do it properly to form: When they speak to a lord, they don't roll, they simply use Humble Speak without declaration. If they want to give an impassioned speech inviting battle with an enemy to a lord's council, and the character is a lowly merchant or squire or something, they'd roll.<br/><br/>But if they want to do something Telling or out of the ordinary, then they describe using another form of the language.<br/><br/>* "My samurai... well, you don't know if it's just because he's drunk, or because he's indicating something, but he's talking to you very friendly-like. Not using polite form, like he always does in public."<br/><br/>* "Menou addresses the children using Humble speak. They're probably very confused, perhaps can barely understand, right?"<br/>"Yep. No one ever talks to kids using Humble speak. They actually start to laugh at you, in a warm and friendly way though."<br/>"Cool. I don't pick up on it, because Menou's never left the palace. She keeps using the most humble language she knows."<br/><br/>* "Jasper stops talking in broken speak like a typical foreigner when you come out of the restroom stall: "Seriously, you have to shut the fuck up about that company, or something's going to happen to you. Got it, Hiroyuki?" It really freaks you out, actually, because not only is he speaking fluent Japanese, he's got a perfect Yakuza accent. He's obviously been running with them for years."<br/><br/>CONCLUSIONS<br/><br/>So, those are a few of the ways that for campaigns modern and ancient, using foreign (most notably asian, since that's where all the shitty stereotyping usually comes from) accents or playing in foreign-seeped settings, we can utilize language to great gaming effect (either as background or as tools of immersion) without resorting to "pretending to speak a language that you don't know" aka "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zulEMWj3sVA" rel="nofollow">Ching-chong Ting-tong Ling-long</a>".<br/><br/>If others have had success with real table techniques, I'd love to hear about it. Please post!<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* Remind me to tell you about my experience researching "Common Japanese proverbs" linked and relinked all over the net, for annotation/Kanji in John Wick's "Blood and Honor".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327892/#Comment_327892" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T20:32:30+00:00" title="June  5, 2011  8:32PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One aspect that's hard for many people is foreign names.  When I play stuff involving China, I tend to push people to go ahead and "translate" the names into English, except maybe for surnames.  So you have a character who's like: "Ox-Strong Lu" or "Elegant Hua."  That's a lot easier for most folks than "Lu Zhongniu" or "Hua Xiuqing."  <br/><br/>And then I also try to stick with common surnames that people already know how to pronounce in English. "Han" or "Lu" or "Li" or "Huang" or "Ren" or "Wen."  Nobody is named "Qiu" or even "Zhang" (one of the commonest surnames). Yeah, it's limiting, but most Americans don't realize that "Liu" and "Lu" are pronounced very differently. Likewise "Zang" and "Zhang." Or even that "Beijing" is pronounced exactly like it looks, with a hard J.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327899/#Comment_327899" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-05T21:51:48+00:00" title="June  5, 2011  9:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the name tips, that's pretty cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327926/#Comment_327926" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T05:26:09+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  5:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a "Red Dawn" Soviet occupation game with a guy who spoke fluent Polish once - whenever we'd interact with the hated communists he'd bust it out.

I feel like sometimes making small allowances for other players' suspension of disbelief is important and, when it comes to Chinese, it takes a little more for my disbelief to not be raging, but I try to take on some of that burden so it's not the other players' problem more than it has to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/edheil" title="edheil"><img alt="edheil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/edheil">edheil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327946/#Comment_327946" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T07:59:31+00:00" title="June  6, 2011  7:59AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best solution is to insist that all of your games are set in an alternate Earth, where all languages but English -- even European ones -- actually sound like "Ching Chong Ting Tong."

We don't have ANY Asian accents in that game. I think the NPC's sometimes sound vaguely accented, but again this is more that "you're traveling the world so people here sound this way and people over here sound that other way" thing. I mean, the Asian stereotypes are there to a certain extent, we are basically in a Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon fantasy samurai ninja demon world (which, when you're playing games like that, have problems of their own on the basis of setting alone). But we prefer to start with the stereotype and go deeper, delving more into personality than race when it comes to accents. I'm tough, so I speak loudly. I'm conniving, so I speak trickily. The accent is sometimes there just for flavor. I don't do a Japanese accent despite the fact that my character is a Japanese style General with Japanese armor who comes from a Feudal Japanese area and has an old grandmother she plays Go with. But I DO speak with confidence and authority in my tone, which I think is more important than an accent in any case.<br/><br/>My friend who's running our Halo is actually an excellent character actor, and he did this AMAZING Chinese American accent for this woman npc recently that we had to question about terrorism. He was so good at it that we were paying less attention to the accent and more attention to what a ballsy operative she was. I think that's the sweet spot you wanna hit.

Basically he's doing the "as a player I'm choosing to have my character misunderstand what you just said and interpret it incorrectly" thing as his primary humor angle, which works whenever you have cultural differences between characters, whether those differences involve an accent or not. Plus, he's very much a, what do you call it, Japophile? He has learned some Japanese and is reasonably well read on Japanese culture, both modern pop culture and older mythology. So he's obviously dripping with respect as a player, even as he uses his character for culture-driven comedy.<br/><br/>I think respect is central to the whole thing. If you respect the culture you are portraying (or pseudo-culture) then it comes out in your portrayal. If you don't have much of an understanding of that culture, then that will show and will likely come across as disrespectful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_327994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327994/#Comment_327994" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T10:47:15+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 10:47AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. I once played a Vietnamese woman named Mrs. Lam. She was married to an American. When we played, I spoke Norwegian with a random fake Vietnamese accent based on a woman I once met. I was pretty sure it would be a disaster, but it seemed to work - for us four white Norwegian guys around the table. I didn't speak gibberish, but the accent was pretty annoying.<br/><br/>Mrs. Lam was a selfish woman, or you could call her a survivor, from a very poor background; I don't think she, herself, even knew if she was a gold digger or really in love with her (deceased) rich American husband. She was bossy. She hit on young men. <br/><br/>I think I based her on a lot of different stereotypes, and in the mix got something that seemed like a real person. <br/><br/>2. When people roleplay, sometimes they play vikings. Sometimes these vikings are aggressive, stupid and drunken barbarians with horned helmets. Maybe that means these players are stealing my culture, ridiculing my ancestors, and ignorantly portraying my country in a negative light. Or maybe it just means they don't have any idea what they're doing, and they don't really care. I'm guessing, without any statistics to base it on, that a lot of Chinese would think the same about people portraying Chinese stereotypes. But maybe not if they were living in a country where the Chinese were a minority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327996/#Comment_327996" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T10:56:05+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 10:56AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 11:06AM by Andy.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>Matthijs, as best I understand, it is about avoiding insulting, hyper-stereotyped gibberish speak.</blockquote>\nYep.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I'm missing some cultural context here. Is this about avoiding racism/Asian stereotypes?</blockquote>\nYeah. Not sure about your-abouts, but here in the US, when there is Asian RPG Playing going on, sometimes racism/stereotyping raises its head. People doing "fake Chinese/Japanese accents" mainly because they have seen it on TV, less so because they think it's funny (typical "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.")<br/><br/>Also, recently, we've been more sensitive to it due to big dumb stuff, usually involving the catchphrase "Ching Chong" (see Rosie O'Donnell and "Ching Chong Ding Dong DANNY DEVITO"). Which goes back to basically shitty racist Hollywood of the 40s-60s where the Chinese stereotype was played up (see the Jerry Lewis clip above): Basically like blackface, but with Chinese instead of black people. At the time it was more China than other asian countries (save for war posters you might see about Japan from the WWII era). So to make a long, complicated history short, basically if someone squints their eyes and talks like a Hollywood 'Chinaman from the 50s or uses "fakey Chinese language", most folks in the know would react just as pained as if they were watching a white person dance around in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface" rel="nofollow">vaudville-era blackface</a>.<br/><br/>I'm sure Europe and other countries have a different take on the issue. For example, in Japan, you can easily do a "Chinese person accent of a Chinese person speaking Japanese" in an inoffensive way. But you can also do a "Comically Chinese person accent speaking Japanese" in an unrealistic and a more-or-less offensive way (basically add "-aru" to sentences, something which Japanese people know Chinese people don't actually say, but are unsure where it started).<br/><br/>Anyway, in US, it's bad. There's too much real baggage and real history behind it.<br/><br/>Like, if I was to do a "stuffy German banker accent in English", or a "French poet at a cafe", or a "British gentry at a garden party", "Scottish dwarves on the cannon squad", no one really would bat an eye even if ridiculous. But for other countries with history of real racism and especially Hollywood culture exploitation (Black, Chinese) the game is much different. Is there anything like that in your country, out of curiosity?<br/><br/>EDIT: As I understand it from my French friends, it may be the case that *Polish* people might fall into this category in France? Based on lots of recent political rhetoric portraying the biggest thread to French economy being the (non-unionized, skilled, and foreign) Polish Plumber. Their equivalent of our Chinese factory worker or South American day-laborer.<br/><br/>So in the end, it's not just "country/culture stereotyping", and not just "avoiding ridiculous accent", it's avoiding both when the culture in question is a minefield of exploitation and historic racism, while still leaving it open for gaming possibility. (ex, few would say, "It's racist to try to roleplay Chinese people during the Three Kingdoms era", but pretty much everyone would say "It would be racist to roleplay Chinese people during the Three Kingdoms era while speaking in ridiculous "Jerry Lewis" accents and squinting our eyes a lot." There are a couple of cultures that would have this over it, including African cultures, possibly South American. Seems like a minefield, but that's Hollywood's fucking legacy (plus political policy, wars, etc).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328001/#Comment_328001" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T11:08:44+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 11:08AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 11:25AM by Matthijs.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, yeah.

It's more like someone will complain that they paid a fortune for a plumbing job and it was an half-assed job anyway. Then they would add "I should have hired a Polish plumber on the black market, it would have taken half the time, been done correctly and I wouldn't have paid stupid taxes in the process." More typical of the insulting accent/poor syntax was how French people used to imitate Romanian beggars you meet in public transport. I heard that one a lot in the 90s and I'm ashamed to admit I imitated the silly voice a few times too.<br/><br/>Now Andy tell me what you think of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA8IB65hseU" rel="nofollow">this</a>. You don't need to watch a lot of it, you'll probably get the hang of it pretty quick. It's just a compilation of many small parts of a comic tv show where Omar is pretending to be this guys with a caricatural francophone African accent while singing popular radio songs (popular in France obviously). Omar probably can pull this off because his family background is African. But it could be seen as insulting since he's not African per se (he was born in France and I guess he's making fun of his relatives' accent). It's interesting how in France quite a few comics make fun of accents provided they belong to the community they're making fun of. A great example was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_V%C3%A9rit%C3%A9_si_je_mens_!" rel="nofollow">La verite si je mens</a> where a lot of Sepharad and Ashkenhazi Jew accent were played out by Jew actors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328017/#Comment_328017" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T12:14:15+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 12:14PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 12:23PM by Andy.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

That's a lot easier for most folks than "Lu Zhongniu" or "Hua Xiuqing."</blockquote>\nThis is also great advice, Jonathan. <br/><br/>I have played/run Chinese themed games, and even though I write names down, put imaginary faces to names etc I still get confused sometimes, so in most cases I've done just that as per your advice. <br/><br/>Also: Modern games with using a Hong Kong style of English first names with Chinese last names (Donnie Yen, Michelle Yeoh etc), never have a problem there.<br/><br/>Luckily, Japanese has a nickname effect for memorable characters. "Magobei the Snake", "Hanzo the Razor", "Kawakami Juugoro the Blue Blade" might just be called "Blue Blade", etc. Ancient noblewomen were known outside their families only by poetic names: "Lady of the Drunken Moon" (Oborotsuki no Kimi), "Lady of Purple", "Lade of the Sorrowful Flute", etc.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, some of the Japanese RPGs I love that are set in a modern/future setting also used codenames or nicknames, even though it's really not common at all in modern society (Doublecross, a dark conspiracy supers game; Tokyo Nova, a futuristic cyberpunk Japan-themed game): " 'Nightengale' Akutsu Sayuri", "Tanaka 'Sycophant' Masaaki", etc.That's made it very easy to remember who is who with such long/unnatural-to-English-speakers names.<br/><br/>I've also used the Stan Lee alliterative effect of first and last name starting with the same letter: Hashizume Hiroko, Tanaka Tashiro, etc. That helped the names stick in the players' minds (everyone from my L5R game remembers the devious 'Hashizume Hiroko', although not as 'Hashizume' or 'Hiroko' but only as 'Hashizume Hiroko' due to the alliteration).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: anansigirl</cite>I don't do a Japanese accent despite the fact that my character is a Japanese style General with Japanese armor who comes from a Feudal Japanese area and has an old grandmother she plays Go with.</blockquote>\nExcellent.<br/><br/>A friend whispered me about the L5R game at Origins he played at where one of the players talked basically like a movie Japanese person the entire session. On an Immersion scale, a reminder would have been good that "We are all Japanese(fantasy analogue) as well, so you sound normal to us..."<br/><br/>If I were running the game, I probably would have stopped the game briefly to say that in the nicest way possible. If it would have happened again, I would have said, "Okay, since you speak differently from the rest, you must be a foreigner. We'll change your name to Robert Adams although everyone calls you Rasen Anjin, and you joined the Lion clan after having washed up on the shore after your ship passed through a typhoon. Since you weren't raised with the pressure and diligence of your peers, you drop all circles by one down to a minimum score of one." Or just would have concluded the session in Japanese to that player, doing the "Japanese samurai" accent /while speaking Japanese/ any time he tried to express himself.

One of the players played a quasi-stereotypical Chinese tea shop owner named Ping. Ping, however, was really funny because he played up the stereotypical qualities of what Westerners expected from Chinese people during the early 20th century while maintaining a strong undercurrent of condescension. The accent was slight and the full-on mixture of obsequiousness and derision was awesome and hilarious. We all loved Ping. The other slot that got filled, though, got filled by a player who basically did the whole "Ah so! Me cook cat for you!" routine. I just goggled at him from across the table. "A_______," I said to him, totally grinding the story to a halt, "I'm Chinese." He smiled and nodded and just didn't get what i was upset about. I was given the opportunity later in the session to just kill him off (there was a gunfight with Chinese cultists and the players were GROSSLY outnumbered) and I took it. I don't know if that was the right answer (though in CoC killing the characters is arguably never the wrong answer), but I didn't want to devote any more game time to explicitly laying out why I was personally offended by his portrayal of my ancestors. His next character was a stuffy Brit and that worked much better (though the accent was still risible).<br/><br/>I totally agree that it's all about respect. Ping, though stereotypical was playing his laughs off the rest of the Western characters, while the other Chinaman (whose name I don't even remember) could have come straight out of a Klan pamphlet.<br/><br/>(FYI, all of A______'s foreigners come off just as grossly insulting, but he's not a bad guy. I think he'd actually be deeply hurt if anyone implied he was racist; he just has no idea how his characters come off and can't comprehend why we're taken aback when he tries to portray an American Indian who says "How." These days we just pre-defuse the situation by limiting (or eliminating) his opportunities to play other races/nationalities.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328020/#Comment_328020" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T12:20:47+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 12:20PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 12:22PM by Andy.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite>Now Andy tell me what you think of<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA8IB65hseU" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</blockquote>\nEr, I'd rather not play "Hey is this racist or not?" here, it's faaaaar out of the scope of this directed discussion of avoiding potentially offensive foreign language at the Gaming Table.

Like she was immune to belittling in this way.</blockquote>\nPeople tend to find racial (or other) stereotyping/slurs/whatever offensive if and only if they think there is some real way they may suffer harm (physical, social, economic) because of their race/ethnicity.<br/><br/>White people in America are almost never in danger of suffering harm because of their race, so anti-white insults tend to provoke laughter rather than offense.  This would change if you put a white person in a context where they thought they *could* suffer because of their race; if a white person was desperately hoping for a position in an organization, and they thought they might not make it because of diversity commitments on the organization's part, and they overheard people of other races on the search committee using one of the few available white ethnic slurs, which they'd usually laugh off, they'd get very bent out of shape very quickly. Similarly: white guy, alone at night in a high-crime minority neighborhood, the white guy fears being attacked; if he sees a bunch of tough-looking young men pass him and utter an ethnic slur, he's not likely to laugh it off.<br/><br/>So yeah, what I'm saying is that the likeliness you'll be able to laugh off an offensive ethnic slur or stereotype is inversely proportional to how likely you feel it is that you will actually suffer harm because of your identity.<br/><br/>The comedian Louis CK talks about this in a bit called "white people" where he talks about all the wonderful advantages he gets by being white: "You can't even hurt my feelings!  What are you going to do, call me a 'Cracker'?  [in a mock-wounded voice] 'Oh, that hurts, you shouldn't have called me that; it takes me back to the days when people like me owned land, and other people...'"<br/><br/>This is basically an elaboration of what Andy was saying about some stereotypes being more charged with ability to wound than others.  You are still treated differently for being Black or Asian in the U.S.; people can still mistreat you because of those things.  In *very* recent history, you could be horribly mistreated for those things (lynchings in the South; internment in concentration camps in the West).  Until those things are long gone in the past, this will be an area where you can cause people pain.<br/><br/>That's why this is something worth worrying about in those cases, where it might not be worth worrying about in others (offending Scandanavians with Viking stereotypes is comparatively unlikely).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Buckley" title="Sean Buckley"><img alt="Sean Buckley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/9/b/c/c/member_12459884.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Buckley">Sean Buckley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328279/#Comment_328279" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T15:11:56+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  3:11PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've witnessed several Fiasco games at conventions in the UK that featured heavy use of 'American' accents. It made me cringe a bit, but the games were going well and people seemed to be having a good time. I wouldn't have been very comfortable in those games, and my refusal to 'do the voice' would probably have spoiled other peoples fun a bit.  I remember it feeling awkward when we played Deadlands with only half of the cowboys talking the talk.<br/><br/>I once spent an entire Chrstmas speaking in a dreadful Scouse accent with a small disintegrating group of friends. We all hid behind it because we were so uncomfortable showing anything real. It went on for days.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how much an accent really brings to a game, but I think it reduces subtlety and vocabulary, and increases the cliche factor.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about this a lot recently as I am going to be involved in organising Fiasco sessions in a shop next month.

My current D&amp;D campaign especially seems to have a lot of this, gypsies and goblins and whatever talking in nonsense syllables and with arbitrary accents. I think I also know why it doesn't bother me there: when I GM a game like D&amp;D I don't usually perceive the communication at the table to be about the objective in-game reality, but rather about the perceptions of the player characters. There is nothing more appropriate to driving home the stylistical themes of the game than to gloss foreign languages into vague gibberish when the communication about the game content is overwhelmingly about private character perceptions, anyway. It's not the GM's racist parody you're being given, it's your character's actual, often very parochial, viewpoint.<br/><br/>In fact, for a game like D&amp;D where passing information from the character viewpoint is a great big part of the game, it's definitely a technique I support and recommend to gloss a lot of the character observations into a more vague and less photo-realistic image of the world. It's simply more interesting for the game's challenges when instead of saying that "17 stirges attack you" you merely say "a bunch of stirges are flying around, one of them flies up in your face and tries to bite". In this particular context dingdong-languages don't seem ridiculous at all to me: your character is a stranger in a strange land, he's meeting some fearsome, inscrutable natives, he can't parse their speech and it's all dingdongdingdong to him. It's a perfectly appropriate way of passing on limited information, as the player can still sort of pick up hints about the content of the communication from your non-verbal cues, the length of the "speech", recognized names in the midsts of the babbling and so on. A language minigame of sorts.<br/><br/>I should also say that doing the dingdong thing is not entirely trivial when you have to do lots of different languages. Even for these purposes it sounds quite stupid if you don't have enough of a language-like pattern to your random babbling, and then the syllables start repeating in an annoyingly unlanguage-like manner. I'm not a very conscientious GM, so I don't practice this or whatever, but I do sometimes improve my expression with difficult languages by constructing my dingdong-ese by reading the syllables out of a phonebook or similar in the appropriate language. I notice that especially in fantasy contests, when I don't do something like this, all of my babbling starts sounding vaguely German sooner or later for some reason; keeping a list of random Chinese words or whatever nearby keeps my syllabary and accent properly flavoured.<br/><br/>I can appreciate that if the game runs on a different communication mode where the players are supposed to share an undiluted view of reality with each other, then simply making less of an effort in maintaining verisimiltude in this one thing is going to be jarring. In a game like that (a more "story game" game, if you'd like, as it's less concerned with character perspective and more concerned about shared, firm fiction) I don't even attempt to fake a language I don't know well, but will rather just tell the other players what is happening, just like I would for anything else that's not direct dialogue. "The Chinaman babbles at you excitedly, but you can't make out what he's saying" is a much more stylish choice most of the time than getting randomly thespianic about describing the event just because that event happens to be speech-related.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328301/#Comment_328301" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T16:11:57+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  4:11PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a playtest of a game about refugees I played, there was a rule that when you were speaking to someone in your own culture, you got to talk as your character, but when you were talking to someone outside your culture, you'd just describe what the character was trying to communicate. The difference between:<br/><br/>"Oh hey man, how's it going? Hey I hear there's a game on the TV tonight, want to come over and watch it?"<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>"He makes some informal greeting, and then invites you to his house later today to watch something on TV"<br/><br/>The effect was to really emphasise the distance between in-group and out-group people.

All players spoke a little bit of pretty bad german (we're danish), so whenever two characters with a pretty low lowest common denominator of language skill talked, we spoke german, and any words not in german were to be taken as gibberish, like when we accidentally filled in with danish or english words.
