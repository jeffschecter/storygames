Early in the book Spinelli gives an outline of Emund Husserl's phenomenological method. I've written out the method below as it might apply to roleplaying (but because I'm lazy I've copied most of it directly from Spinelli's book).<br/>\n<br/>\n<i><b>The Rule of Epoche</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThis rule urges us to set aside our initial biases and prejudice of things, to suspend our expectations and assumptions so that we can focus on the primary and immediate data of our characters' experience. In other words, the rule of epoche urges us to impose an 'openess' on our characters' immediate experience so that subsequent interpretations may prove more adequate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Rule of Description</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe essence of this rule is: 'describe don't explain'. Having 'opened up to the possibilities' contained in our characters' immediate experience through the rule of epoche, we are now urged not to place limitations upon our characters' experience by immediately trying to explain or make sense of it in terms of whatever theories or hypothesis we tend towards. Instead, the rule of description urges us to remain initially focused on our characters' immediate impressions and maintain a descriptive relationship with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Rule of Horizontalization</b><br/>\n<br/>\nHaving stuck to an immediate experience which we seek to describe, this rule further urges us to avoid placing any heirarchy of significance or importance upon the items of our descriptions, and instead to treat each initially as having equal value or significance.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nDo you ever strive for anything like the phenomenological method while roleplaying or do you go the complete other direction?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207709/#Comment_207709" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-16T06:06:34+00:00" title="May 16, 2009  6:06AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As much as I love phenomenology, oddly enough, no one ever lives like that. Phenomenology can yield such startling insights (my favorites: David Abram, Tim Ingold) precisely because all of us begin interpreting what happens to us in the context of our assumptions and ideas <em>immediately</em>. So they become self-reinforcing; we see increasing evidence for them, because we interpret everything we experience in light of them, which offers further evidence for them, until we accept them as unquestionable truth.<br><br>I tend to look at playing a role, largely, as adopting a different set of assumptions for a while. Which could prove a valuable phenomenological exercise, actually, because it would let you experience, first-hand, how pervasive those assumptions get, and how your assumptions may not hold the pristine, universal truth we usually assume they do. But so far as Husserl's goal of direct experience, I think unless you want to play a phenomenological philosopher, I don't know if anyone really experiences the world like that.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207717/#Comment_207717" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-16T09:08:49+00:00" title="May 16, 2009  9:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MJGraham</cite><br>Do you ever strive for anything like the phenomenological method while roleplaying or do you go the complete other direction?</br></blockquote>\nNo. I'm a player-centered role-player. I try to push games aggressively towards what <b>I</b> think is interesting about the situation rather than trying to get deeply into a character. <br><br>That said, perhaps a game system can reinforce an experiential, observational, non-hierarchical mode of play. Most game assign resources, dice, time etc to certain elements, be they characters, motives, opposition, etc. This creates a striated SIS/described worrld where certain things are more explained than others and certain things are more important than others. If you want a smoother, more horizontal world/SIS, deny participants the ability to 'flag' things early on. <br><br>For example, say there's a game about alien intelligences possessing humans. The first half hour or hour of play could be about just establishing what's around. Every thing described, encountered etc could get a card or die - a smooth mass of stuff, nothing more important than the rest. Then maybe later, though greater understanding/ interpretation, the cards/dice could start clustering on what is significant to the players. <br><br>ps- In a thread way back when I described my school of role playing as quotidian, phenomenological, dialectical-optical, simulationism so I appreciate this thread                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207748/#Comment_207748" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-16T17:32:15+00:00" title="May 16, 2009  5:32PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's funny to me is that the last two elements seem like what turned so many people away from traditional gaming towards a more structured and premise-oriented narrative (ie. many indie games.) Many gamers take horizontalization to heart to the point that nothing important ever seems to happen -- these are the parties that spend the exact same amount of time shopping in town as they do fighting the dragon as they do travelling through the woods as they do setting up every tedious overnight watch. Similarly, embracing the rule of description makes it impossible for players to anticipate and act towards the creation of meaning in their stories.<br><br>Of course when you are missing step <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> no amount of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> are going to make your play phenomenological, otherwise I would say semi-dysfunctional oldschool D&amp;D groups have it down pat. Everything is described in excruciating detail, there is no pacing, and nothing is more important than anything else.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
