Durham 3 listeners will know that the lads from N. Carolina like to talk a little during their podcasts, take an off-mike break to actually play a game and then come back on-mike to talk some more.  Which is an interesting format because of it's immediacy.<br/><br/>But they've finally finished their Contenders game and used episode <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2336&amp;Mode=like">#36</a> to do a debrief on the game.  It's probably the best gaming podcast episode I've listened to, bar none.  It felt like being a fly on the wall in someone's living room after they finished up a game and started to talk about what they liked and didn't like about it.  It was very honest and they had some great feedback about the game; including why it was awesome for them and how it could be even better.  Which is doubly valuable since this is a GM-less game that needs a lot of player energy to thrive.<br/><br/>I've played the game several times and while I was very jazzed about it, the role-playing fell a bit flat both times.  But after listening to this, I see some concrete ways that I could be playing the game differently to make it rock out.  So much love to Clinton/Jason/Remi/Shane.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy" title="Yokiboy"><img alt="Yokiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yokiboy">Yokiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69414/#Comment_69414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T18:09:37+00:00" title="May 15, 2007  6:09PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah Chris, I think the last episode of Durham 3 was the best ever! The way they broke down GM-less play was just great. I've saved the episode and will go back and listen to it again, and again for pointers. I'm using GM-less games to get my group used to some of the tasks of GMs, while at the same allowing me the same role as the rest of the players, and the advice was very valuable.<br/><br/>TTFN,<br/><br/>Yoki                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
