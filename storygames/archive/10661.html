Two of us would form a line, with arms around each other's shoulders. We would then walk around the playground, chanting "Who wants to play It? No girls! Who wants to play It? No girls!".<br/><br/>Obviously, this was in the days when associating with the opposite sex was a bad thing, and likely to lead to accusations that you were, yourself, a girl. Even so, I'm not sure we meant the "no girls" thing. It was just part of the rhyme. I remember that, on one occasion, we changed it to "No girls or Richard", to discourage Richard from playing with us. The girls themselves, of course, did not use this method, forming their groups using conversation or social skills or one of those other abilities we didn't have.<br/><br/>If you wanted to play the game, you joined on the end of the line, placing your arms around the shoulders of someone on the end of the line. Eventually, you would get a line of eleven or twelve boys, all chanting the same thing, at which point we would start playing the game.<br/><br/>Looking back, it was a remarkably efficient way of getting people to play a game. You hung around talking to people until you heard someone chanting something you wanted to play. You joined the line, and chanted, which kept you busy while you were waiting to play. Then, when you were ready to play, you were all together and ready to start.<br/><br/>I wonder if there is a way of adapting this to the con environment? I'm not actually suggesting that we form long lines, chanting "Who wants to play In A Wicked Age? No girls or Simon" with arms around shoulders. We would certainly not exclude female gamers: although the idea of adding riders like "No-one under 18" is appealing. In any case, the idea of calling out game names, then slowly forming groups until you reach critical mass, might work well.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236430/#Comment_236430" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-08T15:32:37+00:00" title="October  8, 2009  3:32PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go Play NW did something like this.

However, one problem with social methods is that they can just end up with people playing with people they know. I want to play Dogs, but the game signed up in seconds, mostly with friends of the GM.<br/><br/>One thing I like about this method is that it's inclusive. You can join the line, whether or not you know the people in it. Well, OK, realistically, you ask "Can I play?" and they probably say "Yes".<br/><br/>It does rely on people having other things to do while games are being formed, I think.<br/><br/>What other social ways are there to form games at cons?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236517/#Comment_236517" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T05:00:38+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  5:00AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>However, one problem with social methods is that they can just end up with people playing with people they know.</blockquote>\nSo true.  <br/><br/>Make a point of <i>not </i>playing with your home town crew at conventions.  Make a point of playing with more distant friends.  Make a point of playing with strangers.  <br/><br/>I think the best way to organize an informal game at a con is to bring one and run it.  Stand there, announce you are putting together a game, and grab the first four people who express interest, no matter who they are (they won't be your home town crew, because those people know better).  Happily, there are many games that are well suited for convention play that require no prep and no GM, so being the organizer doesn't have to be a huge ordeal.  I do this all the time and have made many friends this way.  <br/><br/>My unhappiest pick-up game experiences typically involve trying to engineer this process - committing to play a certain game at a certain time with a certain person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236519/#Comment_236519" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T05:31:58+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  5:31AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2009 5:32AM by Darcy Burgess.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>My unhappiest pick-up game experiences typically involve trying to engineer this process - committing to play a certain game at a certain time with a certain person.</blockquote>\nWill you <i>never</i> let me live that down?

Jason shouts "Who wants to play And My Axe"? Now, I wouldn't <i>mind</i> playing And My Axe, but there's other games I'd <i>really</i> like to play. So what do I do? Play now? Or wait and risk playing nothing? <br/><br/>That becomes easier if we're doing stuff while we're waiting. So, if I'm in the Embassy Suites having a drink, I think, well, no, I won't play And My Axe, I'll stick around with these guys for a while.<br/><br/>There's other interesting social things you can do, too. You can have a rolling game that people join in and leave when they've got something more permanent: Inspectres is pretty good for this.<br/><br/>You can negotiate games openly, with people saying "I'd like to run And My Axe", and someone else saying "OK, you guys go over there and run And My Axe, and we'll do a game of Tripod over here". I think it's the best method, but it only works with small numbers of people. I'd love to find a way to extend that to bigger numbers.<br/><br/>And there's sign-up sheets, of course.

All ofus in a room while each GM pitches his game to the audience. Sign ups would get you priority on a game, but the fill in was raised hands and negotiation.<br/><br/>Sucky part: some poor dudes had to get up and pitch with a couple of sign-ups that didn't show... and then no one wanted in because they were waiting for some other game. It's like being picked for middle school basketball all over again, except the whole CLASS rejects you, not just the two team captains. I felt really sorry for a few of them; and I vow never to do such a "slave auction/cattle call" setup for any con gaming I (help) organize.<br/><br/>Prior sign-up is about the only good way, with an understanding that if a game doesn't make by (say) an hour before its slot, the GM is not required to sit and hope, but can go find a game to get into. I know as a demoer, it REALLY sucks to watch a whole con slot slip away and not play anything. As such, I avoid demoing "open play" anymore, like Icehouse or pick-up FLUXX or whatever, because I don't want to gamble on only being patronized for a few minutes by the handful of OTHER poor saps that got dropped by an un-made game.<br/><br/>(Plus, frankly... fucking parents treat an Icehouse demo table like a nursery; and I am about sick of that, even as I DO like to demo for the little snots. If I ever do IH game demoing again, it will be "Parent Required for Minors" and I'll just explain it as a liability issue--"Sorry, sir/madam; I am not bonded nor am I a licensed child care worker." Or maybe--"Yeesssss, PLEASE leave these DEAR, SWEET ones here with me. Oh, rest assured, we'll all have a LOT of fun, over here in the corner table. Go! Go wander the Dealer Room! I PROMISE I'll be RIGHT here when you get back!" *insane, toothy grin*<br/><br/>OK, sorry for the ranty aside.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236597/#Comment_236597" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T09:55:31+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  9:55AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my boardgame club, we had a game we called the metagame, for when lots of people want to play a game, but no one can really agree on what game they want to play.<br/><br/>Everyone picks one game and puts it on the table.  Give everyone a number of playing cards equal to the number of games (so if you have 13 games, Ace-King.  Everyone should have different cards, so you'll need multiple decks with different backs.)<br/><br/>Everyone puts one card on each game.  Higher card, greater preference.<br/><br/>Count the highest four (or five, or whatever) cards on each game.  Whatever game has the highest total gets played.  (Tie breaker is highest-low card.  Next tie-breaker is highest low card from other cards not counted.)  The people with those cards?  They play that game, and remove their cards from all the games.<br/><br/>Now you've got like 9 people left in the mix.  Do that again- count the highest four cards on each game.  Those four people play that highest scoring game.<br/><br/>Now you've got 5 people.  Sum up the last games.  Play the one with the highest score.<br/><br/>If you end up playing a game you put your Ace on, you get an extra card next time you play the metagame- if there's 8 games, you get a Ace-9, and may leave one card unplayed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236600/#Comment_236600" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T10:06:08+00:00" title="October  9, 2009 10:06AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Willow, I'm guessing this is for situations where you've only one copy of a game, ya?<br/><br/>Hehe.. and next time you have 13 folks wanting to play something, suggest Mafia! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236654/#Comment_236654" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T12:50:30+00:00" title="October  9, 2009 12:50PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I've wanted to run a convention in the same way you'd run a BarCamp: everyone who wants to run a game during the day stands up and proposes it; the organizer gathers up all the proposals and kind of schedules them, and then people make marks on what they want to do.
