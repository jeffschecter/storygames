It's taught being taught by Sky, someone I know who studied theatre at a nearby University. She has also been involved in doing <a href="http://www.theatreoftheoppressed.org/" rel="nofollow">Theatre of the Oppressed</a>, but this class is just an introductory and exploratory class. We probably won't take to the streets right away.<br/><br/>The first class was last Sunday. We did some warm-ups and a few exercises to get us into the mood. The class was small, six people including the instructor. We had people with a range of experience: me with no acting/improv experience but with the (somewhat) related rpg background, someone who teaches drama, a couple people who have acted, one who took this class before and one semi-professional actor. It made a difference to have a ringer. <br/><br/>Many of the exercises we did worked with the difference between working a scene in mime vs with words, or contrasting words with action. We did What are you doing?, Freeze-tag, and one where we someone started off doing an activity, then the rest of us added in doing what we thought of as a related activity until we were all in the scene.  <br/><br/>I don't know what that last is called, but it was the first one we did. It went <b>way</b> better than Sky would have imagined. She'd asked us to do this exercise probably to illustrate how difficult it is to communicate via gesture what you are thinking, and to give us an opportunity to work on it. But we showed her. <br/><br/>Ethan, the actor, was the first one to jump in after she described what we should do. He'd done it before and (as ever) he came up with an idea quickly.  He started out by walking up to part of the stage,  and clearly knocking on a door. He leaned down and looked through a mail slot, with an angry expression on his face. Then he walked around the "house" and did the same at another "door".  <br/><br/>Okay, I saw the frame, and how I could add in. So I jumped into the house and mimed reading a book. When the knocking happened, I hunkered down deeper into the book. At this point I was thinking that he was a bill collector that I was trying to avoid. BUT THEN, Ethan went to the back of the house and started opening a window, and crept inside. <br/><br/>That's when the scene took off. <br/><br/>The next person jumped in and lay down, pretending to be another person, asleep in the house, while I "heard" the break in and crept into the room with the window (I just realized I've been thinking of that room as the kitchen all this time <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.  Ethan moved down the hallway, back to the original door, so I got to miss him in the kitchen. I went back to where I'd been and picked up a bat or poker from the fireplace.  A chase ensued between Ethan and I and the sleeper awoke to want to know what was going on. <br/><br/>The action was completely clear: the woken person and I nabbed the robber, I called the police and Sky came in and pulled a gun.  I mis-read her at first, thinking she might be an accomplice, and jumped back from the gun, but of course all was well. The other two people came in as a photographer and a disapproving neighbor, but  it took a long time for the last person to find her place in the scene, so there was a long time when the robber got away and became involved in a car chase with the police officer, which ended tragically in a crash, killling the robber.  <br/><br/>Now, when Sky started the scene, the example she gave was of someone pretending to be in a rocket ship, that might be thought to be washing clothes by someone else, or making dinner by someone else. Like a game of visual operator. But as soon as the frame of the house was introduced, and the plot of the housebreak happened--it was clear to all what was and could happen. We dropped into roles--mostly--as easily as pie, and carried out a fairly short, but cohesive narrative at the drop of a hat.  <br/><br/>This was kind of the wrong way for me to start improv. I've been planning on dropping all of my narrativist tendencies, to truly soak up the in-the-moment nature of improv. Coming into it with no expectations and so on. Adding structure later on after I've gotten a chance to learn how they do their form, since it is so different (Paul and Remi, I finally listened to the HGWT shows 97&amp;98 yesterday, very illumninating, I'll write about those soon too).  But here we go and screw up all my expectations and have a fun little story emerge from nowhere right at the drop of the hat. <br/><br/>Maybe I should not be so quick to drop my long term goals after all. <br/><br/>So, improv folk, am I wrong to think I should leave my narrative goals at the door? Or was this some strange aberration I should ignore?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101022/#Comment_101022" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T08:25:23+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  8:25AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You didn't make any moral statements with your improv, so no, you didn't fulfill any narrativist goals.

Let's see, Paul.  <br/><br/>What I expected, as did the faciliator, was for this exercise to be much like what Jason described: one activity that we all took part in. Or perhaps several loosely overlapping interpretations of an activity. For example, before the scene started, I'd thought about miming making an ice cream cone. Maybe someone else would have bought the cone from me. Then someone else started selling balloons, whatever.  <br/><br/>The difference here was that the scene we played was a situation in motion. A plot developed naturally out of it, and the characters that people continued to introduce kept allowing the action to develop in new ways.  I really enjoyed it. The structure of the robbery allowed most of us to hook in quickly and easily and made for a satisfying story experience for me. <br/><br/>It was different from the other exercises we did. In those,  we were learning how to express ourselves in short bursts, learning about spontaneity, helping ourselves let go of preconceived ideas of what would happen. I definitely got the picture from some other exercises, that I those things hold challenges for me.  But that is why I'm taking the class. To stretch myself and work on those weaknesses. <br/><br/>But...it was very easy and fun to do this first scene. It makes me wonder why I should want to give up having a story structure within which to improvise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101122/#Comment_101122" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T13:39:46+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  1:39PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm having difficult seeing how doing a scene where the "plot developed naturally" is different from "learning about spontentiety, helping ourselves let go of preconceived notions of what would happen."

At this point I was thinking that he was a bill collector that I was trying to avoid.</blockquote>\nYou had plot the moment you hid. He's a bill collector, I'm hiding is cool little plot. Its inherently different from:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>OK it's a laboratory, I step in and start mopping the floors.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101315/#Comment_101315" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T12:43:58+00:00" title="October  5, 2007 12:43PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2007 12:44PM by Emily_Care.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I'm in the right class. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'm interested in learning about techniques of improv, and I am doing so. It was just interesting to see a more plot oriented scene develop so quickly and easily when that wasn't the intent. <br/><br/>Honestly, I think what this means is that I'll be pleasantly surprised once I want to start applying what I learn there in service to story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101333/#Comment_101333" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T14:13:25+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  2:13PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is no style of gaming at all that can't benefit from knowing more about improv, and that's true no matter how much improv you know.
