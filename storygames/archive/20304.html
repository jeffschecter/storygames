In my mind and in playing it, it certainly doesn't have to.  A loser in Act One can finish the game/story a loser.  <br/>That's why Fiasco works well as a game, the theme works because the source material is somewhat atypical.

It describes any situation in which the audience knows something important that a character doesn't know.  It's a classical definition, already existing, that I applied to RPGs because it works the same way.  So in Fiasco, for instance, if we the Players know this is going to end badly, while the characters think it might end up well for them, that fits the classical definition of Dramatic Irony.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447618/#Comment_447618" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-04T21:35:15+00:00" title="August  4, 2015  9:35PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I'm talking about games and how they help or hinder players tell a story.  I'm not hugely concerned with what's going on in the players heads.  Who can figure that out anyway?  Someone I suppose, but not this someone.  For the sake of this, let's talk about game and story, and their structures, okay?   <br/><br/>I'm not certain that all stories told via Fiasco end badly for all the characters.  <br/>Some characters make out like bandits.  Some start out as bandits and end as bandits.  There's no mechanical incentive for contrast.  There are incentives, just not hard-coded ones.  There's the preconceived notion of story and how drama/comedy works, but that's not really a mechanical thing.  <br/>I mean, players CAN exert power over another player's dice, if that player lets them.  If a player always chooses to Resolve, he or she's gonna pretty much control their own fate, well at least concerning the Aftermath.  The dice part of their story.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is I don't play Fiasco knowing that shit's gonna end badly for me(my character).  I mean, I'm okay when it does(usually), but I don't go into it with that notion.  I've got other notions to contend with.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447619/#Comment_447619" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-04T21:59:15+00:00" title="August  4, 2015  9:59PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, point taken.

Is the thing you're talking about really different from these things in a meaningful way?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447629/#Comment_447629" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-05T16:58:27+00:00" title="August  5, 2015  4:58PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like when a story goes in a circle, it's a nice trick to keep thing coherent and help the spectator notice that there was a theme underneath. Enforcing this mechanically is... well, doable and enjoyable but I like it when the decision to make the story of my character go in full circle is left up to me. <br/><br/>I mean, I might enjoy helping another PC's story go full circle, or I may want to be my story about something else. Even when playing VtM I couldn't care less about the "I strive to keep my humanity even when I've gotta suck blood" because I was playing a Malkavian and having a heck of fun being "the Trickster" in the story of the rest of the players.<br/><br/>I see that nobody is making me go where I don't want to... except that (and sorry for going again with the word autopsy deal) "necessary" is still bugging me out. But please, take this as a cultural thing. In my culture (I'm peruvian), the whole "necessary hypocrisy" expression translates into something full of bad roleplaying meanings. I know this probably doesn't make any sense to you, I had to confront the same thing when I found out that, say, "oriental" is a bad word and you're better not using it to mean "people from X place", nor "culture from same X place" as way too many people find it disrespectful. While in my culture is actually the opposite. That's what I mean with a "cultural thing", I hope this explaining suffices.<br/><br/>Anyway, my point is just that:<br/>- circles are cool<br/>- mechanics that help you get there are cool<br/>- I don't see a need to enforce (anymore that it's been already established) rules/mechanics that make you go into a specific circle, even if it's the central theme proposed by the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447843/#Comment_447843" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-10T09:57:56+00:00" title="August 10, 2015  9:57AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What I'm saying is I don't play Fiasco knowing that shit's gonna end badly for me(my character).

What strikes me is the contradiction between the element of competition in them.\n<blockquote>"Caillois\u2019 first pattern covers competitive games (what he calls agon /.../  Caillois\u2019 second pattern (named alea after the Latin for dice) concerns games of chance and fate, /.../ everyone has the same chance of winning not because of attempts to balance talent but because skill has no bearing on victory."</blockquote>\nIf we assume that this is right (I don't fully agree), both are about competition - winning. Then we got the other two.\n<blockquote>"In Caillois\u2019 third pattern (ilinx), the game paradigm is completely different as there is no role for victory at all, /.../ This is the play of vertigo, which is exemplified in the fairground ride that uses dizzying speeds and centripetal accelerations to tap into excitement and fear. /.../ So too his fourth and final pattern, mimicry, /.../ theatrical play that Caillois /.../ recognizes as a game paradigm radically distinct from the play of winning."</blockquote>\nThese two doesn't have any victory conditions. It's instead about sensing something, either what happens around you or inside of you (in character).<br/><br/>Aren't these two differences what the distinction between rule-play and role-play is really about? That the first is talking about the competitive element while the latter totally lacks it? That's why I personally would like to see roleplaying games purely addressing one of either side, and therefor finding tools (structures) to specifically bring forth that particular playstyle. By focusing on one side, we can challenge ourselves as game designers to find new ways of designing!<br/><br/>I think it's important to realize that roleplaying games are a hodge-podge, born from people making interpretation of how someone can play roleplaying games and what they think is fun. That Gary Gygax's original rule-play has have an addition from others, namely mimicy - role-play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447845/#Comment_447845" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-10T11:20:37+00:00" title="August 10, 2015 11:20AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dramatic poles from DramaSystem make this explicit                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447849/#Comment_447849" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-10T13:22:50+00:00" title="August 10, 2015  1:22PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the classic D&amp;D module B2 - The Keep on the Borderlands readers and actual players alike often realized that there are more loot in the Keep than in the lairs of various monsters so the campaigns sometimes got an evil twist...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448174/#Comment_448174" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-22T21:28:46+00:00" title="August 22, 2015  9:28PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Mountain Witch, which some of you might remember?\n<blockquote>Dramatic poles from DramaSystem make this explicit</blockquote>Dramasystem kinda handwaves this.

It's like getting Fan Mail, but you have to wait until you're done playing to get it.  <br/>RPG's are a work-in-progress, just like any art or craft.<br/><br/>The mechanics don't really touch on theme, like plot theme.  There's no bonus points for thematic contrast, outside of a characters particular personal struggles.  I think character driven rpgs can get lazy by ignoring theme, plot and message.
