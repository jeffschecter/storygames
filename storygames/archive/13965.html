My Kelly was almost spotless.<br/><br/>Getting tempted by Deceptions is the fun part of the game, so if you roll great, things just move along tickety-boo. The only thing you can do to tempt trouble is keep rolling on a streak, but once you hit 40 on a health marker you're done. It would be weirdly self-destructive to keep rolling just to look for drama.<br/><br/>So I was thinking of an optional rule to spice up cakewalks:\n<blockquote>The Savior player can always choose to adopt questionable methods at the start of a Progress scene -- maybe you're doing something quasi-legal, maybe you're just glossing over the truth. You get a Progress scene, but you don't cross off a number (so it's an extra scene in addition to the normal nine).<br/><br/><i>Before</i> the free scene starts, you automatically move one token from Admiration to Deception. Your first roll of the scene counts as Lies, not Health. You can keep rolling in the same scene, and later rolls are normal. You can build honest success on top of your skullduggery.<br/><br/>The automatic Deception is in addition to the normal results of the Progress scene. You could go dirty, move one to Deception, then roll a 1 and lie and move another token to Deception.</blockquote>\nHaven't tried it yet, but I think it would work.

It seems like it could only lead to bad things.  That said, give it a try!  Maybe the desire to make things interesting (in a corrupt sort of way) will be enough to drive a player towards taking an extra scene.<br/><br/>For some reason, both Hero's Banner and Mars Colony drive players to seek out failure.  Obviously, there is a lot of interesting mechanics hiding behind a failure.  If you succeed too often, then those interesting mechanics remain hidden.  However, my intention with Mars Colony was to keep the game interesting even if you are succeeding.  At the same time, during the Ashcan process, I actually made it more difficult to succeed (e.g., by removing the double doubles rules).  But I'm still relying on odds to play out as they will.  With a streak, there is no getting around the fact that Kelly's journey will be less varied.  My other secret hope is that players play the game multiple times (like you, Ben), and that any lucky or unlucky streaks even out.<br/><br/>So two follow-up questions:<br/><br/>1.  You said 'almost spotless'.  Did those one or two failures you did encounter affect gameplay in any significant way?  Or were you just looking for a scandal 'cause they're fun?<br/><br/>2.  Is success too boring for you?  On the failure side of the game, there is deception and scandal.  Would you want something similarly interesting on the success side?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
