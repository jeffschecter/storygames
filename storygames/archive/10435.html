October 9-11, Tucson Convention Center, BE THERE.<br/><br/>Friday, 2 PM: A Penny For My Thoughts<br/><br/>You remember nothing of what happened in the cellar of the house high on the hill, or was it deep in the cemetery? The experimental memory treatment you will undergo at the Orphic Institute will help you and your fellow patients remember what happened. But do you really want to? Experience the newest story-based RPG. No prior experience necessary.\t<br/><br/>Friday 6pm:\tThe Job  (Alpha Omega)<br/><br/>You've got the plan. You've got the skills. You even think you can trust each other - just long enough to pull off the job. They'll be talking about this heist for years to come. But if it were easy, they wouldn't have needed you...Come and experience the exciting new cyberpunk/postapocalyptic/science fiction/fantasy roleplaying game Alpha Omega from MindStorm Labs. Pregenerated characters provided, no experience necessary.<br/><br/>Friday 10pm:\tProm Night Ninjas 2: Homecoming (Feng Shui)<br/><br/>Last year at Beverly Hills High School's prom night, an ancient ninja clan tried to take its revenge on the students of the beloved ninjitsu instructor Mr. Wing. Now it's Homecoming and time for the furious fists of the Prom Night Ninjas to defend their school again! This crazy Feng Shui scenario is a great intro to this fast-paced high-octane action game - and a perfect late-night game to blow off steam after a long day of fun. No prior experience needed, pregenerated characters provided.<br/><br/>Saturday 10am:\tTucson By Night: Floor 13 (World of Darkness)<br/><br/>A cabal of vampires wants to protect it. A conspiracy of werewolves wants to destroy it. A gang of hunters wants to recover it. Who will come away with the prize...and their lives? Tucson's World of Darkness tabletop shared universe project invites everyone to join in the fun as three tables interact with the same plotline.\t<br/><br/>Saturday 2pm: Arthur Lives! - 1963 (True20)<br/><br/>1963. The top singles in America are "She Loves You", "Louie Louie" and "Be My Baby". Martin Luther King writes in a Birmingham jail and speaks from the steps of the Capitol. Kennedy is in the White House. And in Manhattan, certain people begin to remember a time long ago when ladies in lakes gave magical swords and kings and wizards quested for the Grail. They begin to remember who they are - knights and damosels, witches and spirits, spies and villains, but is myth doomed to repeat itself as much as history? If you thought "Mad Men" was a good TV show but needed more magic potions and turning into hawks, come and play in this unique True20 game. Pregenerated characters provided.\t<br/><br/>Saturday 10pm:\tGBI: Miami (Ghostbusters d6)<br/><br/>The Ghostbusters International franchise was so successful (?!) in New York City that Louis Tully, head accountant, has decided that a new franchise is needed. And where are all second franchises opened? Miami! The top candidates were contacted and all said "hell no", leaving your player characters to fill in. Strap on the proton packs, get the traps ready, put on some sunglasses and yell "YEEEAHHHHHHH!!" with The Who as you come to your first week of work at GBI: Miami. Characters take 10 seconds to make. No previous experience necessary.<br/><br/>Sunday 10am:\tGamemaster's Seminar<br/><br/>The Southern Arizona Gamemaster's Conference in August was a success, now hear even more from the presenters and learn about upcoming events. Berin Kinsman, Ron Blessing and Jason Corley will give presentations for GMs new and old. Berin will speak on "Saying No", Ron will address "Playing Through Distractions", and the keynote will be Jason Corley on "Story Structure as a GM Tool".\t<br/><br/>Sunday Noon:\tShared Universe Meet and Greet <br/><br/>Come and meet Tucson GMs and players who are getting involved in the exciting shared tabletop universes being organized through SAGA. If you are interested in organizing or joining a campaign in our World of Darkness shared world, or getting in on the ground floor of a fantasy RPG shared world that's just beginning, come to this informal meet-and-greet and take the first step!\t<br/><br/>Sunday 2pm:\tSweeps Week: Curtains (Primetime Adventures)<br/><br/>You might think that a theater company might only have to deal with tantrumming divas, dawdling writers, demanding backers, duelling acrobats, self-centered maestros, opium-addicted thespians, malfunctioning sets and looming deadlines. ("C'est tout? Is that all?") But when mysterious and dark monsters live in the sewers of Paris, the prop man is a steampunk mad scientist and the theater ghost won't even buy a proper ticket, now you've come to the latest hit series, "Curtains". Balancing comedy, horror and drama, this Sweeps Week entry will compete with other shows for audience.<br/><br/><br/>I'll probably post more about Sweeps Week as we work on it some more. Basically we are running 3 tables of Primetime Adventures at the same time and trying to flesh out the audience participation mechanic more so people can "switch channels" between tables more robustly.<br/><br/>Come down and run some games of your own, it will be great.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232345/#Comment_232345" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T18:07:38+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  6:07PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm particularly looking forward to the GM seminar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_232341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232341/#Comment_232341" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-14T18:08:10+00:00" title="September 14, 2009  6:08PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>The Southern Arizona Gamemaster's Conference in August was a success</blockquote>\nHrm?

Although the Facts &amp; Reassurances implies "Cthulhu" and all gamers love Cthulhu, the amount of Cthulhu was relatively minimal. What we had was a game that was more like a gothic British suspense novel or horror film from the 70s in which the vicar and Satan are responsible for everything. Interestingly, the sleepy English village also suffered a "rage outbreak" like 28 Days Later, and the asylum nearby seemed not actually to be helping matters much. One participant may have inadvertently invented a predecessor to Mnenosyne when she over-drugged the rage-infected and said "they began to speak in unison..."<br/>\n<blockquote>Friday 6pm:\tThe Job  (Alpha Omega)</blockquote>\nPretty damn good. I used an "intro the setting as you play" approach to getting everyone up to speed first by focusing on the cool stuff on their character sheets, then how the team was gathered. Since this was basically a Leverage episode with cyberpunk, everything moved along at a fair clip. By the way, the AO support for demos is great. They basically gave me a T-shirt, all participants got a $10 coupon and one got a $25 coupon. WUT. Anyway, fun.\n<blockquote>Friday 10pm:\tProm Night Ninjas 2: Homecoming (Feng Shui)</blockquote>\nI don't even know where to start. When I was listing characters ("Joey the jock ninja, Jenni the ditzy ninja") and said "Connor, the hipster ninja", and the guy sitting next to me said "Me, that one's me. Calling it." and then played it dead on to the absolute hilt, including haircuts, vespa, garage band and insulting someone because "I've seen lots of girls wear those shoes."  Or the nerd ninja fighting the evil nerd ninja and exchanging Star Trek and D&amp;D related quips. The very quiet girl playing the ditzy ninja who insisted that her disguise was "a hat I would <b>never</b> wear".  Late-night games are hard to recreate in your mind. But it was a hoot and a holler.\n<blockquote>Saturday 10am:\tTucson By Night: Floor 13 (World of Darkness)</blockquote>\nA mixed bag. We didn't achieve all our goals on this one. For one thing, the chokepoints were too chokepointy, which drew the games into far too much real-time action. We didn't want that, we wanted it to be more scene based and objective based. The secondary objectives got lost in the shadow of the first, so one group walked away feeling pretty crummy (though they started with by far the best of the table experiences.) Alas. A learning experience.\n<blockquote>Saturday 2pm: Arthur Lives! - 1963 (True20)</blockquote>\nDidn't happen. One signup, and she had laryngitis. She was nice enough to send word that she couldn't attend though. I took the time to rest my voice and play a Star Wars game. Who am I kidding, I spent the Star Wars game sneering and taunting at the Sith.\n<blockquote>Saturday 10pm:\tGBI: Miami (Ghostbusters d6)</blockquote>\nI had at least 5 people stop the game to actually pick up my Ghostbusters manual. "Is this <i>real</i>?!" many asked. Ah. <br/><br/>It was phenomenal. I was nervous because I agreed to take on 2 extra walkups for a total of 7. I incorporated a lot of "describe the person to your right" kind of things and gave them plenty of opportunity to wisecrack and blame things on each other.<br/><br/>Again, I don't really remember that much of it except laughing silly.<br/><br/>Here's a great callback:<br/><br/>At the beginning, I had everyone name and give the prior occupation of the person to their right.<br/><br/>One guy was named "Arthur" and the person very calmly said "Arthur is a former Chippendale dancer".<br/><br/>2 hours later Arthur is being questioned by a police officer.  "How did you get mixed up with these bozos?" he asks. <br/><br/>Arthur says: "This is my retirement. In my old job we pretty much retired at 21."<br/><br/>The game paused for 5 seconds....and then FELL APART with raucous laughing.\n<blockquote>Sunday 10am:\tGamemaster's Seminar</blockquote>\nWent well, though on a much smaller scale than the earlier one. Amazingly, we had a big turnout. This is not what I expect from a convention seminar. I was expecting 5-8 or so. We had around 15-20, and everyone was eager to discuss, which was excellent.\n<blockquote>Sunday Noon:\tShared Universe Meet and Greet</blockquote>\nWe got one GM prospect and she knows some others. Kelley Barnes from White Wolf showed up and was very gracious in giving us her organizational ideas and experience to basically a small table of about 5 people thinking about where to go next.\n<blockquote>Sunday 2pm:\tSweeps Week: Curtains (Primetime Adventures)</blockquote>\nMy game was "Curtains", which I think was actually first posted here a long time ago in a PTA thread. We had a great mixture of people new to PTA and experienced people who could help them. The spotlight character was someone who had never played it before. She ran the game back 90 yards for a goddamn touchdown. She was playing M. Durand, the producer, and his travails were hilarious, scary, and when he triumphed, the whole table erupted clapping. The audience members standing nearby said "I'm definitely tuning in next week."<br/><br/>By the by, PTA fans should be watching the "Here's what you missed" intros to Glee even if you're not watching the rest of the show.<br/><br/>I'm finally home and exhausted. Got to party with Wil Wheaton and play some other stuff not on this list.  But I also walked out with a ton of swag for running these games and having fun. What a great hobby this is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237035/#Comment_237035" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-12T13:20:20+00:00" title="October 12, 2009  1:20PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2009 1:20PM by JDCorley.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other things I got to play included:<br/><br/>A Hunter: the Vigil game set during the siege of Boston in the Revolutionary War. We were Sons of Liberty agents digging into why our Committee of Correspondence had been targetted by an evil witch. I was a smuggler, who I immediately made French. It was a very France-themed convention for me.<br/><br/>A prototype of a game that may or may not come out soon, with a liar's dice mechanic. Since I love liar's dice in every possible form, I won by one thousand million points, approximately.<br/><br/>Among the many cool things I snagged:<br/><br/>Some great 4th Edition GURPS stuff that I normally wouldn't have put at the top of my "to get" list, free by running games.<br/>Some White Wolf stuff that I missed when it passed through my FLGS in numbers too small for me to grab, one of which, "Intruders From The Abyss", is so fucking incredibly great.<br/>A copy of Sea Dracula on green paper!<br/>Some free Munchkin cards, LOL Munchkin<br/>Some Call of Cthulhu books I'd never seen before, including the Morocco supplement. <i>Morocco.</i> In the 20s.

I always try to get through two episodes of PTA in a 4-hour con block, though sometimes there is just too much budget cycling back in for that to work. And because of our "competitive" PTA idea, we all had show concepts going in. So here's what I did:<br/><br/>I made characters with a name, an Issue and one Edge: their role in the theater troupe. M. Durand -  the Producer - Control Issues, Therese - the Diva - Narcissism, Pietro - the Upcoming Actor - Recognition, Doctor Rousseau - Mad Stage Engineer - Family, and so on. 5 people picked from 9 choices or so.<br/><br/>Then I wrote a bunch of Edges and Connections appropriate to the show on 3x5 cards and scattered them in the middle of the table. Everyone picked two, kept one and put one back.  (It also was put in front of them so everyone could see it.)<br/><br/>That brought them to either 2 Edges or 1 Edge and 1 Connection. The last Connection or Edge they created themselves with some help from everyone.<br/><br/>Essentially I was trying to ramp up their contribution to the show from "here are your options" to "here are some ideas" to "what are your ideas?"<br/><br/>As far as the competitive stuff, here's what we did.  We gave a chip of fanmail - unique for each show (I had blue poker chips, the zombie survival drama had black, Hell's Kitchen: The Animated Series had green stones) - to every audience member that came by.  If an audience member put a chip of another show's fanmail in, it went into the middle of the table immediately (as if it was spent Budget), and we marked it down on a sheet of paper - the audience member had "switched channels" from one table to another, and gotten so involved that they wanted to spend fanmail. Alas, as far as anyone could tell, everyone liked the shows about equally - each of us got around 2-3 pieces of each other's fanmail.<br/><br/>In the end, people were having too much fun with our single episode and since it was the last event of the show, everyone wanted to take some time to get in the last sliver of shopping and say their farewells, so we never did the next episode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237410/#Comment_237410" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T09:39:21+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  9:39AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>You'll see what the fuck I mean by that when the One Cool Thing video is up.</blockquote>\nYesssssssss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237421/#Comment_237421" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T09:55:10+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  9:55AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10704" rel="nofollow">Done</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238615/#Comment_238615" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-21T15:01:32+00:00" title="October 21, 2009  3:01PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't even seem possible, but there is only ONE picture anyone has put online of me running ANY of these games:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/saga_rincon/4027490920/" rel="nofollow">Here we are</a> playing Penny For My Thoughts, the Satan/England version.

You may find yourself in another part of the Galaxy... You may find yourself behind the controls of a captured Imperial shuttle... You may find yourself on a beautiful Rebel Alliance Intel mission...with a beautiful partner...and you may say to yourself...'How did I get here?'" In 1987, the Star Wars roleplaying game broke new ground. It would carry the Star Wars banner for nearly 15 years based on the classic trilogy of movies. Now experience the brilliant d6 system in this exciting session. It was just an ordinary assignment for low-ranking Alliance Intelligence officers, posting in a captured Imperial intelligence space station far from civilization. But when events take an unexpected turn, the handful of ragtag heroes find the fate of the galaxy on their shoulders. Same as it ever was...same as it ever was...<br/><br/>The main conceit I am using for this game is that I am running it as if it was 1987 and Empire Strikes Back had just come out. "I can't wait to see Revenge of the Jedi! That's what Fangoria said it would be called."<br/><br/>Friday, 6-10 PM - Remember Tomorrow - <a href="http://rincongames.com/eventdetails.php?eventid=9" rel="nofollow">Adventures in the Near Future</a><br/><br/>20 Minutes From Now...a memory courier wakes in his airport coffin hotel. 20 Minutes From Now...a flying car's windows glide down to reveal gang members with submachine guns. 20 Minutes From Now...you realize that when she left, she took your security card, and hear the sirens getting nearer. Remember Tomorrow is a game of cyberpunk short stories set in the near future. Generate a character at the table and see if they can reach their dream, when they're Ready, Willing and Able. Face-offs and backroom deals make this innovative game a brilliant introduction to short-form gaming. No prior experience necessary.<br/><br/>Friday, 10 PM - 2 AM - Pokethulu - <a href="http://rincongames.com/eventdetails.php?eventid=13" rel="nofollow">Squamous attacks are super effective!</a><br/><br/>"That is not dead which can eternal lie / and with strange aeons, even death may die! / To bring down our masters on an icy night / And to claim the power when the stars are right!

Amid the sagging gables of old New England, evil lurks. Grownups hide in terror, but you're 10 years old and know how to use your Shining Dodecahedron to capture the skulking Pokethulhu and do battle to become the next big hero! Come and play Pokethulhu, no prior experience necessary and characters can easily be made at the table.<br/><br/>Saturday 10 AM - 2 PM - Fiasco - <a href="http://rincongames.com/eventdetails.php?eventid=283" rel="nofollow">In A Nice Southern Town</a><br/><br/>Beyond disaster...past a catastrophe...there is only a Fiasco. In a Nice Southern Town, people still have big ambitions and poor impulse control. If you like Coen Brothers movies, you owe it to yourself to come and experience the latest Bully Pulpit Game, a short-form story RPG in which the tangled drives of the characters escalate from mere misfortune to crazed blunders and finally, the ultimate Fiasco.<br/><br/>Saturday 2 PM - 6 PM - Call of Cthulhu - <a href="http://rincongames.com/eventdetails.php?eventid=284" rel="nofollow">Sevastopol 1923</a><br/><br/>Lenin is on his deathbed. In Moscow the Central Committee uneasily watches the power shift between Stalin, Bukharin and Zinoviev. But far from the intrigues of the General Assembly, the Ukraine and Crimea slowly recover from a horrific famine. In Sevastopol, the traitor Wrangel's fleet is being torn apart for salvage and the city is vulnerable. Unusual, unexplained events which the local authorities seem unable to address have prompted the Central Committee to authorize an investigation. Although counter-revolutionary forces are to be sought out and uncovered for the good of the working people, the political situation is very sensitive and Lenin's policy of Ukrainization is not to be disturbed. The Politburo is counting on you, comrade. Udaci! Good luck!<br/><br/>Saturday 10 PM - 2 AM - Ghostbusters International - <a href="http://rincongames.com/eventdetails.php?eventid=285" rel="nofollow">Miami</a><br/><br/>Last year at RinCon we learned the Ghostbusters tried to open up a new franchise in a place where all second franchises are opened - Miami! But too many sunglasses and people yelling "YEEAAAH" led to everyone being fired after only completing one actual contract. The franchise was written off as a complete loss for tax purposes. But now they're giving it another try, as ghosts and spirits flocked to the now-Ghostbuster-less city and the cry went up: "Who ya gonna call?" Get your proton packs out of mothballs and don't look directly into the trap, because GBI: Miami rides again!<br/><br/>Last year's character creation was a "team building" session. This years is going to be a revival preacher denouncing the Ghost-bust-ters-ZAH, by name, and "inviting testimony."<br/><br/>Sunday 10 AM - 12 PM - The Second Second <a href="http://rincongames.com/eventdetails.php?eventid=3" rel="nofollow">GM's Conference</a> <br/><br/>The Southern Arizona Gamemaster's Conference has offered ideas, training and discussion for over a year, and it returns to RinCon for a second session. Our presentations this year include many special RPG Guests: John Wick, a returning favorite of the SAGC, will present "Play Dirty: The Con Man". This will be a revved up and revamped version of what he presented at the first Gamemaster's Conference, so long-time attendees will have a special treat, and first-time attendees will be blown away (we already know.) Ryan Macklin will be our keynote speaker, and he will talk about "Creating Context Quickly and Collaboratively", turning the first 30 minutes of a session into a rich setting for play. Since his Dresden Files RPG has a much-celebrated setting creation system, he is sure to have some exciting insights. Paul Tevis, another special RPG guest and creator of the innovative Penny For My Thoughts, will talk about "What Improv Taught Me About GMing", a topic which many at previous conferences have expressed interest in. There will also be an announcement of the next standalone conference!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295319/#Comment_295319" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-30T05:26:48+00:00" title="September 30, 2010  5:26AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, you are a superstar.

Here's how it went:<br/><br/>Star Wars d6: Terrific, more technical and skill checks than a shootout, lots of "let's con the Imperials THIS way now!"<br/><br/>Remember Tomorrow: Went well, with RinCon indie superstars Morgan and Brian, but potentially I need to consume the rules a second time.<br/><br/>Pokethulu: Great.<br/><br/>Fiasco: A crowd pleaser, with a story of the corruption of the evil superintendent of schools and her corrupt sheriff partner.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu: Really good investigational stuff, they really enjoyed the mix of personalities and viewpoints in Sevastopol 1923. Included someone who had never roleplayed before, as well as Eric Boyd.<br/><br/>Ghostbusters International: Included a guy who played in costume, Eric, and pretty much a full table! Pretty amazing,  a lot of banter and characterizations.<br/><br/>GM's Conference: Went great, I should do a long post on why I disagree with all of John Wick's conclusions, but he, Ryan Macklin and Paul Tevis were tremendous, as always.<br/><br/>Paul also did this really interesting GM's Clinic thing, we discussed it afterwards, I think it might be the start of something good. Will post more when con amnesia wears off.<br/><br/>So I am now going to award the HEROES OF THE CONVENTION AWARD:<br/><br/><b>Morgan Ellis and Matt Grau</b><br/><br/>Ryan Macklin's "play with the creator" Dresden Files game was so oversubscribed that it had two people on standby 2 months ago. He had 13 people show up to the table.  Now, I'm of the view that if you want 6 players, you run your table with 6 players, numbers 7-13 are out of luck.  But one of those potential players Morgan Ellis, who took 6 of the players aside and ran an entire second table of Dresden Files, off the cuff, instantly doubling the awesomeness.<br/><br/>Similarly, Matt Grau was signed up to run a "play with the creator" Cthulutech game. If you haven't checked out Cthulhutech, you really should - and a LOT of people at the con wanted to check it out.  He also had a 5 person table become a 9 person table.  And he just took it in stride, said, "Give me a sec to write up some new character sheets" and he took everyone in. They all came away enthused and happy.<br/><br/>For taking on more players and getting them in more games than is humanly reasonable, Morgan and Matt are HEROES OF RINCON.<br/><br/>Because of that they got a FREE DINNER at <a href="http://elguerocanelo.com/" rel="nofollow">El Guero Canelo</a>.  (Matt chose to cash his in later.)<br/><br/>Edit: Thanks to all the whispers (there were many), pointing out I got Morgan's name wrong, due to con amnesia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336278/#Comment_336278" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-28T13:21:17+00:00" title="July 28, 2011  1:21PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And now Part 3: RinCon 11!
