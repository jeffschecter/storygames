During this scene, we used Mob Justice\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Poker mechanic for Skirmish resolution quite heavily, although we didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t focus on the Story Chips.  Our gaming group has several Poker fiends in it, so this worked out truly well.  It was a little trick the game allowed me to pull a few times during our playtest and more often in our regular game.<br/><br/>Once Jocelyn explains what is at stake, her old friend \xe2\u20ac\u0153Big Gene\xe2\u20ac\x9d agrees to help out.  He is both a bootlegger and amateur demolition expert.  He says he knows how to deal with Isenberg\xe2\u20ac\u2122s superior <b>numbers</b> and firepower.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>Tullio and August deal with three captives from the previous game.  Tullio, well, Mike can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t seem to break the \xe2\u20ac\u0153bad cop\xe2\u20ac\x9d he has captured.  When August goes in, takes advantage of Mob Justice\xe2\u20ac\u2122s rules in regards to Extras (or Mooks), and also uses the player-assist rules to make short work of his Ask \xe2\u20ac\u02dcEm Hard draws.  This cop doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know much, but he knows where Isenberg can be found.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The gang gathered together at Cadenza\xe2\u20ac\u2122s (the brothel/speakeasy) to discuss how they would go through this.  At one point during our playtest, Mike suggested we have a full Italian dinner in our characters\xe2\u20ac\u2122 attire.  Although we didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t pull off wardrobe, we did roleplay this scene over dinner.  It caused this scene (and the entire game) to last much longer than I wanted, but the overall effect made it worthwhile.  My days of running games for twelve hours has passed.  I prefer to run four hour games, but dinner made this finale last six hours.<br/><br/>After dinner, the characters went their own ways in order to discuss their own angles (particularly Morelli).  <br/><br/>When Tullio and August emerged from Cadenza\xe2\u20ac\u2122s, Tomasso was waiting for them.  One thing I really like about Mob Justice is its damage resolution.  For those who don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know, the winning character in a fight measures the ranks of his poker hand above his defender.  They then apply the weapon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s damage.  These ranks plus damage equal the number of cards a player draws.  For each Heart (in a physical damage) the defender takes a wound.  It can make some insane thing happen, but mostly works out.  For example, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve seen 12 cards drawn without a single heart.  It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s good for a laugh.<br/><br/>The fight ends with August dead (I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m a cocky player) and Tomasso wounded.  Tullio stands over him while Tomasso all but cries.<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\u0153I did it for my family,\xe2\u20ac\x9d he pleads.<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\u0153Me too,\xe2\u20ac\x9d Tullio replies cooly before finishing him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>August\xe2\u20ac\u2122s death doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t deter the others from getting their vengeance on.  Messina and Morelli take barrels of alcohol with tricked-out bottoms of explosives to Isenberg\xe2\u20ac\u2122s home.  He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s planning on throwing a huge party (he considered August the most likely to kill him).  While they drop off the illicit goods, the others slip in.  The plan holds that the booze runners will leave, circle back, and join in on the fun.<br/><br/>When the two of them leave, Morelli tells Messina that they should just leave the three of them I there to die.  If \xe2\u20ac\u0153Big Gene\xe2\u20ac\x9d is put down, he\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be in a position to take his turf (or Network, Status, and Reputation in game terms).  Messina isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t cool with this and puts up a fight.  Words lead to bullets, which leads to Messina being marked out.  Morelli fires two shots into himself to show that he put up a fight himself.  The story of coming in with gun\xe2\u20ac\u2122s blazing already fills his head.  Alan was sweating that Mic\xe2\u20ac\u2122s character would make it through the fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The final battle between Tullio, Jocelyn, and Gino against Isenberg and his men goes down quite well.  Mob Justice approaches mass combat in a way similar to Savage Worlds.  Extras who take hits in the game are pretty much narrated out.  It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the fight with Bit Players and Leads that can really make things go unexpectedly (not to mention player-versus-player conflicts).   The fight ended with Tullio and Jocelyn standing.  Gino went down putting the big hurt on Isenberg.  Jocelyn tried to convince Tullio to let her \xe2\u20ac\u0153ruin\xe2\u20ac\x9d Isenberg (use your imagination and you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re probably still not right), but he said he\xe2\u20ac\u2122d never be able to rise in the city while Isenberg drew breath.<br/><br/>And so Isenberg quit drawing breath.<br/><br/>This was the last game we used these characters.  Out of playtest, out of the question.  Those characters went on to bigger, bolder things.  Morelli went a darker route, which was cool upon cool.  I did warn the players that surviving characters would show up in our regular games as NPCs though, which I will say is a neat little trick to try out on players sometime.<b></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
