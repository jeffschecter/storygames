<p>Turtle players are those that, when presented with risk or the appearance of risk, retreat into an impregnable shell.  They can drain a game of fun in about no time flat.  If you haven't ever encountered one then I recommend several of the other lovely threads in the forum, because I'm not going to argue about whether or not they exist (though I'll certainly discuss their origin and nature if people have thoughts).</p>
<p>My question is the perennial question:  How do you prevent such play from ruining your fun as a GM?</p>
<p>There seem (to me) to be several entirely different ways you could go about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to "reform" the turtle players behavior to make him more willing to take chances (a dicey proposition at best)</li>
<li>Find a way, as GM, to enjoy torturing the turtle player, often by beating on his shell with a sledge-hammer and watching him frantically patch it</li>
<li>Brick over the neck-hole of the shell, disempower the player as much as you need to, and then have fun with the other players until such time as the turtle player breaks out of the prison you've built around him (if he ever does)</li>
</ul>
<p>Do other folks have other ways they've dealt with it?</p>
<p>Also,do you think that as GMs we have any moral obligation to try to either (a) change our players so that they are people who can have fun in our game or (b) change our game so that it is one that the people we have can have fun with?  How far does that moral obligation extend, if it gets ... y'know ... <em>really, really hard</em> to do?</p>

                            Fred, <br/><br/>I agree with much of what you say. But there is a counter proposition to be faced: I come to a game table for energy, engagement, and enthusiasm. As a GM I am a momentum and energy slut -- I need to have the game be moving and the players be pushing and pulling and screaming and telling each other cool stuff they have to do if I'm going to ge the most out of the game. Without that I'll be left flat as a GM, and feel my fun melt off. <br/><br/>So while I know that there isn't anything wrong with folks who turtle up in the aboslute sense, there is something wrong with having one at my table when I GM. All too often they become the energy sink, the hole down which my energy and enthusiasm gets poured, only to have nothing returned to me. So, figuring out how to deal with folks like that can be an issue for me. <br/><br/>I've had mixed luck with one of my old turtles in getting them to non-turtle in their participation OOCly and collaberatively in the game. By making an energetic, trusting group around the table I've been able to get this particular one to engage in the brain-storming and idea mongering that goes about around scenes. Ask for ideas OOC or help setting a scene and this turtle is there and ready to rock. But once you get IC, the head goes into the shell and won't come out. And my read on this player is that Tony's methods wouldn't work -- and may in fact cause a reversal of the OOC trust that we've managed to build. <br/><br/>There is another turtle that I don't play with anymore, however, whose point of play seemed to be something like Tony's second point. It was some freakish form of gamism, where the turtle was less tortoise than tank. The player would make these untouchable characters and pull in, and then wouldn't be happy until you were pouring everything you had in on top of the shell to batter it into nothingness. The point of the game seemed to be trying to force the characer to react while he tried to keep his character from reacting. So Tony's method could have worked there. I just couldn't find a way to make it feel like anything but a dysfunctional relationship, and so eventually I stopped GMing for that player. <br/><br/>Tony, <br/><br/>I find your questions very interesting. Of course, being me I have to say "It really depends." <br/><br/>Remember the Trollbabe with Z post I did on the Forge? Z had been a turtle for years. Z was also my brother, and was a turtle (in very large part) because of shit I had done to him as a player over the years. I would say that I had an obligation to Z to try and find a way that we could play together and have fun. And yes, I did think of it as "fixing" him -- fucked up as that may be, it's the honest truth about the way it was. <br/><br/>The funny thing is that I used to try to change my games to make them fun to play with him. (After I got over my abusive asshole GM days, before I got into my trendy hippy manly queer virago days.) But it never worked out. Maybe it was because our dynamic was too fubared to be fixed without time, maybe because I'm just as inflexible as he is. I can't have fun in the safe game with the obvious answers any more than he could have fun in the non-safe game with no good answers. So finding a middle ground was hard as hell. <br/><br/>Luckily, that story has a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18998.0" rel="nofollow">happy ending</a> of father and son battling to the death. <br/><br/>OTOH, as I said above, I have had players that I've ended up ditching because we couldn't find a way to make our games work. I'd say in the old days, when I did this without ever clearly expressing to them what I needed out of game and getting them to do the same back, that it was fucked up. I probably should have been more open and honest with them -- even if it was hard. <br/><br/>These days, however, I don't start a game without being honest about what I need and doing my best to get the players to be honest about what they need. If, after having agreed to things up front we can't make it work or people aren't delivering what they promised to deliver, I'll talk to them open and honest. If it still doesn't work, I'll call it off open and honest. It's one of the few ways I know how to deal with a turtle, as the other games tend to not be fun for long. <br/><br/>And if they aren't family, then my sense of obligation goes down. Fast. <br/><br/>Tony, did I get at most of your questions? Anything more you'd like to hear?                        </div>

                            Would the "standard Forge answer" be that turtles are clearly playing with a different agenda, and that you should find other players to play with? And if you are one big softie, you might try first to discuss and reconcile the different play expectations in the group, but if that is not possible...<br/><br/>Anyway, in my main group there are a couple of turtlish players, but so far we have managed to accommodate each other.                        </div>

<p><code>Your post, Tony, presupposes that there's something WRONG with sitting back, participating on a minimal level, and enjoying the show.</code></p>
<p>Fred, I get why you'd think that, but I don't feel that I'm actually saying that.  I'm saying "Man, a turtle player can make me have less fun as a GM."  That doesn't mean they're doing anything wrong, unless you assume that it is the player's obligation to make the GM have fun.</p>
<p>Which, first off ... how cool would that be?</p>
<p>But yeah, they're not doing anything wrong, and I still want to change the dynamic.  Your point raises another way to do that, which I didn't list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to "reform" your own perceptions so that you find dealing with the turtling behavior fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have recommendations on how to do that?</p>

<p>Brand, Mikael:  It sounds to me like you're roughly saying "Y'know, you don't <em>have to</em> fix this problem in a way that keeps both you and the turtle in the same game."  That's really, really true.  But I'd like to examine the possibilities for doing it that way, and see if anyone has figured out anything new since the last time we all talked about it.  Call it a spot-check on an issue that retains relevance for me.</p>

                            I think my answer is kind of uninteresting, which is this: there are no turtle players in my group, because I interviewed players before allowing them to join us, and made it clear that we're not looking for players who don't take risks.  I would not allow a turtle player to join us.  Let them find their own group - I do feel like I have an obligation to my players, so I just make sure that I have no players in the group that I couldn't deal with!<br/>
<br/>
(I know that interviewing sounds absolutely horrible and elitist, but we'd just moved to New York and knew no one and were putting together a group from scratch.  Interviewing helped us find amazing players who have also, over the last four years, become our best friends.  Chris jokes that we're the only people he knows who interviewed for friends when we didn't really have any!)                        </div>

                            The discussions of turtle players is one of the few genuinely great things I got out of the Forge, it's damn good, I've seen them, and yes, they can drain you. <br/>
<br/>
Ignoring them makes them miserable, typically, and if, like me, you're an altruistic GM that gets his kicks from watching everyone be happy, you can't just leave them alone.<br/>
<br/>
I have a player who I call the "space wuss" in our Star Wars d20 game, that is, whenever we're faced with a tight situation, immediately starts critiquing everyone's ideas really truly viciously - this is the extroverted member of the turtle species, the one which is only happy if the rest of the group is in the shell too.  He's gotten significantly better after I called him on it a while back, but he backslides, a lot. It's because he's charismatic, has a nasty sense of wit and loves to play "the cynical guy".  In the game that I first noticed this behavior in, I started railroading, uh, I mean scene framing, to the Nth degree, I didn't give him a choice about whether to be involved and I didn't give them a choice about what their plan was. It was always a good pland and it was always good to be involved, so once people got used to it, they liked it. He even liked it. He could say "I told you so" without ever telling people so.                        </div>

<p>'course I worry that he's gonna start stomping on the pure, uncut discussion with "me too" fillers and social stuff.

                            Tony, way back upthread I was channelling my forty years of therapy.<br/>
<br/>
There's this thing that happens in therapy.  I think it's pretty cool, actually, in that it gets right to the heart of what you can change and what you can't.<br/>
<br/>
"Doctor, doctor!  When person X does thing Y, I feel Z!  I don't want to feel Z!  What do I do?"<br/>
<br/>
"Well, what is it about you that makes you feel Z?  Is it only person X, or would you feel that way whenever anyone does Y?  Can you change the way you feel about Y?  If not, can you change your interaction with X?"<br/>
<br/>
When someone complains to a counselor about their problems with another person, the counselor always turns the question around to what you can change about YOURSELF to deal with the problem.                        </div>

                            It may be that the turtle player is capable of dealing with certain kinds of risks, but not others.  Maybe they can engage with emotional risk but not physical ones, or vice versa.  Maybe they're capable of acting on someone else's behalf, but not their own.  Maybe they can follow an order, but not take initiative.  In other words, maybe it's possible the turtleing isnt universal, and there are circumstances that they feel gives them permission to unlock themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I once played a game where th GM's promise was: I will not kill you.  I will chop off your limbs, set you on fire, render you penniless, kill your loved ones, give you permanent brain damage, make you hated by small children, but I won't out and out snuff the character.<br/>
<br/>
And that was freeing, oddly, even when some of our characters were reduced to unplayability, dead in all but name.  In my experience, a lot of turtles are reacting to previous GM abuse, or even previous real life abuse, and the stakes are a lot higher for them than the GM thinking of their own fun can imagine.                        </div>

                            Tony... if I had the answer to that, I'd be making millions in the self-improvement biz.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that everyone seems to have a DIFFERENT answer, and that it usually takes lots of 1-1 interaction with experts with lots of letters after their names to get any results, says to me that it isn't easy.<br/>
<br/>
The first requirement to changing how you think and feel, as the old joke goes, is to WANT to change.<br/>
<br/>
The second requirement is to be able to imagine how it is, to think and feel the way you want to.<br/>
<br/>
The third requirement is to be able to pretend that you actually do think and feel the way you want to.<br/>
<br/>
This is called the "Fake it 'til you make it" school of self-actualization.  I'm not saying it's the only way, and I'm not saying it works particularly well, but it has worked for me.                        </div>

                            Sure, there are different circumstances that will trigger turtling in "borderline cases", after all, there's never going to be a clear line between turtling and just being cautious, it's a broad spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
I want to throw in something that I've observed to attach onto the side of the motivation for turtling that's previously been identified. I fully agree that a lot of turtles get how they are because of bad experiences in the past, where they were trying to not be turtles and got savagely punished. But there's one word that you can add in that makes things even more turtly: deconstruction.<br/>
<br/>
You'll find that turtles are most often the ones not interested in celebrating source material as much as breaking it down and deconstructing it, pointing out the seams rather than breezing over them, and so on.  After all, being cynical and breaking down what others are building is easier than contributing and it doesn't expose you.  So you'll often find turtles sniping away at genre conventions, complaining with villains make dramatic escapes in stylized games, refusing to go on the good king's quest to slay the dragon, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
There's a lesser form of turtling that is Reluctant Hero Syndrome which turtles will often lay claim to when cornered. More on this later, perhaps.                        </div>

                            JD, <br/><br/>Fascinating!<br/><br/>So, could you turn this type of deconstructionist trutle's energy to good use? Such as getting them to deconstruct from the indside? Have them do a Dark Knight Returns or Watchmen, and actually make a dramatic statement about their deconstruction? <br/><br/>Or is it more about being negative as a way to not contribute to the game? <br/><br/>And, yes, reluctant hero syndrome is another good point. I've dealt with that in the past by drawing a line between a relectuant character and a reluctant player. My "still play with turtle" up above is one such -- her characters are always reluctant, but the player often isn't. Now if I can just get her to use her skills to move her own part of the story, rather than just moving other's. <br/><br/>Anyone have any advice on that part?                        </div>

                            That's true.  Whether it's a genuine reaction or a rationalization, some turtles at least really have a lot of trouble embracing the conventions of the genre or the setting, especially when such conventions aren't very naturalistic.  I mean, everyone knows a lot of bog standard gaming behavior is, by "real world" standards kind of crazy or stupid or perverse (Go into a dark cave. To fight a fire breathing dragon.  Armed with..a sword.  Shyeah, no.)  And sometimes turtles will just not buy in.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe smaller risks?  Or a little railroading that leads to positive results?  Demonstrate to the turtle that risk actually can have rewards?<br/>
<br/>
Also, in some games perhaps turtleing is less deadly?  I'm not just thinking turtleing, but really just about any situation where a player or two in the group will not or cannot engage fully.  Find games or situations where support characters can contribute fairly fully, and there's little or nothing driving them into the spotlight. (My brain is blanking on good examples.  Maybe..letting people be perma-non-wizards in Ars Magica?)<br/>
<br/>
Hm.  Does anyone here watch or have familiarity with the Stargate franchise?  Is there a way to craft satisfying games that let people be Walter Harriman (the control room guy who relays communications and conducts the Stargate openings and closings) or Sgt Siler (laconic but lovable engineer who fixes what's broken), or Dr. Lee (second string scientist with wacky theories), rather than one of the main 4 gun toting world saving people?  It's not typical, maybe it seems awkward at first blush, but..I dunno.  The characters themselves are beloved in the fandom, there's got to be some value there that can be gamed with.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought is, let a turtle-minded player play a character that's older, perhaps perceived as over the hill.  Take the emotional onus of being young and dynamic off of them, and move them into a mindset thats slightly more mentor-y, even if that's curmudgeonly.  Maybe then they'll decide to aim for awesomeness, not because it's expected of them, but because they have reason built into the character to resent being perceived as incapable of being awesome.                        </div>

                            The good thing about scene framing is you can just fiat that the character is WAY beyond the comfort zone of the turtle player AND that the character is fucking awesome. If you start halfway through the battle with the dragon and describe how the character's totally kicking its scaly ass, they can't complain that you're screwing them with the railroading.  In other words, in the past, the turtle has learned that trying to be awesome = punishment. By scene framing you can disconnect that: being awesome = reward.                        </div>

                            One of the players in my Jedi Dogs game was a definite "deconstructionist" as the term has been used here.  He's openly scornful of the Jedi traditions, suspicious of their motives, and generally considers them an equal evil to the Sith.  During the talk-up of the Jedi Dogs game he made this perfectly clear.<br/>
<br/>
I challenged him to put aside his cynicism for the game, to play it, as you say, "from the inside".  He stepped up to the challenge, and made a "True Blue" Jedi, who was a believer in the hierarchy.  It will be interesting to watch.                        </div>

This makes it hard to enjoy baseball.  What do I do?"<br/><br/>This is what you do: you take the player aside, put your hand on his shoulder, and tell him earnestly, "Hey, we're playing baseball here, not football.  I know you have lots of experience with football, and you've trained and drilled to be a good football player, and you know all the plays and all that, but this is baseball, and it has different rules.  I'd really like to play baseball with you, because I think we'd both have lots of fun.  Maybe some other time we can play football, but right here and right now, we're playing baseball, and that means you need to play by baseball rules.

                            The analogy doesn't hold. As I said above, there's no clear line between turtling and being cautious. In fact, many groups actively enjoy play that I would consider ridiculously cautious and tedious. Checking every door for traps in D&amp;D, distrusting all NPCs to a huge degree...I've played in groups where this was done with all the pleasure of reading Tom Clancy spy technothrillers. I have the same reaction to those groups' play as to reading those novels: get to the shooting. A player who consistently did that would be turtling, to me, but would be playing correctly, to others.<br/>

They did learn it somewhere, there are turtles that were postiively reinforced to be turtles as well as those that were punished into it.                        </div>

                            Yes, JD, and that was a different game.<br/><br/>What is the origin of this assumption that every game you play is all part of the same activity?<br/><br/>If I'm running 7th Sea, I expect players to be flamboyant and swing on chandeliers.  If I'm running Star Trek, I expect players to be cautious and discuss their plans of action (and wrestle with the moral quandaries involved).<br/><br/>However, if I'm running 7th Sea and one of the players keeps worrying about the moral repercussions of his actions, I'm going to be annoyed.  I'm going to be exactly as annoyed as when I'm running Star Trek and one of the players is swinging on the chandeliers.<br/><br/>Point being, expectations should not be imported from one game to the other.                        </div>

                            I see what you're saying, JBR, I just don't think the analogy is accurate or contributes much. If there's a continuum of behaviors between mine and those super-cautious super-tactical folks, and there seems to be, there would be a continuum of games between baseball and football such that you could change just a tiny bit of baseball to make it more footballish, and then a bit more and a bit more and a bit more, and at every step have a feasible game.  At this point the analogy is getting more outlandish than the reality and it doesn't help.                        </div>

                            No, Vax, because as JD points out, they learned that behavior <em>and were rewarded for that behavior</em> somewhere else.  Turtling is the "right" thing to do in some games (some games that you may or may not think are abusive and dysfunctional, but games in their history nonetheless).  The problem isn't that they're "playing the game wrong", the problem is that they're <em>playing the wrong game</em>.<br/><br/>So unless you're suggesting that your right fielder is used to playing Dodgeball, I don't see what you're getting at.                        </div>

                            Well, I think maybe there's more than one way to turtle, or more than one reason to turtle.<br/>
<br/>
There's "afraid to act/unwilling to risk, because risk itself is dangerous or unrewarding"<br/>
<br/>
There's "disagreeing with the philosophy of agency in the game"<br/>
<br/>
There's "not understanding the breadth of agency available to them and unwilling to experiment to find those limits"<br/>
<br/>
There's "slow or unimaginative thinker left in the dust by the pace of the game/wit of the other players, and now settled into passivity"<br/>

Even "takes real pleasure in caution/passivity/muted reactivity."<br/>
<br/>
Different causes or motivations, different solutions (assuming for the sake of the thread that it needs solving.)<br/>
<br/>
Is it problematic because it's maddening passive?  A dramatic nullset?  Is it problematic because it's disruptive?  A different game being played than everyone else?                        </div>

                            Telepresence -<br/><br/>I think that's very insightful.  Each of those kinds of turtles probably needs a different kind of help from the other players and the GM in order to be effective in the game.<br/><br/>I definitely have players who enjoyed the pleasure of caution/muted reactivity, but I didn't even consider them turtles until this moment - because they're not problematic players in our group.<br/><br/>That's because they're willing to use their drive toward caution to create, rather than oppose, story - and because they're willing to compromise with other players.  So, for example, we might spend an hour of session setting up a safe way for the PCs to meet with their deadliest enemy, and half the group will really enjoy the planning and the thinking-through - and then they're willing to go balls-out into the actual meeting with the enemy, because they're actually able to enjoy other kinds of play as well, and they can see that it's time for the group to do something different.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I'd say that it's only a problem when it collides with the play styles/expectations of the rest of the group.                        </div>

                            Did we just decide that another term is useless?  Or at best misleading?<br/>
<br/>
Because I strongly agree with telepresence's assessment, and amplification seems obvious ("space-wuss", the paralized planner, etc.)  But really, some of those Dao of Turtle are issues, some not, some indicate a call to action on the part of the group, some don't, and the "right action," if there is one, in each case is different.<br/>
<br/>
So is it useful for me to say, for instance that I have a turtle in my game who's sort of left behind by the rest of the group, or shouldn't I just call them a player who's left behind?<br/>
<br/>
In other words, it seems like the behavior we call turtling has causes that are so diverse as to be unrelated.  A player who's feeling left out or confused and needs a little coaxing is a whole different animal than one who won't risk because other games have equated risk and loss of narrative control.  Why do we call them both turtles?<br/>
<br/>
Or, ought turtle really only refer to the player who is adverse to character risk, possibly as the result of training in whatever games (be they football, or "Oh, you want to stand up to the dragon, huh?  New character!"-style D&amp;D).                        </div>

                            Word.  I turtle when I'm sorta uncomfortable with the way play is going or just flat-out confused or lost, but not so uncomfortable that I think it's worthwhile putting the breaks on everyone else's fun to talk about it.  So I shut up and hope it gets better, but, in the meantime, I don't feel comfortable actively participating.  This can turn into momentary, short-term, or long-term turtling, but, when playing with people who I've got a good relationship with, I can usually avoid the longer stuff by actually getting up the nerve to say "wait a minute."  With people I don't really know, I may be out the rest of the game.                        </div>

                            So maybe we want to have a turtle taxonomy, like the risk-turtle who turtles to avoid their character getting hurt in any way, or the anger-turtle who turtles when they're not happy with what's going on, or whatever.  That might be a useful way to talk about solutions to turtle behavior (in groups where a solution is necessary) - figure out what kind of turtle you have, then try to deal with the underlying issue.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>I don't know ... the taxonomy feeds into whole aristotelean concept of pigeonholing things into mutually exclusive categories that cover the entire space ... and I therefore distrust it.  Because, honestly, that type of analysis helps <em>sometimes</em> but it is used <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<p>I suspect that it wouldn't be all that helpful here.  I think I'm with Joshua and Jonathan:  <em>Turtle</em> as a verb is pretty clear.  We know it when we see it, we know it when we do it.  <em>Turtle</em> as a noun that means "one who is currently turtling" ... also fine.  <em>Turtle</em> as a noun that means "one who is defined by their turtling"?  Not so helpful.</p>
<p>If you say "I was playing along, and suddenly one of my players totally turtled," then it prompts the <strong>right</strong> next question:  "Do you have any idea why they did it?"</p>

                            I don't know about that. The main issue in general is the bloody turtle just won't speak up. The exact reason why won't get hashed out until the guy finally speaks up about the problem in the first place, right.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, if you confront the turtle about the problem, he's likely to turtle up and it'll only piss you off more because that jackass won't even meet you halfway when you're trying to help him... turtle. I mean turtle, not jackass.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I think that general-purpose ways to make people feel comfortable opening up is more likely to bear fruit that sitting around on a web forum coining clever names like "angry turtles" or "scared turtles" or "uncomfortable turtles who are uncomfortable because the GM's girlfriend with the piercings on her eyelids keep leaning close with the second button on her blouse open and she's like wearing no bra or patting his knee or passing him little love notes or nekkid pictures of herself or he once let slip that he likes the smell of strawberries so now she smells like a dang strawberry all the time or she cornered him in the bathroom once but he weaseled out of that because the GM is is friend and he don't wanna do that to the guy but mostly it's the eyerings. Ew."  That one is not a pleasant one to be, let me tells ya.<br/>
<br/>
So, basically, I would suggest giving the guy time, right. Rome was not built in a day. You can't force a guy to open up to you. but try to keep the lines of communication open. Gentle encouragement + time will likely get results.<br/>
<br/>
However, what's likely to happen is the guy is going to do a "test" thing on the communication. This will be your one shot because if you screw this up, he'll slam that door shut. But no pressure. What he'll do is make some kind of comment or suggestion. It'll likely be something small and probably not game-related like which restaurant the group orders from this week or what movies to rent on movie night or something like that.. This is his timid little signal to you that he's willing to make a suggestion in what the group does. My advice is to take that suggestion and go with it. You might have to make an effort to do so, like if he wants to order Indian food or rent Brain from the Planet Arous. But take his suggestion. This is your timid little signal back that his voice will be heard and it is indeed possible for his suggestions to be taken. This will make him feel better about himself and help him to open up more.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it may not always be possible to go with the suggestion, especially if you've got a whole room full of turtles, but try your best. They might slam the door, but in time it'll open again.<br/>
<br/>
it's all about making the guy feel comfortable with raising his concerns with you or the group and no one can make him do that. He has to do it himself. All you can do it be encouraging when he does try in a way that will make him likely try again. So, don't be dismissive, don't be condescending, don't crack jokes. You have to make like what he said matters and was taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
That's a lot more useful that working out an elaborate taxonomy. I mean, how would that help?                        </div>

                            My thought was that it would help us figure out specific ways of addressing the very different concerns of different people who are exhibiting the same behavior for different reasons.  In other words, to be able to say things like, "If this person is turtling because they aren't okay with the amount of agency they have, here's what you could do, but this stuff wouldn't work for someone who is turtling because they're socially uncomfortable."  But as you and Tony have pointed out, I'm not sure it does.                        </div>

                            You know what, I think Tony's right. <br/><br/>And now I look back at my post and see how many of my players I'm calling "turtle" rather than saying that they turtle, and I feel that my attitude is probably part of the issue. If I focused more on the pathology and less upon the label, perhaps it would yield better results. <br/><br/>Really, I think that might be part of what went on with Z in the Trollbabe game I linked to above. I spent a lot of time thinking about the specific patterns of his reactions, and was able to find ways to move around them. Sounds much like JD does the same. <br/><br/>So hey, this is probably a big "so what" moment for you guys, but I learned something!                        </div>

<i>My thought was that it would help us figure out specific ways of addressing the very different concerns of different people who are exhibiting the same behavior for different reasons. </i><br/><br/>*nods* I see.<br/><br/>The problem with that, of course, is that first you have to find out what the underlying cause is. Which, as I said, ain't always easy. With Ms Eyerings, I just said that I was sick of D&amp;D. And for two, you can't have a nice, pat answer for each problem because the people don't always react the same. Would be nice if they did, but they don't                        </div>

<p>See, Brand is using the word "pathology" and Jack is using the term "underlying cause."</p>
<p>It's just not fair.</p>
<p>Almost an hour ago I was all primed to write a post in which I talked about turtling behavior as a <em>symptom</em> of deeper dysfunction, rather than a dysfunction all on its own.  But then my wife needed me to go out to the store because she didn't have enough frozen cherries for the sauce she's making, and neither the first store nor the second store had it, in fact the store that had them was closed before I even left, so I called on the cell and she said just come home, I could get it tomorrow, but by the time I came home she'd decided to cut the cherries she <em>did</em> have with raspberries, and it tastes fine.</p>
<p>The upshot of it is I got scooped, and now instead of saying something original and having everyone say "Yeah, I was just thinking that," I'm reduced to complaining about a late-night shopping trip and admitting "Yeah, I was just thinking that."</p>
<p>I will lay claim to being the first one to recommend that the bull-sessions on <em>House</em> over "differential diagnosis" (whatever the hell that actually means) might be a good place to go searching for ways to think about such things.  'course, that's just because I <em>really</em> like Hugh Laurie, but that doesn't mean it's wrong.</p>
<p>The main take-away from House, for me, is that they never diagnose anything off of <strong>one</strong> symptom.  The first symptom always leads to a whole lists of things it <em>could</em> be.  Patient's bleeding through her eyes.  Could be tumor, could be viral, could be bacterial, could be allergies.  Check her saline solution, her prescription, run a TVT, boogie-screen and a chem-42.  Then you get that information back, and inevitably by then the patient is also siezing violently.  And House (because he's a right bastard) says "Bone-breaking seizures!  Great!  Now we can cross of bacterial and allergies."</p>
<p>So, I genuinely do think that this could be applied to dealing with behaviors like turtling.  You realize "Hey, this guy's turtling," and you immediately ask yourself "Well, what are his <em>other symptoms</em>."  Does he have angry outbursts?  Over what?  Does he contribute less than others in brain-storming?  More than others?</p>
<p>All that jazz.  Nice and clinical.  It won't work the way it sounds, with you as a detached observer sifting for truth, but it doesn't on <em>House</em> either, so that's okay.</p>

You can treat the other guy as a person and an equal and say, "This game expects you to do X, Y, and Z, and it doesn't work without you doing that."  And they either try to do so (if they try and fail, that's better than not trying at all) or they leave the game because it expects them to do stuff they're not interested in doing.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can take it upon yourself to be his RPG psychologist and convert him to your way of thinking as if it's the fundamentally better way to play RPGs, and that's... that's issues of your own, man.                        </div>

<p>I would view the one guy's turtling as a symptom being shown by <em>the group</em>.  Something is wrong with the group as a whole.  You can diagnose it.</p>
<p>Yeah, above I talked about "what are <em>his</em> other symptoms" but it's been, like, almost thirty minutes since then.  People grow.  People change.  Why can't we leave ancient history in the past?</p>

                            I occasionally get into major turtle modes; let me tell you about the last campaign I went turtle on.<br/>
<br/>
I was flaming out of grad school at the time.  I had an A.B.D. (All But Dissertation) and just couldn't bring myself to complete the D.  I was realizing my lifepath was wrong for me and I had to re-evaluate my whole life.<br/>
<br/>
At the time the GM I was playing for wanted to run characters that were going through major life changes, redefining their lives, all that good stuff, and I was thinking "SBJ I'm doing that 24/7 in real life, for vastly higher stakes than any RPG.  Can't I just, like, roll dice and kill monsters for a while?"<br/>
<br/>
What I wound up doing was dumping my original character, the one with all the life-path issues, and making a new character that was essentially a sentient magical anomaly.  I think it must have been the ultimate turtle character because <br/>
1) it took massive rules abuse to make the character.<br/>
2) the character had no emotional ties to anything.  I mean, this character had the "orphan loner ninja" beat like a gong for no plot hooks.<br/>
<br/>
And playing that character, pretending to be a ball of talking magic with no cares at all, gave me a desperately needed break from the sturm und drang of the rest of my life.                        </div>

Often times the response is an automatic invocation of "Reluctant Hero Syndrome", that pernicious strain of "My Guy Fever" but you'll get a response! Sometimes enough of a response that you can strike bargains the turtle-r will keep.                        </div>

Did I say "Take your sweaty plastic armor and go play over there?"  No no no -- please, I'm not over there on the extreme.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that: (a) games have expectations of their players and (b) sometimes the players aren't all on the same page as far as what those expectations even <em>are</em> and (c) the best way to fix that problem is to (drumroll please) <em>talk to your fellow players as equals</em>.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Funny enough, I was saying the same thing. Maybe the word pathology made me sound judgemental -- but I meant it in the context of forensics, rather than diseases. <br/><br/>My point was just like your point, but I'd add on to the end that sometimes just talking about it isn't enough. Especially when you have people in your game that you can't/won't let go easily or willingly. So when that happens you have to be willing to dig deeper, both into your expectations and needs and into theirs and their processes of play, in order to be able to find ways around the blocks. <br/><br/>Because much as we might like it if we were all really real adults in full control of all our issues and blocks and assumptions, we aren't. And so sometimes a simple frank diologue isn't enough. <br/><br/>Though I full agree it has to start with the diologue.                        </div>

                            I actually have to agree with Josh BR here. Like way back to the baseball/football metaphor. They've just learnt to play for a different game, and continue to assume that all games work that way. I'm not really sure that we need to play psychologist here and determine the precise nature of the dysfunction.<br/>
<br/>
That... or you could just be cruel and set up reverse-turtle stimuli in your game:<br/>
<br/>
  "There's a fire-breathing dragon? What do you do?"<br/>
  "I hide behind a rock and put my shield over my head!"<br/>
  "Oh really....? Well there's a landmine behind that rock! You die! Who's next?"<br/>
  "Uh... I charge forward and attack the dragon?"<br/>
  "Yes! I mean, sure. You charge in, and with one blow you slay the dragon! And you are the hero of the village, and you get piles of money and babes, and..."                        </div>
