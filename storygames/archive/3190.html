I am operating under a Benevolent President-Judge model for Bullseye (but that's a topic for another discussion). These are some general thoughts that have been brewing for me:<br/><br/>1) Limitation on Improvisation: Yes, utilization of a GM is inherently, at some measure, a limitation on player involvement. However, this involvment is itself inherently improvisational. Giving players the power to, e.g., build the game world, requires them to improvise those elements. One of the fundamental aspects of a traditional GM is significant preparation, e.g., at the most classic level, mapping out the dungeon. This concentrates pre-game effort into the hands of a single individual, which can be helpful--or even necessary--for many play groups. Not all players like or are even able to engage in the improvisation demanded by GM-less games.<br/><br/>2) The Labyrinthine Plot: When players build large parts of the story in play, it necessarily limits the complexity of the plot. It's far harder to spontaneously and collaboratively generate, e.g, an intricate web of courtly intrigue, backstabbing, and lies, than to script the framework of same ahead of time. I recognize that this can devolve into the functional equivalent of everyone sitting around while the GM reads the players his latest bit of fiction, but play styles should not be judged on their worst examples. While it may not be for all play groups, this sort of experience can generally only be achieved by utilizing a GM.<br/><br/>Thoughts on these topics? Other benefits of using a GM over GM-less play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72706/#Comment_72706" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T12:08:49+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 12:08PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Justin, I'm highly skeptical of your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  In my experience, I find the labyrinthine plot is more likely when you have five cooks for the soup improvising what goes in as it boils away.  The resulting plot may not be the elegant construction that a GM can <em>plan</em>, but I also have not seen those elegant GM plans actually come to fruition without significant in-play modification.<br/><br/>Others:<br/>3) Coordinated Logistics.  Often, the GM is also the host or player-wrangler.  "Hey, we're playing on Saturday."<br/><br/>4) Coordinated Spotlight Time.  The GM serves a very foundational role of directing the attention of the table to different players.  "Okay, what are you doing, Jim?  Now what are you doing, Sally?"  And so on.<br/><br/>5) Meting out Approval.  In any game where the GM either (a) awards XP/Plot Points or (b) can disregard mechanical resolution in favor of "a really good idea," the GM is distributing approval of player contributions.  He's saying, "Yes, that was a good idea" and by consequence, when something doesn't work or get a reward, "That was not a good idea."  Note this is hardly a criticism: there needs to be some way to sort between good and bad ideas and what is and is not a good contribution; making that one guy's job is a very functional and very easy way of providing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Multiple cooks with their multiple viewpoints and multiple imaginations firing can definitely come up with more vibrant/gonzo/multi-faceted/etc. plots even working in teh moment. But, perforce, a single author working <i>in advance</i> can come up with a more invisibly interconnected plot. (Of course, I'm speaking in generalities--but not inapropriate ones.) I don't like the terms myself, but you see the distinction you've helped illuminate right?<br/><br/>As for practical appearance in play, I only have my own experiences to rely on, and I can say I ran a 3-year D&amp;D campaign that did just that; <i>inter alia</i>, the island that was the site of the first adventure was critical to the killing the BBEG at level 20 ... and <i>not coincidentally so</i>. To man, the players were all <i>daaaaamn</i>. It was rewarding for all of us in a particular way that I <i>know</i> could not be emulated by GM-less play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72711/#Comment_72711" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T12:24:02+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 12:24PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm with Josh here. In fact I don't see item one as really being particularly applicable, either. That is, I think that the limit on the player is that his role is (usually) to enumerate the actions of a single character. It's not that the other stuff is reserved for the GM so much as he's being limited to the (very intuitive) role of directing the actions of just one character.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo add to Josh's list:<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Player with different play imperative. Players with characters generally either act as though they are the character, or they are advocates for the character. If there's nobody else to advocate for character adversity, often you have none. This is why in Universalis we had to reward adversity, since it was no one particular player's job to inject it. Drama comes about when you have a protagonist (somebody we like or can at least associate with ourselves somehow) who faces some sort of adversity that causes him to have to make choices that reveal who he really is. The player of the character provides the factors that make the character a protagonist. The GM provides the adversity. That's the main benefit of the role in most RPGs, to my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, you can distribute this role. But often it's best if it's left to one sole player who doesn't have any potential conflict of interest. Or, rather, who's only interest is in bettering the story produced by providing the adversity.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72712/#Comment_72712" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T12:24:57+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 12:24PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM plays the world to the player's character.

And it still doesn't offer the detailed narrative coherence that you have with a GM, and you're still working at a fairly high level of abstraction.

As a crappy analogy, it's the difference between you saying:<br/>\nIt's against the law to steal. Police have a job to enforce that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd me saying:<br/>\nWe don't steal because stealing is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the role of the GM that of police? That is, is the job of the GM to limit players, or do the players limit themselves? The problem with the former attitude is that it assumes that the GM knows better than the players. This attitude has arisen from problems due to conflicts in player interests in early RPGs. The games incentivize "abuse" so the GM must be there to limit what the player can reasonably do, using the argument of "This is what he would reasonably do" as the benchmark.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's unenforcable, and harmful to play. Possibly the single most damaging problem in RPGs ever, and has resulted in the death of innumerable groups of RPG players. I'm not saying this lightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the system in question incentivizes players to have their characters act like, well, interesting characters, then there's no need for the GM to limit the players. This is not part of his role. Quite simply I haven't done this in a RPG for years now.<br/>\n<br/>\nTruely abusive players are everyone's problem, not just the GM. It's a social level problem that has to be resolved outside of the game, and not by some game-given responsibility. Assuming that the players are playing non-abusively, there is no problem that requires a GM to solve. Unless the game is badly designed, and promotes bad play and requires the GM to fix it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real harm is that it puts in the GM's mind the notions like "players will never do something as productive as making plot, so I'll have to force one upon them." Basically in casting players as people who need to be controlled, you create an adversarialy relationship instead of one in which the players and GM are actually working together to produce something in play. And not in the sense of competitive, either, but more like adversaries in a courtroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if by "limit" you mean that in reserving certain rights for the GM that this automatically denies them to the players, and that this sort of limitation is good in that it gives players something to focus on? OK, sure. But, again, that's not the purpose of a GM, but an outcome of the split of the real duties. You're just saying what Elliot and I are saying in 6. The GM does something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nCall me touchy on this issue, but it's a biggie.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72724/#Comment_72724" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T12:55:12+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 12:55PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of following up the above post with another immediately...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Josh's point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, keep in mind that he's not saying that the GM does not create plot in this case.

One of the things our group talked about when we did the postmortem on our PTA games was how some players really didn't like what Elliot refers to above as "inconsistency" and "lack of secrets."  (And I should say that it didn't kill the game for us all on its own, but it was definitely part of the other mismatches between our group and PTA that did kill it.)<br><br>Our more traditional GM-driven games play out more like what Mike talks about earlier: the GM creates plots and at the same time accepts (and occasionally actively solicits) contributions from the players.  When combined with what Joshua described as the "meting out approval" role of a GM, this is <i>hugely</i> popular in our group...especially with certain GMs who have developed a reputation for being particularly good at using player contributions in unexpected but satisfying ways.<br><br>I suspect, though no one ever said it out loud, that part of the reason why some of our players strongly preferred the usual GM-driven games to our experiments in collaborative narration has to do with that "meting out approval"/impartial-judge thing.  We've got a few players who are genuinely good at improvising and developing plot, adversity, and ideas, but for various reasons (shyness or whatever) won't do it if they feel like they're being put on the spot.  For them, I think the thing that they appreciate most is being able to use the GM as a filter, a proxy between them and the spotlight: they use some back channel like e-mail or lunchtime conversation to get their idea to the GM, who then stands up in front of everyone else and incorporates that idea seamlessly into the game.  They're also putting their trust in the GM to use their idea if it's good, or to revise or even ignore it entirely if it isn't.  It's win-win for those players, because they they get to focus on the face-to-face element of gaming that they enjoy (typically playing their character/"avatarism") and get to have input on the other elements of the game without the pressure of the spotlight on them.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72741/#Comment_72741" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T13:43:34+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  1:43PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is probably a subset of one of the already mentioned things or a collection of some techniques, but:<br><br>GM can deliver his vision of the game (* by setting the mood, theme and play style.

But now that you put it that way, it makes sense.\n<blockquote>I think it is very tricky (not necessarily<em>impossible</em>, but certainly tricky) to have an imaginary space that maintains itself without conscious intervention.

Another thing is just what kind of content is updated; updating character actions does not require a lot of conscious thought on players behalf (as in thinking outside the context of character, which they are doing already if there's for example a dialogue going on), but updating things from players point of view - like thinking ahead about the scene or coming up with a new NPC - does require it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>The GM plays the world to the player's character. That's the general benefit.</blockquote>\nWhich, I think, is what Elliot says here. GM takes the burden of the conscious update of the imaginary space, so players don't have to. It's not exactly the same thing that happens in LARPs (lacking the physical feedback, taxing the GM who handles the rest of the world), but similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72839/#Comment_72839" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T07:33:32+00:00" title="May 31, 2007  7:33AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to add that LARPs are the only games I've ever been immersed in.

That's the model for the GM in Bullseye, and the "Judge" part is just that. I don't know why, but the governmental analogy struck a chord with me. The "President" part is the "executive branch" -- the GM enacts the rules (in the form of generating conflicts for play. The "Judge" part is the "judicial branch" -- the GM interprets the rules of play. The "legistlative branch" is intentionally left out of the mix. The rule book constitutes the majority of the "legistlation", which makes <i>me</i> the legislative branch. And certainly the GM and players can house rule as necessary, which, if we want to strain the metaphor to its breaking point, could constitute "executive orders" or "local ordinances", i.e., smaller things that the particular group feels are necessary to have a smooth-running society.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72847/#Comment_72847" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-31T07:57:57+00:00" title="May 31, 2007  7:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The presense of a GM can contribute to group cohesiveness -- not quite on the level of being a common enemy, but along those lines.
