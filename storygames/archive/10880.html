As I do, I'm noticing a trend in my writing.  I switch back and forth using "player" and "you" when describing the rules.  Let me give you a sample, this is from Cutthroat:<br/><br/><i><b>The Rat player also has a special responsibility.  After each Raid, the Bikers must brag about what they did.  The Rat chooses the best bragger or braggers (explained later in Advancement) and those characters receive a reward.  It is a very important job and one you should take seriously.  Even though you\u2019ve been kicked around a lot by the other Gang members, the Rat is a very important role to play.</b></i><br/><br/>I switch from third person to second person in that paragraph.  I don't like that, so I want to make it consistent throughout the book.  But there are times when third person seems too formal or distant and other times when second person just isn't specific enough.<br/><br/>So my question is, when reading a game text, what do you prefer?  What are some games that managed the benefits of third and second person well?  Or, at the very least, explained the rules well.<br/><br/>For people who design games, what are the guidelines you use when writing?  Do you use player, you or something else?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241281/#Comment_241281" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T12:38:29+00:00" title="November 10, 2009 12:38PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I prefer the use of "you" as long as it is clear who "you" is.

"The player" would only be used in GM-facing sections, and only after a particular one has already been introduced. Beyond that and a few other basics, I don't have "guidelines," per se; but I do try to enforce a consistency of voice. The key is to establish direct audience (who is likely to read this to USE it, right then and there) and then be careful when shifting between imperative, procedural statements to general, explanatory statements.<br/><br/>You could rewrite it as "You, as the Rat player, also have a special..." and solve that particular paragraph--establish the direct audience ("You, the Rat player,") but then safely go on to third person, in describing what any and all Rat players do (choosing and rewarding). I suspect that is why you shifted person: you were elbow deep in second-person, direct instruction (which is FINE) but then you wanted to be able to make a generalized statement, which drew you to use third person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241310/#Comment_241310" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T14:10:33+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  2:10PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would it make sense to use Rat like a name.

I'm not against it. I just don't understand why it gets so much emphasis on story games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay I'm choosing powers. My character doesn't choose the power, I do. Technically its their power. But they don't exist. I'm the one using it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn film &amp; tv, plenty of directors will speak to an actor by saying "bob, your name is ron" which is shorthand for "bob, your characters name is ron." Although I know a few directors who hate method acting and will refer to characters as a way to keep actor and character separation strong. But in general, either way is fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs a character sheet my character sheet or my character's character sheet? I can understand differentiating between player name and character name since both have names. But players don't have a reflex save, so it seems ok to say, "your reflex save". In play, when I GM, I don't describe a situation and then say, "what does your character do?" I say, "what do you do?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it a clarity issue? An immersion issue?<br/>\n<br/>\nI just looked through my D&amp;D; 4E books and they go back and forth between the 2. They will say "your character's race" and "your character's weapon" but then say "your class", "your ability scores", and "your hit points."   For example:<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/PHB%201%204E%2C%20p14">PHB 1 4E, p14</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">1.

Also don't forget "it," which works quite well in reference to a character of indefinite gender, but not so well with players who presumably at least present a gender. In such instances, I am not afraid to say "he or she" and move on. Another useful convention is to just use "he" or "she" throughout and apologize to the radical feminists or affronted misogynists in the front matter. But no apology for "they" as singular will sooth exacting editors. And, hey, it takes maybe ten minutes to do a selective search and replace on "they" with "he or she," so what's the problem with being correct?

Your character doesn't throw a packet; and you are not casting a spell.

English speakers and -writers have been improvising solutions for as long as, y'know, English. "They" has always been a common solution. Probably the most common overall. It's partly because we also use "they" painlessly as a number-ambiguous pronoun: "at the beginning of the fight, one or more of the players should roll their dice."<br/><br/>In the 19th Century, a bunch of guys decided to establish "he" as the standard acceptable gender-neutral singular pronoun. They thought that it was about time that English had one. Only one, no more improvising, and they thought that "he" should be it. "He," they figured, would be correct far more often than "they" or any other pronoun would be. They were wrong, but they were partly successful anyway, as we see.<br/><br/><i>The Oxford Guide to English Usage</i>, where I looked this up, doesn't hold strictly with those 19th Century guys, and good on it. It considers "they" perfectly acceptable, with as venerable a history and more robust a tradition. It doesn't stop there, though. It goes on to say that correctness schmorrectness, what you need to do as a writer is write good sentences. All of the available solutions are ugly and wrong, because English doesn't have a gender-ambiguous singular pronoun, nothing to be done about that. All you can do is choose the one, case by case, that least fucks up this particular sentence, so suggests the Oxford. "When a pirate is unarmed, reduce his profile to 1," but "every parent should be proud of their child."<br/><br/>I almost never use "they," because I think it's ugly. Maybe twice in the last 5 years. I'll rewrite a paragraph to avoid it. But I'm like the protestant in <i>The Meaning of Life</i>. I could if I wanted to!<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241547/#Comment_241547" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-11T21:30:12+00:00" title="November 11, 2009  9:30PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2009 9:33PM by timonkey.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Singular they has been standard useage English for the last decade...any style manual that says differently needs to be updated.</blockquote>\nThe problem is not whether it is correct or not.  Some people are against the use of a singular 'they' (because they were taught it was wrong), although due to its prevalence in spoken language most people will not notice a singular they until it's pointed out.  Similarly, some people think that 'he' cannot be gender neutral (because 'he' can also be gender specific), and may become offended when they read it.<br/><br/>Tactically, it seems better, between these two choices, to use the singular 'they'.  Those who are against 'they', if they notice it, will only say that you have bad grammar.  Those who are against 'he', when they notice it, will say you are a bad person.<br/><br/>You choose the words to get your point across.  If your reader is distracted by the whole he/she/they debacle, then it will limit their understanding.  See you probably didn't even notice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241567/#Comment_241567" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T02:17:37+00:00" title="November 12, 2009  2:17AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some old grammar guides suggest that important things, such as time, should be referred to as "he", while serene and beautiful things, such as ships, should be referred to as "she".<br/><br/>Which just shows how far the idea of correct grammar gets you.<br/><br/>I am personally against grammar.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AdamK" title="AdamK"><img alt="AdamK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AdamK">AdamK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241573/#Comment_241573" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T04:09:00+00:00" title="November 12, 2009  4:09AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grammatical gender = FAIL.

I've been happily writing sentences like that for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess if you were my editor...I'd have to fire you :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241624/#Comment_241624" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T09:51:57+00:00" title="November 12, 2009  9:51AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OMG!

If the use of "they" will lose you significant sales, then regardless of my personal feelings I would revise accordingly. But will it lose you significant sales?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if it does lose you any sales, is this really the only reason?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have friends and family who are international best selling authors. They don't seem to care and they're best sellers. Their editors also seem neutral. And these are huge publishing companies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with the issue of separation between player and character. If Wizards of the Coast and most of D&amp;D;'s audience doesn't care, then it seems like a non issue to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it's trivial to make changes to side step the issue, and the author is neutral on the subject, then that's also a good solution. No matter what you do, you are going to earn certain people's approval and others' disapproval. If it isn't this, it will be 10 other issues.

This means our house grammar style has to be seamless to both the old-fashioned and new-fangled. We avoid the use of "he or she" by the use of the plural they, and by naming specific people with specific genders, and making sure we have a balance of each gender, not in gender-stereotyped roles. We have also used the "GM is female, players are male" approach. We do distinguish carefully between players and characters, even though I'm well aware gamers don't do this at the table.<br>\n<br>\nSo, when considering grammar, I think "Will this irritate a proportion of our audience. Can I reword it so that it is not clumsy, but does not irritate them?" Jane Austen and Shakespeare used the singular they, but I can't, because, as we've seen, it drives people to paroxysms of fury.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were producing one ProFantasy product, I had to talk down a group of three writers and a female editor who were very insistent on using "he" with the usual weasely disclaimer. It was hard work, but worth it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
