If you have old discussions from other forums, blog posts, pictures, etc., make a thread, put up a link and share the love. A lot of the Story Game threads are already in there (go Ping!) but we may have missed some.<br/><br/>There's also an <a href="feed://www.goplaynw.org/forums/feed.php" rel="nofollow">RSS feed</a> for the forums, so you can keep up with discussions and new topics.<br/><br/><b>Why So Yellow?</b><br/>You may say to yourself: why are my posts bright yellow?<br/><br/>Anyone can join the forums, but we configured it so that posts by users registered for GPNW 2010 look different from those who aren't. That way you'll know if the person you're talking to is even committed to coming.<br/><br/>When you sign up for the forums, we'll check to see if you're registered. If you use the same email to sign up on the forums as you did when you registered for the event, we'll be able to match you up. If we miss you, drop us a line and we'll tag you proper.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269040/#Comment_269040" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T16:41:50+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  4:41PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy cow!
