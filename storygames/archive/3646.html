The problem that I've run up against isn't the actual play - it's codifying the actual play that I witnessed in playtest so it can be replicated.  It worked really well, and I'm trying to figure out how to capture that in the written rules.<br/><br/>In DEAD, there are two phases to the game: Action sequences when the characters are running around the city avoiding or killing zombies, and Interludes where the characters are interacting with one another and playing out inter-personal conflicts.  This phase of the game gains the players rewards for 'healing up' their characters for the next action sequence.<br/><br/>So once the characters enter an Interlude, scenes are constructed by playing cards from their hands - <i>Betrayal</i>, for instance, or <i>Seduction</i>.  If the character succeeds in creating the situation on the card (as judged by the player who is currently the floating 'GM' position who plays the zombies) during the Interlude, they get the reward, if not, then the reward is counted against the total they get.  All of the cards being played are face-down until the end of the Interlude, when the GM assesses them.<br/><br/>In play, this was an extremely organic process - cards were played and the scene played out with some pairs (or more) of characters branching off and doing spotlight scenes.  Other cards (interrupts, basically) were then played either by other players or the GM (face up), to complicate or change scenes.  This flow was very cool, but I'm finding it extremely hard to write down how it happens.  It may have been an artifact of the playtest group, after all - other groups might not get into the groove quite so easily.<br/><br/>So my big question isn't really how to catch lightning in a bottle, but how to explain what the lightning in the bottle looks like, or how to structure the 'official' play of the cards in an Interlude in order to facilitate that flow.<br/><br/>Suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81856/#Comment_81856" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T17:03:38+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  5:03PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Didn't you just do it?<br/><br/>Seriously, explain it in your own words.  Maybe record and transcribe it if you have to.  Then take it apart and turn it into functional bits you can make into a sequential outline.  That's the procedural bit.<br/><br/>For the social artifact bit, maybe you need a sidebar talking directly to the reader - this requires some care because if somebody is reading it, it isn't your game anymore.  <br/><br/>You can communicate a ton about expectations through examples.  Shape your examples to showcase exactly the type of play you want.  Write them around the concept, behavior, or emotion you are trying to convey.  <br/><br/>Is that helpful?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
