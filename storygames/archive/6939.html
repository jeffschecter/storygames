I know it's at least slightly controversial, but I think the story-games codex primer "If You've Played Tabletop RPGs" is not too bad (at least from my point of view) for people that, you know, have played other tabletop RPGs.  But... are there any good textual explanations of story games (or even real basic explanations of rpgs in general) out there on the web?<br/><br/>I'm starting to try to make plans and invite people for my gen con pity party... many of the people i'm inviting are non-gamers and more than likely they'll be asking me about the games I'm planning to play with people.  And, as said, I'm baaaad at explaining things, so it could be cool to be able to point them at something that is better.

We'll figure out which ones during the party depending on what people are in the mood for."<br/><br/>After all, no reason to get people psyched about Monopoly if half the people show up hate games that celebrate the guilded age, and you all end up playing Aquire.  I find saying "roleplaying games" illicts the response "Oh, like D&amp;D".  So story games works if you need to give it a name. "They are like a board game, except instead of playing to win, you play to make a story."<br/><br/>Or you could just say games.  Don't make a big deal of it. The reaction I've gotten from friends lead me to believe that the complexity of RPGs gets played up quite a bit. That's probably true when they were in high school, but not any more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154538/#Comment_154538" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T16:40:17+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  4:40PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Oh, hey, Mike reminded me:<br/>"They're kinda like D&amp;D."<br/><br/>That one's a good one.

Generally, my explanation (of Polaris) is "it's like D&amp;D but a little more poetic and a lot less time consuming."<br/><br/>I find that trying to explain the subtle differences between Polaris and D&amp;D to someone who isn't into the scene is like the asshole hipster who wants to explain to you that he doesn't like emo music, he likes <i>emocore</i> music, which is totally different. There's no faster path to annoying someone than explaining, unsolicited, the tiny details of your hobby..<br/><br/>The only person I wouldn't say "Oh it's like D&amp;D" to is someone who has played an RPG in the last, oh, decade or so, because they would be able to appreciate the differences.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154547/#Comment_154547" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T17:50:41+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  5:50PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Normally I say:<br/><br/>"It's a game where you make up a story together."<br/><br/>But there are variations:<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures: "It's a game where you play out a TV show we all make up together."<br/>Traditional GM games: "One guy handles the plot, everyone else handles their characters, and we bounce back and forth off each other as the story moves along."<br/><br/>I usually put in something about content too, because people LOVE content.<br/><br/>"There's magic and swords and cool shit like the Lord of the Rings movie."<br/>"It's got robots and lasers!"<br/>"Like Blade Runner, in a gloomy ole future."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154550/#Comment_154550" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T18:03:19+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  6:03PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A rough equivalent to this conversation has happened to me three times this year:<br/><br/>Me:  "Saturday?

I work in video games, so this also goes for almost everyone I know casually, too. So, there's a heavy mix of video gamers and board gamers, but light on the roleplayers. But, being gamers who love games, most of them have had experience with D&amp;D, and for most, the reason they don't play is because they were drawn in by the idea of telling stories and playing characters and probably got something very different or had bad associations with those who did play.  They generally don't have a negative opinion of roleplaying at large (they often have fun with CRPGs) they just think D&amp;D=roleplaying. But they're usually open to give it another shot unless they have other priorities.  But that majority isn't overwhelming. There are quite a few who stopped playing because of various life changes, not because they didn't like it.<br/><br/>And then there's some surprises.

Because, generally speaking, rpgs aren't all that much fun to watch, at least, in my experience.  It seems like if it does a good job of showing how to play the game it won't be very exciting, and if the people in are ARE really excited and demonstrating their enthusiasm to the audience, then it will probably be hard to follow the process of the game.<br/>But what the heck do I know?  You shouldn't totally do that.  Cuz it'll be cool and different even if it doesn't work out perfectly.  And it'll probably be better than I expect.  Most things are - I'm a pessimist.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154709/#Comment_154709" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T13:55:51+00:00" title="July  3, 2008  1:55PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian, Perfect plays in a way that could be caught quite well on camera. It's always one-on-one scenes, between a player and a GM. It's quite a focused game. The player will often think about what their crime will be, and then monologue it out, with NPC interruptions. It tends to flow much more consistantly than games with a lot of negotiation.<br/><br/>I'm thinking once you hit the tests, there'd be a lot of stop/start recording, so that you could do some birds-eye-view of what was happening mechanically. So, the first part would be actual play, and then it'd be a stilted, playing-to-the-camera set of mechanical tests. Still actual play, but actual play for a camera rather than fellow gamers.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?
