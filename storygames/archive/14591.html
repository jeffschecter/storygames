So  I started poking around for th physical bits I'd use for something like that ( turns out most of it wouldn't be that hard to find. Took me about an hour of posting on a minis board to come up with a link for free downloadable Stalag terrain, for example).<br/><br/>But, when it comes right down to it, I'm not really a game designer so much as a tinkerer, so I wanted to call Jason out over hereabouts and see what he ( and the rest of you nice folks) could come up with for concepts to take this from a nifty throwaway idea into a multiform style game.<br/><br/>Side note: <i>Multiform</i> as a term is used to describe a game that is a kind of hybridized LARP plus minis game, at least as I understand the term from discussions of Australian gaming tradition. The minis here are used as a sort of generalized inspiration and positional marker on a map or board, but the concept is not to turn the entire event into a tactical battle game (presumably some minis battle stuff will occur. it just isn't the main focus).<br/><br/>Thhe idea has already morphed a bit. As it turns out, The Redball Express started in August of '44, which makes it a bit late for trying to make events center aroound Mid Summer of '44. MidSummer is also St. JOhn's Day, which is a voodoo holiday of great importance. That's just too good a date to pass up, so Jason suggested that perhaps our POWs were captured instead in Italy during/after Operation Avalanche.<br/><br/>Now I like that idea because it not only opens up St John's day as a possibility, but it also gives an excuse to get Tuskegee Airmen in there ( I've already found appropriate minis- The Tuskegee Airmen were flying cover in Italy. No, I don't know why they'd be stuck in a POW camp with infantrymen either. Just run with it).<br/><br/>Here's the idea soup I've got so far:<br/><br/>Game stuff<br/>Meant to be played with around 20 players over the course of 4- 41/2 hours, not including set up/breakdown for any props used or game briefing/character hand out.<br/><br/>I'm also assuming that there will be break times mid-game, probably to introduce new elements or to summarize preious phases of play and update the entire play group on developments/events they should know about collectively. I've seen this work very well for a one-shot LARP I played in and very much like the structure.<br/><br/>Fiction Stuff<br/><br/>The core character group should be the vodun practicioners<br/><br/>Other groups: The Germans, Non Vodun POWs, maybe a film crew (propaganda for sure, possibly involving Leni Reifenstahl), possibly Josephine Baker ( hey, if the Americans can trot out Marlene Dietrich for German POWs, why wouldn't the Germans do the same with Josephine Baker? Plus she served as a Resistance courier, so that makes it even more juicy. Besides... <i>Josephine Baker</i>!).<br/><br/>There needs to be a cemetery close by or in the camp. I mean, c'mon, we gotta get Baron Samedi in there somewhere. Plus digging gear.<br/><br/>Parallel festivities, perhaps inolving the closest town? Or maybe just in the camp? I mean, escape during some kind of performance pops up in a couple WW2 escape films.<br/><br/>Jazz, jazz funerals, jazz fans.<br/><br/>Arrival of Les rois /Loas<br/><br/>Well, that's what I've got as a starter. I'll open the floor to discussion now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332249/#Comment_332249" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T10:17:40+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 10:17AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Model_Stalag_Luft_III.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332259/#Comment_332259" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T10:49:43+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 10:49AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I may have tracked down stuff for the POW minis too. <br/><br/>Tamiya 1:48 US Infantry and US Infantry at Rest plastic sets combined with West Wind Secrets of the Third Reich Forage Cap and Bare Head sets.<br/><br/>I suggest you start thinking about what 20 or so of your pals you can collect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332262/#Comment_332262" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T10:58:59+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 10:58AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://cdn.dipity.com/uploads/events/38ceb877f69a1c0633b8f56f55473d58_1M.png"/><br/><br/>Prada Death Camp,<br/>Tom Sachs,<br/>1998,<br/>cardboard Prada hat box and glue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332272/#Comment_332272" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T11:24:41+00:00" title="June 29, 2011 11:24AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have any idea how you'd do it with 20 people, that is beyond my horizon a little.

The minis are very slightly taller and thinner.<br/><br/>Yes, I am enough of a geek to have checked on that, as well as finding other folks who were doing that sort of Tamiya/West Wind kitbashing.<br/><br/>Kicking Nazi ass? Obviously!!!<br/><br/>POWs/Voodooistes/Jazz/Loas Band vs. Ahnenerbe/Guards/Oompapa Band/Aesir? I'm not sure how anyone could skip that!<br/><br/>B-Movie Pastische Mash Up+ Famous People? Was there another option, ever? God I hope not!<br/><br/>Hmm.<br/><br/>So, howzabout:<br/><br/>It's coming up on midsummer. Even the camp guards are pretty bummed, since they aren't going to get out to celebrate with bonfires, brats, and bier.<br/><br/>The camp kommandant has already ok'ed some kind of prisoner created show long before the arrival of our voodoo prisoners. Obviously, he's never seen The Great Escape or multiple episodes of Hogan's heroes. It should be a nice lark and those other prisoners seem thoroughly sedate. After all, no one has ever successfully escaped his camp.<br/><br/>Naturally, the longer-held prisoners have already begun working on plans for escape during said pre-planned events.<br/><br/>Within the guards/staff there are factions of jazz fans and factions of oompapa fans. Maybe classical music fans or british dance hall ditty fans as well.<br/><br/>The film crew is showing up, trying to make some sort of propaganda film based on Happy Prisoners and/or African American soldiers disgruntled by their treatment by white officers ( look, I already have the film crew minis, so just go with it). Naturally, they'll be schmoozing everyone and anyone. Also, the kommandant and staff secretly or not so secretly want to be film stars.<br/><br/>So, Josephine Baker ( secret contact between the longer held prisoners and the Resistance) is trucked in too. Fawning as appropriate commences. Naturally, JB can't be seen in a German Propaganda film, so that will have to be destroyed or sabotaged. Messages and aid naturally will need to be passed along back and forth. ( yes, I do have a mini ready for this as well).<br/><br/>The ahnenerbe guy is there due to some "psychical emanations" he's been sensing. Also, the camp is close to a quaint old German village with a pagan history, and it's close to St John's Eve, so...hmm, gotta work on that one.<br/><br/>The various loas, as they manifest, start causing behavioral changes in the associated POWs. Also, who will Maman Brigitte ride? The hot secretary from the office who is also a jazz fan? Someone completely weird? Will this cause problems and/or hilarity? Naturally.<br/><br/>Factions within the POWs are scared/disapprove of the voodoistes.<br/><br/>Phase One: Initial meeting of characters and general period of getting into character<br/>Phase Two: Plots and counterplots, open play<br/>Phase Three: Big climactic showdown/firefight/battle of the bands/supernatural fireworsk/escape attempt all with the camera crew running about filming. Perhaps they end up melted as well, per Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>20 people does seem like quite a lot, but people pull that sort of thing off. I'm hoping for vulpinoid's input on that part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355063/#Comment_355063" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-19T22:27:12+00:00" title="January 19, 2012 10:27PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I saw this thread a bit late.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355091/#Comment_355091" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T08:47:41+00:00" title="January 20, 2012  8:47AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty amazing.

Players develop an understanding of how their characters work and how their motivations might play out.<br/><br/>Then throw all the groups together. They'll all have reasons to dislike one another, but each character might find common objectives among individuals from the other factions. That's where the real roleplaying comes in, when players are forced to maker decisions about where their true alliances and motivations lie.<br/><br/>You've basically got the right kind of set up with what I'm already reading.<br/><br/>As for translating the table activities to the live side of things, start with a large room, and partition parts off, with tape on the floor, curtains, rows of chairs...whatever you've got access to. Keep a large area free in the middle of the room for the table where the 3D map is displayed. If you've got four factions of characters, you might want to give four specifically named areas around the room to represent their strongholds (two prisoner barracks, an officer's mess, and the former Kommandant's quarters (where the MPs have set up). Then have four more areas that can be allocated various identities depending on the needs of the story. Perhaps creating signs for "Sports Field", "Main Gate", "Secret Tunnel", "Watchtower 1", "Garage/Workshop", "Armoury", etc. When a bunch of figures congregate on a single area on the map, send the players to one of the ad hoc areas and have them display the appropriate sign. If other players want to get to that area, they have to move their figures across the board before they can enter the ad hoc area and interact with the other characters present.<br/><br/>It's a simple logical mechanism, and for most of the game there will be clusters of players at various part of the map. Players will often be forced to choose where they need to move their figures to engage in the storylines most pertinent to their characters. <br/><br/>Need any more ideas?<br/><br/>Specific questions answered?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355302/#Comment_355302" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T06:28:46+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  6:28AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I'm seeing, both from stuff Michael has said in the past and from my own experiences, is that a game with the same sort of general situation and set of toys, runs very differently depending upon numbers of participants. <br/><br/>The end result of that is that very different approachesto the same general set up matter, and you end up with a very different sort of play experience, even when the characters and set up are the same.<br/><br/>Vulpinoid, a couple of quick questions about the larger sorts of events with a good number of players ( say8-20):<br/><br/>What sort of staff team does the presenter/GMtend to have and of what size? What sorts of duties or roles do the staff team members have? Do folks tend to use a confederate or two, basically staff members meant to play either a key NPC or two, or just generally play multiple bit parts as they come up?<br/><br/>How do the staffers communicate events to one another? Are there scheduled breaks in play, or is everything kind of just a rolling series of events?<br/><br/>Does anyone ever jump in and isolate an area on the table set up when some sort of action scene breaks out? Does someone stay tableside and monitor general character toy movement when players aren't in some of those designated key locations where more face2face LARPish freeformingcharacter interaction is going on?<br/><br/>Also, on an odd note, do these sorts of things always end in a big Showdown? I mean, the tendency and ingredients for that result are all there for exactly that, not just in terms of situation, but also in terms of the one-off nature ofthese event games and, frankly, the presence of a whole lotof action-oriented toys. Have you ever seen one of these style of events that didn't necessarily end in an enormous bash 'em up ( maybe just a little one?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355417/#Comment_355417" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T04:50:02+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  4:50AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll answer a few of the easy questions first.<br/><br/>A good rule of thumb for the GM Team is a primary GM and an auxiliary GM per five players. In a set up like I described, you might have the main GM and a sub GM for each of the factions. When a group gathers in that factions allocated HQ, the auxiliary GM for that faction would be the one who handles things.<br/><br/>In the small games I described as a prelude to the main game, you'd have a traditional GM/player divide. The GM playing the roles of the NPCs and other factions, but once the big game starts, there is no real need for NPCs. There are enough players around that everyone you could want to interact with is actually controlled by another player, and each of those players will have their own motivations to assist or hinder you.<br/><br/>The main GM might stand at the table (or the might delegate a "character movement" auxiliary GM), in most cases the movement across the table would be monitored by other players also moving their figures across the table. All it takes is one player to scream "CHEAT!!" in a situation like this and the other moving players will instantly look into the situation. You could even institute a benefit to players who do pick up on one another's discrepancies in this way. In a war camp situation, this might help to ramp up the tension.<br/><br/>As for some of the trickier questions...NO BREAKS IN PLAY!!! Run it real time.<br/><br/>The aim of a game like this is to create a dynamic ecosystem that self-administers. In general, the GM team isn't there to provide story or entertainment, they are present to help facilitate rulings when grey areas arise.<br/><br/>For communication between GMs, I have a set of six two-way radio headset to communicate messages quickly across the team. But you could just as easily use a whiteboard only accessible to the GMs; this might have a map indicating any hidden traps, buried things or anything else that isn't immediately apparent to the players (if an obviously visible change is made, this should be done to the open map for everyone to see). The whiteboard might also display timeline events defined before the game...eg. At the 2hr mark the allies will drop food at a random part of the camp, between the 1hr and 1hr30 mark, the stars will be right to summon a particular loa spirit....or may define things established by the players during the course of the game...eg. There will be a secret meeting between freemasons among the prisoners and guards at the 2hr45 mark.<br/><br/>These things don't have to end up as a big showdown, but there is an inherent tendency to move that way for exactly the reasons you've just described (one off event, lots of characters with agendas pointed at one another, action toys, a charged situation, etc.) If you write a few characters with specific motivations to prevent things from building up, or prevent showdowns from occurring (it could be great to have a single character in each faction written with an agenda like this, and make this an agenda for an entire faction such as the guards who have the firepower to enforce their agenda).<br/><br/>To prevent unwanted characters getting involved in a scene, characters can be assigned as door guards; and the relevant player literally stand as a barricade at the threshold to the partitioned area. This kind of thing should be explained to the players at the start of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
