The player who gets to frame is the one with the highest roll ignoring color, though they may choose to pass if they like. Come up with a reason why every player's character is in or will arrive into this last scene; and make the stakes high in this last scene. This is at least one and hopefully all of the PC's last-stand-opportunities to fulfill their needs / deal with their objects / cope with the tilt. <br/><br/>How the scene comes out for the players depends on what they rolled - if they rolled low this might be the scene where they get killed or lose everything; if they rolled high this might be the scene where they 'win'.<br/><br/>Then do aftermath as usual.<br/><br/>Couple caveats:<br/>- Don't grind play to a halt looking for the perfect climax.<br/>- DON'T BUILD UP TO A CLIMAX - Don't save cool stuff for later because "that should be in the climax" - if you've got cool ideas, go there, and then try to do something even bigger in the climax, or have the repercussions from that in the climax, when you get there.<br/><br/><br/>[Ok, 5 minutes is up. Coen brothers movies often don't have climaxes (no shoot out at the end of Fargo - just Frances McDormand finding what's his name feeding Steve Buscemi into the woodchipper) so it makes sense that Fiasco doesn't. But I was watching Crazy Stupid Love last night - which is a soft Fiasco (and not a very good movie) - but it had a big old almost Shakespearean comedy-ish climax and I thought, "Fiasco doesn't do that." So, with this, it can. Maybe.

PCs are the players themselves when they had 12. Each player describes their character with three adjectives (in fact make that for every character created) and they start with no powers at all.<br/>Now describe your parents in 3 words and wrote those down on pieces of paper. Exchange parents with the other players at random. Check out what you've got and write another word to describe the kind of relationship your character has with their "new" parents.<br/><br/>Older player starts framing scenes. The first describes the neighbourhood (use the one you grew in) and their routine day when they were 12, as they wake up. Remeber to add the "new" parents into the scene, enlist the help of the person who described them in the first place. Decide if your character feels one of these three: anger, love or fear. Describe how does your character reacts when you feel like that. That's the first power you develope: Example: you feel like you want to dissapear when you are afraid, your first power is that you can vanish in thin air.<br/><br/>Frame scenes later at school and hanging with friends, in both develop a new power, up to three different abilities per person. Of course that powers belong to somebody else.

Let them be influenced by their superiors: the higher in the hierarchy an officer is, the more tainted he should be. But all under the guise of being true believers. Examples of things to say:<br/><i>- When evil kill and maim, we must turn brutal to help good!<br/>- No servant of evil shall live! Kill them all!<br/>- If we kill one good soul to battle evil, the devil is to blame!<br/>- If evil lie and lure to corrupt souls, we shall purge them with faiths fervor, and holy fire!</i><br/><br/>The church is in fact run by a pope who is a servant of evil. His "holy" goal is to give over Gods church and all of humankind to Satan. And God himself will not stop him. The players will have to do that, if they can, and if they are able to keep their faith in the struggle against evil.<br/><br/><i>Have fun!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366577/#Comment_366577" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T12:03:03+00:00" title="March 11, 2012 12:03PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John Carter:  Warlord of <a href="http://tckroleplaying.com/marscolony/" rel="nofollow">Mars Colony</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366595/#Comment_366595" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-11T13:31:04+00:00" title="March 11, 2012  1:31PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Strip D&amp;D<br/>(A hack of Strip Poker and D&amp;D)<br/><br/>Take the number of hit points that you have.

The GM sets scenes and faces you with responsibilities and moral dilemma.  When faced with responsibility, the player must make pulls from the Jenga tower as normal.  If the tower collapses, then the PC has succumbed to a sense of duty or purpose and fallen from slackerdom. Maybe you have rules to try to repent and/or save the souls of your fallen classmates.  And the PCs who have gotten a job can keep playing, trying to tempt the other PCs into joining their life of responsibility.<br/><br/>Dude, will you be the last true slacker from your high school graduating class?<br/><br/>[Shameless inspired by Mr. Teapot]<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367358/#Comment_367358" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T22:12:19+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 10:12PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
