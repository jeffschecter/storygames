Basically, I wanted to do a murder mystery game, but focused on a family that's more interested in discovering dirty secrets than solving the murder.<br/><br/>I could really use some destructive criticism here, along the lines of: Graham, this is fundamentally flawed, because of <i>this thing</i>. And suggestions of how to fix it would be useful, too, of course.\n<blockquote><b>Family tree</b><br/><br/>The first player starts a family tree by writing a name for their character. They add one characteristic for that character: e.g. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Decisive\xe2\u20ac\x9d.<br/><br/>Each other player adds another character to the family tree, indicating a relationship with another character in the tree (child, parent or marriage). They add an opposite of that character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s characteristic as one of their characteristics: \xe2\u20ac\u0153e.g. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Procrastinating\xe2\u20ac\x9d. They also add a new characteristic for their character: e.g. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Bloodthirsty\xe2\u20ac\x9d.<br/><br/>When everyone has a character, pass the sheet around again. Ensure that, for each of their children, parents and spouse, your character has a characteristic that is an opposite of one of that relative\xe2\u20ac\u2122s characteristics.<br/><br/><b>Mystery Cards</b><br/><br/>Take five pairs of Mystery Cards each. There are two sorts of Mystery Cards. First, there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Relationship Cards:<br/><br/><i>Blackmailer / Blackmailed<br/>Fraudster / Fraud Victim<br/>etc</i><br/><br/>And Weapons And Wound Cards:<br/><br/><i>Pistol / Gun Wound<br/>Garotte / Strangle Marks<br/>etc</i><br/><br/>Now take turns, going round the table. On your table, take a pair of Mystery Cards from your hand, give one to another player, and put the other one in front of you. You can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t give Weapons to people: you give them the Wound and  keep the Weapon.<br/><br/>When someone\xe2\u20ac\u2122s been given three Relationships and one Wound, they\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been murdered! Scream!<br/><br/>Once someone\xe2\u20ac\u2122s been murdered, discard any pairs of Mystery Cards that weren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t given to anyone. Also, if you weren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t the victim, discard any Wounds you were given.<br/><br/>Decide where the murder took place, who found the body and so on.<br/><br/>Now, you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re going to investigate the murder. But the point isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t to find out who did it: it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s to frame someone and to uncover dirty secrets along the way.<br/><br/><b>The Victim\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Player</b><br/><br/>If you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re the victim\xe2\u20ac\u2122s player, make a new character, by adding them to the family tree, as above. This character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s purpose is to avenge the victim\xe2\u20ac\u2122s death, by discovering secrets about the others.<br/><br/>Then carry on playing. You\xe2\u20ac\u2122re just like the other players, except, while they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re concerned with their reputation, you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re concerned with the Victim\xe2\u20ac\u2122s reputation. They control their own Mystery Cards and you control the victim\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Mystery Cards.<br/><br/>Also, you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got new characteristics, because you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got a new character.<br/><br/><b>Investigating</b><br/><br/>Again, take turns, going around the table.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can request one of two scenes, which another player (doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t matter who) will frame for you:<br/><br/><i>A Questioning Scene</i><br/><br/>Pick one other player to be in the scene with you.<br/><br/>Play the scene. Describe what you\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll do to make them give up their secret.<br/><br/>Toss a coin. If it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s heads, you may either:<br/><br/>1. Reveal one of their Mystery Cards, by turning it face up.  Together, narrate what form the Mystery takes: \xe2\u20ac\u0153I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve got blackmail notes, telling me to leave the town, otherwise there\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be an accident.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>2. If they have a Relationship Card face-up, demand they tell you who gave it to them. That player must turn the Mystery Card that is the other half of the pair face-up, if it isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t already. Together, narrate how you discover the other partner in the Relationship. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Look how the typeface on the letters is slightly worn on the left-hand side. That matches the typewriter in Davis\xe2\u20ac\u2122 apartment!\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/><br/>3. If they have a Relationship Card face-up, place a token on it. A Relationship Card may have a maximum of two tokens on it. Together, narrate how the Relationship is worse than it seemed before: \xe2\u20ac\u0153The other night, a car drove straight at me. I had to jump out the way. It was them, trying to kill me.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/> <br/><i>A Framing / Blaming Scene</i><br/><br/>You\xe2\u20ac\u2122re attempting to frame or blame someone else. Describe what you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re doing.<br/><br/>Toss a coin twice. If it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s heads both times, you may transfer one of your Mystery Cards to another player. Even if it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s face-up and has tokens on it. Describe how the other person becomes responsible for the Relationship or Murder Weapon.<br/><br/><b>Discovering the Murderer</b><br/><br/>When someone has:<br/><br/>    * A relationship with the victim, that has two tokens on it.<br/>    * A Weapon Card which matches the victim\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Wound Card<br/> <br/>Then they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re the murderer. Or perhaps they\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been successfully framed as the murderer. Same thing.<br/><br/><b>Winning and losing</b><br/><br/>The murderer loses.<br/><br/>The person with the least tokens on Relationship Cards wins.<br/><br/>If there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a tie, there\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a tie. </blockquote>\nAny help is, as always, much appreciated.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75201/#Comment_75201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T15:50:39+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  3:50PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you should talk to Seth Ben-Ezra.

I really, really like the idea of doing a murder mystery game in which you're actually inventing the mystery as you go along.  But I have some specific design concerns with the game as it stands.  Let me take this section by section.<br/><br/><i>Family Tree</i><br/><br/>I love the idea of defining your character by making a relationship map, and choosing opposing traits to the person you're related to.  I assume the first player gets to go back and add an opposing trait at the end?  But why do people only get to make one connection to other characters?  And what's the point of traits?  As far as I can tell, they never come back!  I'd like to see more incentive for people to make connections to multiple characters, but not too many - balancing getting traits against some kind of risk that a relationship puts you at.<br/><br/><i>Mystery Cards</i><br/><br/>I find it extremely weird that you're giving Wound cards to people when they're not actually being injured, and that you can take multiple Wounds without becoming the victim as long as you don't have too many relationships.  It also means that players will start with a variable number of Relationships that doesn't really reflect their game participation, but rather the social dynamic of the table at the beginning.  I almost want to see the relationship cards be narrated as you go, so that you're developing story as you're doing this.  Or what if you take "Play a Relationship card on another player" as another action players can take?  I feel that the secret dealing-out here is, frankly, kind of a sloppy way to deal with the issue of seeding the situation with Relationships and Weapons.<br/><br/><i>The Victim's Player</i><br/><br/>Part of the trope might be for the player to play a detective (think Miss Marple).  Can that be accommodated by the relationship map notion as it stands?  In fact, in general can you have non-blood/non-marriage relationships on the relationship map?  I'd strongly encourage it, and I'd even frame it in terms of "blood," "money," "sex," and other such broad categories.  So a child to a parent would be blood, while spouses might be sex or money, depending.  But it also means you can have the underpaid social secretary, the mistress, etc.<br/><br/><i>Investigating</i><br/><br/>This seems super-gamey to me, with not too much chance for role-playing.  Most of the interesting choices come from deciding whose card you're going to turn or discover or tokenize or move.  For me, I'd enjoy the game more if there were opportunities for card movements to come out of the fiction, not just vice versa.  I like the breakdown of what you can do!  However, how are you going to deal with the rapid incoherence that's sure to ensue?  Are you okay with having a story that makes no sense, possibly even to the players?  How are you going to encourage or support people telling a story that actually coheres - and, more importantly, that they are actually able to recall and follow?  Some of my students designed a similar game (which I'd be happy to send you, if you were interested) and the biggest problem they ran into was that people just couldn't remember the complex plot when it was being narrated relatively quickly.<br/><br/>Also, coin tossing doesn't seem quite appropriate here.  At least let me get another toss if I give a really good story about how things happened!!  Or maybe if I use one of my traits or relationships - this would be a good place for them to come back!<br/><br/>I like your end conditions, and I like the game as a whole.  I feel like this needs to be deepened if it's going to be satisfying - right now it feels like it would be hard to get invested in it on any but the most mechanical of levels.  But I love the concept, and I like a lot of the rules basics you're building on.<br/><br/>Let me know if you have questions - I'd love to talk about this further!<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75732/#Comment_75732" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T14:21:56+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  2:21PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks very much. That's superb.<br/><br/>I think the real problem is the Investigation Scene. Let me get some of the other things out the way first...<br/><br/>Family tree: Yes, more connections needed!<br/>Traits: Not sure! I know games where they have no mechanical impact and I like that. Could go either way.<br/>Mystery Cards: My first draft had a LARPy bit as you established each relationship. Now, it's just constructing a relationship map. Hmm.<br/>Detective: Yes! <br/>Non-family relationships: I don't know, I tend to think family relationships are more intense. But not a <i>massive</i> deal either way.<br/>The coin: Yeah, I know. I've always wanted a game which uses a coin. I'll probably change it to dice.<br/><br/>But the Investigation scene is the real issue, so let me have a go at fixing that.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75750/#Comment_75750" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T15:34:37+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  3:34PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2007 3:37PM by Graham.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with the investigation scene is that there's no reason to play it. You might as well just turn the card.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, games like the Shab al-Hiri Roach handle this by letting the narration affect the die roll which resolves the scene. You can incorporate things in the narration to give you extra dice.<br/><br/>What if we handle investigation scenes like this? You play the scene: the Investigator and the Investigatee. Let's make it explicit that the Investigator must either <i>promise</i> something for revealing the secret or <i>threaten</i> something if the secret isn't revealed.<br/><br/>Then both parties get one die to roll, plus one die if they used a Trait in the scene.<br/><br/>Also, let's have some other dice, which the <i>other</i> players can award, to either the Investigator, Investigatee or neither. Something like:\n<ul>\n<li>A House die, awarded for a particularly nice use of the environment</li>\n<li>A Bile die, awarded for nastiness</li>\n<li>A Tenderness die, awarded for niceness</li>\n<li>An Etiquette die</li>\n</ul>\nBoth sides roll and the highest number wins. Also, we can add a nice little rule that if the Interviewee wins with, say, a double six, the tables are turned, and the Interviewer reveals one of his secrets by mistake.<br/><br/>How's that looking, Jess (or others)? There's a reason to play the scene, now, and I really like that Bile die. And the House die, too. And I like the adversity and the fighting for the extra dice.<br/><br/>There's lots of possible tweaking, of course: I'm still not sure about a die for each Trait and there's <i>lots</i> of optional dice that you could add, but I've probably got too many already. But...basically...I quite like that.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kleenestar" title="kleenestar"><img alt="kleenestar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.replayable.net/pics/kleenestar.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kleenestar">kleenestar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75868/#Comment_75868" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T08:36:40+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  8:36AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's much richer.  It means that there's a reason for me and the other player in a scene to struggle back and forth, narratively.  I also like the structure of 'promise or threat' which is going to give me a place to begin the scene.  <br/><br/>I'd want you to give me a lot of explicit support for the scene being about <i>doing</i> stuff and not just endless conversational confrontations between two characters, because the promise/threat structure is going to dump a lot of people into conversational scenes if they interpret it as "My character promises/threatens yours" as opposed to "Here are some consequences that might happen."  But as a basis for beginning, I REALLY like it.  <br/><br/>It also gives the other players something to do (give the participants dice) while the scene is being played out, which is totally awesome.  What if you want NPCs in the scene?  Are there other roles the observers can take?  How long do you imagine a single scene would take?<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
