I posted <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/111637623248756944610/posts/KrRbrgM1gut" rel="nofollow">here </a>about how my daughter came with me on Saturday, and had a great day playing RPGs for the first time. Thanks to FabReal for helping make this the most amazing Father's Day weekend on record!<br/><br/>I'm really glad I was able to make FabReal this year. Only being there one day did mean I missed out on a lot of hanging out, but I got to chat a bit with Carl, Chris Svara, get a drive-by hug from Jackson(awwwww!) and chat with some new peeps. I'll have to catch up with some connections missed or too brief at GPNW, one hopes!<br/><br/>Session 1 I facilitated GxB, which I really enjoyed. I'll cop to my shame up front: I can't remember the name of the lady playing Momoko, even after asking for it a second time after the game. Boooo. She did a great job: shy, enthusiastic, charming and strong. And in the end, refused to let the cards tell her who Momoko should fall for: Right on!<br/>Hopefully I get the other player names right...<br/>-Marcy guided Takemishi through a flawlessly executed first date, complete with movie, fish &amp; chips in the park and a trip to the planetarium. Bonus points for the scooter ride and selflessly helping Momoko find an after-school club. Takemishi really set the bar very high, ending the date with over half the deck.(But only got three hearts out of it!)<br/>-Jerome stepped up with a manic Risa, who's confidence and quick thinking served her well at the John Mayner concert and sketchy college party. Super props to Momoko for stepping up and challenging Risa's confident facade, and then being there to support her when the shields came down...That was really touching!<br/>-I played Ichigo, and to relate to this tough bad-boy basketball player I did my best to let him have vulnerability and connections outside of school. I was surprised by how much empathy I felt for the guy, I found myself really rooting for him.<br/><br/>Then in the afternoon I played Monsterhearts with my daughter, Jake and Johnstone, with Carl as the MC. I played Zed, a straight up flesh hungering Ghoul, primarily because that is the thing from MH that creeps me out the most. I think I could have engaged more with the creeps stuff, but the game was a blast!  Johnstone's Fey, Anders, was the apex of every romantic triangle in town. But only Jake's Infernal Omar got to first base with him, in an angry double-darkest-self fight/make-out. While Mortal Hanna watched on live-stream video and made excuses for why her boyfriend was macking on Anders while the French teacher's house burned down in the background. Oh, and when Anders came home to find his bed occupied by his mom and Zed, he burned that down too... Man, I so wish we could play follow-up games to that!<br/><br/>Good times, good people, great memories.<br/><img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/>&lt;3 [edit] Got no pictures, though[/edit]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382815/#Comment_382815" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T12:36:04+00:00" title="June 19, 2012 12:36PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2012 12:36PM by J_Walton.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great times were had. I was only there for 3 slots, plus some awesome hangouts, but it was great to see everyone and play in that crazy space.  How did I miss you, Matthew?  Finally met Johnstone for the first time, which was epic and memorable, especially his portrayal of Guildenstern-the-experimental-theatre-director in <i>My Daughter, Queen of France</i> (the true glory of that game shall unfortunately only be fully known by those who participated in it).  On Saturday I ran the only games I'd brought (<i>Metrofinal</i> and <i>The Afterborn</i>) back-to-back, which was exhausting but pretty awesome. Major thanks to the folks who specifically requested them and all the great players!  They both ran pretty great and only need some relatively minor polishing to be declared "done."  My only regret is that I didn't get to play <i>Silver &amp; White</i> in front of that masking tape sculpture of the white city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382819/#Comment_382819" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T13:51:28+00:00" title="June 19, 2012  1:51PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a direct link to my G+ post + photos: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/100566622327534003774/posts/RoocMQbiYMh" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/u/0/100566622327534003774/posts/RoocMQbiYMh</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382820/#Comment_382820" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T14:15:29+00:00" title="June 19, 2012  2:15PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A group of us (me, Mike Sugarbaker, Sev, Harry Lee, Bridget) sat down to hack &amp; then play Shock: Social Science Fiction. I love the concepts behind that game, and some parts of their implementation. But other bits (Protagonist/Antagonist structure, isolated storylines, a demand for conflict, complicated dice) have long been a frustration for me appreciating the game.<br/><br/>What we came up with was awesome. We were exploring the Shocks: raising the dead, and telepaths. We were exploring the Issues: monogamy, and status rituals. Our palette stated that "genderqueer rave culture" was in, that "religious fundamentalism" was in, that "brain-dead zombies" were out, and that "non-consensual mind-reading" was out. We created a total of 10 characters in our initial stable, and it was the ones that were the least interesting to me initially that became my favourites in the end (Sam, Vail, Min Cardiff).<br/><br/>We liked it enough after our Saturday morning game that we immediately agreed to carry it on for the Sunday morning slot - high praise considering the wealth of cool stuff on offer.<br/><br/>More stories forthcoming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marqos" title="marqos"><img alt="marqos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/850/nXOPCJBZCOJ7Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marqos">marqos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382824/#Comment_382824" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T15:00:06+00:00" title="June 19, 2012  3:00PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aha! I have been a-waitin' the birth of this thread for a while now. I considered seizing the narrative initiative my own self, but I'm glad I waited and that someone with some pictures kicked it off.<br/><br/>So, yeah. Fabricated Realities was pretty effin' spectacular, yo. I've been floating on a peace-love-hippie games high pretty much since the close of festivities. I hit my goal of making at least five of eight sessions and I also played with different (awesome) folks at all five tables. Best of all, my horizons can now consider themselves broadened and I grok the hobby much more fully than I did before the weekend.<br/><br/>Here's a quick(ish) rundown:<br/><br/>First was <i>Capes</i> with Brian and David, facilitated by Seth. I am given to understand that this game has a bit of a bad reputation, mostly because of the opacity of the text. Fortunately, Seth was a veteran of many sessions and skillfully guided us past the shoals. The game's structure makes you play "panel-by-panel", as if you were building an actual comic book. In-game, everything worked out just how a superhero comic ought to, with good thwarting evil, the corporate menace halted and the pitiless electromagnetic instantiation packed off to wherever it is fundamental forces reside when not toying with humanity.<br/><br/>Well, things didn't go so great for the President (luckily, there's always a Veep) or the children at the Easter egg hunt (re-animated by magnetically controlling embedded shrapnel) but the heroes did gain the upper hand. Eventually. In retrospect, the four-color fun of a supers game was the perfect way to kick off the con, especially in light of the heavier offerings to come.<br/><br/>Second was <i>Fiasco</i>, with Victoria and Mike, facilitated by me, of all people. On Friday, there seemed to be a lack of game-pitchers, and Fiasco is actually something I'm qualified to run, so what the hell, I threw my hat in the ring. (Plus, I had the unpublished playset that JM offered to us in the other thread. Bonus.)<br/><br/>That game went precisely as you might imagine a trip with three strangers barreling down the highway in a 1973 AMC Matador would go. Paula Deen got shoved headfirst into a deep fat fryer in her own restaurant. An NPC got bludgeoned to death with a 400 troy ounce bar of gold bullion. A nosy cop got shot. Weed was sold to teenagers for gas money. Yeah, a Fiasco, all right.<br/><br/>Fiasco is the one story game I've played a few times, but always within the same smallish circle of friends, and always facilitated by me. So there's been a bit of groupthink. Mike and Victoria shattered that perfectly, and really showed me new ways of playing and thinking about playing. Lovely.<br/><br/>Third game was <i>The House,</i> written and facilitated by Orion and Robert, played by me (T-Rex), Nick (Bruno), Bridget (Jessica) and Sean (Dr. Corn). OK, sweet jeezus, <i>The House.</i> Where to begin? The game's conceit is that the PCs are all uber-narcissistic  schmucks on a reality TV show. Within the game, no one interacts directly, they just talk shit about each other in "interview" segments, where they talk by themselves directly to the camera. Yes, camera. You can't be on reality TV without being on TV, right?<br/><br/>So I could really go on and on here and I'm already TL-DR on the third game. Suffice it to say that the game was awesome, though very, very draining. There's a lot, and I mean a lot, of "bringing it." Pretty much all of the in-character moments are filmed, which creates a unique sort of pressure and sense of being "on the spot". I was afraid that the non-interaction mechanism wouldn't work, but I was totally wrong. It worked just fine and in fact was super cool and very different than other game mechanisms.<br/><br/>As originally conceived, the game is supposed to play out over youtube at a much slower pace between friends in remote locations. As the concept gets more refined, the authors will have to really nail down the differences between remote play and over-the-table play. But there's definitely meat (and fun!) on these bones, and lots of potential for expansion. (We played essentially MTV's "The Real World", but it's easy to envision play modules for many of the other shows, "Survivor", "Amazing Race" and whatnot.) Recommended, especially if you are in an extremely extroverted mood. (A stretch for me, but a healthy one.)<br/><br/>Also, I noticed that the clips from the session are already trickling out onto youtube. I regard them the same way that I did girls when I was about 13 -- fascination, horror, transfixion...<br/><br/>Fourth game was <i>Montsegur,</i> with Joel, Caroline, Wilhelm and Joe, facilitated by Johnzo. After my energy-inhaling afternoon in The House, I wanted something a little more staid in the evening. So something where a beseiged people either convert to a heathen religion or burn at the stake seemed reasonable.<br/><br/>This is really a splendid game and perfect for a con. It's a little overwhelming at first -- all the characters are pre-gens, and there's a built-in web of preexisting relationships. With everybody playing two characters (so 12 in play!) along with the inherent alien-ness of the Cathars, it seemed like a lot to internalize quickly.<br/><br/>It turns out to be not quite so daunting as all that, though. Once play begins, you can sort of focus on your own stuff and not worry too much about the other relationships. And you get them in time, anyway. There's tons of room for intensity here and the milieu (under seige, doomed) definitely fosters a unique play experience. As a tired gamer, I also appreciated that everyone is not in every scene (relationship web again) and you get a little "time off". Also, I learned to take care in lending out your character -- he might come back to you as a child molester. I'd love to play this game once a year. Recommended.<br/><br/>And the finale was the mighty Burning Wheel at a mammoth table of eight players and facilitated by Morgan. The dwarf team was me, Noah, Xander and Johnstone. Team fru-fru, i.e. Elves, was Ben, Julia, Ben and the awesome guy who was the prince. (I cannot remember your name, dammit! So sorry...)<br/><br/>I'd been wanting to ride the Wheel forever, and finally got my chance, with "The Gift". Perhaps the situation wasn't the ideal showcase for the system, but we actually got quite a bit "accomplished" in terms of the mechanics. The biggies were a duel of wits (taken by the rat bastard elves) and a climactic Bloody Versus test that astoundingly led to what will undoubtedly be a lasting peace between the races.

Outstanding people, beautiful environments that sparked the imagination, and so much laughter! My only regret is that no matter how hard I tried to block out this chunk of time, real life got in the way and I wasn't able to make it to all the slots.  I'm craving more.<br/><br/><b>Kagematsu </b>- Playing Kagematsu, I had all the power, and as the strong, silent type, my character didn't lend a lot to the story.  It was a strange place to be and made me reflect on gender roles, and how much I prefer equal partnerships.<br/><br/><b>My Daughter, the Queen of France</b> - This is a brilliantly crafted game! The game mechanic of playing the scenes initially without emotion was incredibly hard, but creates a natural increase of tension. Unfortunately, this fell on a 3-hour time slot and we hadn't quite reached our climax by lunch time.  I want to play this again.<br/><br/>Swear Words / Kaleidoscope (Jackson's double-feature) - In <b>Swear Words</b> you get to make a cliche character for a cheezy sci-fi movie, use them temporarily, and then kill them off so you can start a new ridiculous character.  Goofy fun!<br/><br/><b>Kaleidoscope </b>is a hack of Microscope where you create an incomprehensible foreign film.  Our French film was a buddy action/comedy of a mime and his ventriloquist dummy.  There was a battleship sinking, a 30-min scene of the mime's wife smoking, and multiple cameos by Sir Elton John.  A hilarious good time!<br/><br/>I am looking forward to these become polished games - they're already two of my favorites!<br/><br/><b>Gamma Patrol</b> - Since the only two characters had the exact same cerebral-based traits and we seemed doomed.  Fortunately, my unbelievably lucky dice rolling saved our village from any damage whatsoever (time to buy a lotto ticket?).  I enjoyed the way Seth turned this dice-oriented game into a strong story-telling one by encouraging us to use the dice to tell the events of what just happened. Far-fetched clever plots ensued (why fight when you can convince the monsters to fight each other?).<br/><br/><b>Dreaming Crucible</b> - Together we weaved a creepy children's story of fairies, stones that attack, whispering waves, giant trees that hug, ravenous creatures, and a lesson to not be afraid.  I love the magical imagery that this game encourages.<br/><br/>To all the visitors to Olympia - come back soon.  Really soon.  Really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382837/#Comment_382837" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T18:07:08+00:00" title="June 19, 2012  6:07PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Quiet Year -<br/><br/>I was playing with Pat Kemp and Lukas Myhan. Our post-collapse community was huddled alongside a steep cliff-face, at the edge of the ocean. We'd spent the better part of Summer and Autumn trying to ward off the Taehu, a group of headhunters who were well armed and fierce. I kept pushing for pacifist solutions that didn't expose us to even greater danger and ire. The others kept pushing for violent solutions - poison, raids, all-out war.<br/><br/>I'd started a project to sew up some beautiful gowns (we had an Abundance of textiles), and to dress three of our most beautiful women in them, sending them to the Taehu as peace-brides. We finally had peace and security. And then we found a cache of explosives on the remains of a shipwreck. Lukas starts a project to retrieve the dynamite and build a bomb with it. I take my fifth point of Contempt. Someone starts a project to blow up the Taehu encampment in the dead of night. I take my sixth Contempt.<br/><br/>The Taehu die a fiery death. It's now my turn again. "I'm starting a project," I say. "Three of the elders are aghast at our behavior. They're going to scale the cliffs, and then they're going to jump to their death. A suicide protest." We agree that this project is only going to take a week to complete, meaning that the next time projects get ticked down, it'll happen.<br/><br/>I'm feeling a sting of despair about our community. It's become a place that I personally wouldn't want to live. The elders committing suicide is my way of showing this.<br/><br/>The next week starts with a card draw, as they all do: "Winter elements leave everyone cold, tired, and miserable. <b>Countdown clocks are not reduced this week.</b>" The wind and rain are too much, and the elders feel too embattled. They delay their suicide climb for one more week.<br/><br/>The next week's card: "The Frost Shepherds arrive. <b>The game is over.</b>" The jump never occurs.<br/><br/>I'd finally taken a stand against the war-mongering of my community - finally accepted its failure. I'd committed the lives of these elders. And the cards abruptly cut their actions off. It felt poignant and I'm still all torn up about it. Moving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382838/#Comment_382838" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T18:13:29+00:00" title="June 19, 2012  6:13PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2012 6:15PM by jdfristrom.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Metrofinal </i>and <i>My Daughter</i> were both epic in their own ways.  <i>Until We Sink</i> and <i>Penny</i> took me places I hadn't gone before.  <br/><br/>And everyone was so welcoming and accepting - I feel I belong in the community.

Even though there's a whole bunch of people I didn't get to play any games with, every game I played was an awesome game, they were all totally different, and I had some time for socializing too. I finally got to meet not just Jonathan but Jake Richmond, too!<br/><br/>Pretty much as soon as Daniel and I arrived on Friday Ben Robbins shanghaied us into a game of <b>Kingdom</b>. We played the life and death of a Californian politicized artistic movement, New New Modernism. "Modern life is like being trapped in a burning car. No wait, it's like Harry Houdini trying to escape from a glass case full of water after being punched in the stomach. Google it." I lured Ben's character back to the movement by agreeing that my book about Robert's character's attempt to run for governor would be my last, and then the movement fell apart anyway.<br/><br/>Last slot on both Friday and Saturday I played games with Orion. Friday night we played <b>Dragon Warrior</b>, his game for J-Walt's Stage 01 thing. It totally feels like the story is a video game. I forgot he gave me a copy of it until I got home, probably because I was so tired I was nodding off. The other players were polite enough not to notice (and the game was really easy to play). Saturday night was <b>Slashed to Ribbons</b> (the Ribbon Drive hack, google it) and again I was almost nodding off, but we played in the back room with only candles for light and our horror movie woke me up pretty fast. The haunted house at the amusement park? Yeah, it's actually haunted. Who knew? My character (Steve) was the sole survivor, but he had to give up his tough guy act and stop being likeable. I figure in the sequel, he takes the place of the crazy old guy who warns the kids that they're all going to die.<br/><br/>Because I was so tired in the evenings, I tried to sleep in through the first slot on both Saturday and Sunday, but it wasn't happening. Instead I got up at the same time as everybody else at Jackson's house and played the newly-dubbed <b>Gamma Patrol</b> and <b>My Daughter the Queen of France</b>.<br/><br/>Johnzo talked about a few tweaks here and there for <b>Gamma Patrol</b> (a hack of Pocket Danger Patrol, google it), but it worked great even without them. Rocktopus the Mutant Explorer was captured by the alien spaceship, and had to be saved by the purestrain human in power armour. But then the human got captured and Rocktopus had to return the favour! The mutant platypus developed methadone-like drugs to combat addiction in our village, but they also made him really hyper. The giant praying mantis used her hi-tech helmet to take control of the serpent vikings and they became a bridge for her to arrive at the island of the tentacled supremacists. During the battle, the supremacists captured her and almost turned her into their new captive god, but in the end the village was (barely) saved and all threats were defeated.<br/><br/>In <b>My Daughter</b> we did that thing where we pick names from Shakespeare's plays, so I was Guildenstern to Jamie's Rosencrantz. The dialogue in this game was pretty mindblowing, I don't even.<br/><br/>Middle slot on Saturday I played that <b>Monsterhearts</b> game with Matthew. Before the game I tried to think of what kind of character would be the most fun for this kind of game. After the game I realized I was basically the villain! I did more damage than the Infernal's dark power, but my arch-nemesis, Rose's Mortal, managed to turn everyone against me by the end of the game.<br/><br/>Last slot of the con (before Sea Dracula) was Morgan's <b>Burning Wheel</b> game, The Gift. I've played this scenario twice before actually, about (holy shit I just did the math) seven years ago. This time we had all 8 characters, with the beardiest playing dwarves (and Reid was the elf prince, I think). Even after Julia's stunningly hilarious fake gift made of air, we worked out one of the happiest endings I've ever heard of, with the elves showing the dwarves to a mithril mine and the two princes becoming fast friends.<br/><br/>I remembered like half-way through that my phone can take pictures, and I still didn't take any.

I'd arrived too late for the morning slot, but a group that was playing KiS finished and slapped it down at the table I was relaxing at. We took up the challenge! KiS thrives under these circumstances, and layed in EXACTLY the 45 minutes Mr. Mcdaldno says it does. The game is super easy for players (like myself) who have seen very little of the show, or even not seen it at all! (And I got to fulfill a dream I didn't realize I had: to be Danny DeVito for 45 minutes.) It reliably produces a suitably horrible Always Sunny plot and feel. I want to start reskinning it for other shows! First up: the Tick live action series, and My Little Pony.<br/><br/><b>Trollbabe </b>with Ross, Johnzo, Chris(?) and Noah. It was my first time playing, much less GMing, but it was fun amidst learning moments. Four Trollbabes was a lot, but there were at least six people clamoring for this game when I announced it. They picked three locations between them, and flipping back and forth between them scene-to-scene was pretty jarring for me, like running three Dogs towns at once or something. But it worked out and there was fun stuff in each tale. <i>Greta </i>had a huge wicker basket on her back into which she would stuff troublesome humans, sometimes for hears. <i>Cleo </i>was a scholarly researcher with spectacles and scientific curiosity. <i>Korrak </i>was a proud warrior with a diplomatic touch as well. <i>Cyra </i>was a happy go lucky girl with compassion for human and Troll alike. Most of the stories ended amicably, but Greta ended up bodily possessed by a super-evolved telepathic troll child, intent on an exterminating war against humanity!<br/><br/><b>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0</b> with Harlan and Robert. We were King, and Sei\xf0kona and Knight. Last time I played we had five players, so paring down to three main characters felt a bit odd. We did bring the Princess and Earl into scenes, but it was hard for me to get a feel for how prominently to play their themes, motivation and backstory. We had a solid game, anyway. Passionate (the Knight kept begging the Sei\xf0kona to run away with him and was oblivious to the Earl's true plans. When he learned of the conspiracy, he did everything to stop them), sex-laden (the Sei\xf0kona wasn't shy or secretive; she was like "yeah, I take many lovers, what of it?"), slightly political (Thrall unrest and the formation of a secret police to enforce some severe cultural reforms). In retrospect the ritual phrases could've been used more robustly; a bit more "do it differently" toward the bigenning could've oriented the tone of the game a bit more strongly. But what phrase usage we DID have worked well. Harlan said he'd never played that kind of structured freeform mode before, and he really liked it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383030/#Comment_383030" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T19:20:17+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  7:20PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>Saturday:</i></b><br/><br/><b>Coyote Won't Talk</b> with Jess, Morgan and Harlan. You light candles and don masks and become Fox, Wolf, Dog and Coyote at the end of the world, talking about what people were like as the stars go out. Dog loved people and Wolf hated them, so they mimic people to try to convince Fox, who is neutral. Coyote likes people but isn't allowed to speak, so he just projects people's thoughts with his magic lantern (flashlight). It requires relative darkness and a certain sort of immersion, so we found a back room and sat on the floor. Among the people we remembered were a frustrated man in a dead marriage who met a naive but good-hearted woman in a park, two men leading an exploitative British expedition to North Africa, two women working in a factory during WWII who grew close out of grief and desperation, and a father and son trying to share their dreams but driving each other further apart.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts </b>with Anna(?), Simon and Johnzo; Joe MCing. Fantastic. <i>Levi </i>the Werewolf was too cool for schoole and turning EVERYone on with his rugged jaw, perpetual stubble and tight greaser shirt. He seduced the popular girl away from her older boyfriend (who was ALSO hot for him), and had sex with her in in his old pickup by the side of a country road. <i>Hester </i>the Serpentine saw everyone as prey. He was getting close to the local Cougar on orders from his Family, but took the opportunity to make it with her, as well as his classmate who was along for the ride. <i>Vesta </i>the Angel had been cast out, so he was all about belonging, and meting out judgment. These things didn't always mesh, like when he put a guy in the hopsital at football practice because he'd driven drunk and gotten a buddy killed. Vesta ended up plotting to lead the Selkie folk to storm the gates of Heaven. <i>Nula </i>the Selkie was curious about people, but Hester had her pelt, and though he gave it back, the Ocean showed her that he was a threat that needed to be defeated. But when Vesta joined his song with hers in an unholy chorus, both the Most High and the Lowest Depths were afraid of them, and the Sea itself wounded her. She came to being escorted back to the Deep Kingdom by fellow Seal-folk, struggled free of her skin and swam for the surface. But alas, she was too far down, and drowned.<br/><br/>I've noticed I'm gravitating toward skins (Fae, Ghost, Selkie) that push me toward wispy, passive, etherial characters. I think next time I need to play a Werewolf or a really aggressive Vampire.<br/><br/><b>Montsegur 1244</b> with Caroline, Wilhelm, Joe, Johnzo and Mark. this was a very personal experience for me, because I've played Montsegur exactly one time before, with Johnzo, and I'd played the Captain of Montsegur's Defense, Pierre Roger, who ended up lonely and estranged from his pregnant wife, who seemed to cut him out of all family decisions. This time my Primary character was that wife, Philippa, eldest daughter to the Lord of Montsegur. It was fascinating and moving to see from Philippa's side just how estranged SHE felt as Pierre poured all into the fortress's defense--for her sake, of course!--leaving no energy for affection and closeness with his wife and daughter. There was a scene of connection and reconciliation toward the end, the last time they ever saw one another, that I still cherish. Thank you Johnzo, and everyone else as well.<br/><br/>There was a weird practice that evolved in this game, with people loaning out their Primary Character here and there. I think it happened two times? The results were mixed, I felt. In the case of Wilhelm giving Lord Raimond away so he could play the arriving bishop, it made for a nice scene (Wilhelm clearly had a handle on the Bishop as a noble opponent seeking to avoid bloodshed), but contributed to muting Raimond's fore and prominence in the story, I think. In the case of Mark handing off Bernard, well, as he says above, by the time Caroline was through with him he was a drunken child molester--which made a SUPER strong scene, created an emotional impact that rippled through many characters' stories, and provided a powerful trajectory for Bernard that Marc finished off in style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383031/#Comment_383031" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-21T19:20:50+00:00" title="June 21, 2012  7:20PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2012 7:32PM by Joli.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>Sunday:</i></b><br/><br/><b>In the Belly of the Whale</b> with Shuo, Megan, Jess and Pat. Five disparate travelers in 1641 find themselves on the ship Santa Anna, which is slowllowed by a whale, in whose belly they sit and tell their tales. The constraints of the game took some getting used to but are super tight for driving a rich, focused storytelling experience: everything you say and do is in character (since you're literally narrating your own story), and you pass of narration by introducing another character ("...and that was where I encountered YOU for the first time!"). You also draw random story prompts each turn and incorporate them in your tale while reincorporating other people's. We found that halfway in the reincorporations were becoming difficult and redundant, so we dropped it--we'd already intertwined our stories quite enough at that point.  And I set a bad precedent with a long and rambly opening narration (the game calls for quick 5-minute scenes that move your story along in sweeping strokes), so we were starting to get short on time. But we managed conclusion and satisfying epilogues ending the very minute the slot was over!<br/><br/><b>The Dreaming Crucible</b> with Marcy and Adrienne. Victoria was a withdrawn orphan girl living with her uncle in a Scottish village. He was a hardworking man who drank on the weekends to cpe and one Friday he hit her and sent her to her room. A few days later she was brooding over the sea, when the waves washed up the cliff and swept her away to Faerie, where the Lady of Light sought to protect her from The Great Hunger that resides in wild beasts and in the very stones. Her fear at first made her vulnerable and she sought to conquer it, to tell herself she was unafraid. But she learned that it's OK to be afraid, and you can do what you must despite being terrified. That gave her the strenght she needed to return home and reconcile with her uncle.<br/><br/>This was a wonderfully tender game with a beautiful and hushed mood in the soft and quilty upstairs installation. I was delighted in what my fellow players made together.<br/><br/><b>Sea Dracula</b>, the Hon. Judge Morgan presiding. In the tragic case of the murder of Human Condition Caterpillar, Animal Justice was cruelly thwarted when I, Penicillin Sharpener, with my fellow Good Defense lawyers Spitstain Wallaby &amp; the legendary Bossalot Ocelot lost our case to the Evil Defense consisting of Sic Semper Tetanus, Shampoo Koala &amp; All Hail Our Olympian Octopus Overlords. A travesty, I tell you! A hilariously danced travesty.<br/><br/><b>Superhero</b>, with Jackson, Daniel, Orion, Miranda, and someone else. Plus many more, because as far as I'm concerned anyone present while playing Superhero is also playing Superhero. superhero is a crazy-go-nuts, practically rulese-less make-things-up game for playing when you're all drunk or tired or have a case of the sillies or all three of those. "You have a burned out car and a high-powered rifle. You are Superhero" reads the cover which is also character creation. You take turns being Superhero and have him do stuff, be cool, solve problems, fuck shit up. Each page adds more story things for you to play with when you're ready to spike the punch, like suitcases full of money or Superhero's sidekick cyborg who's just totally a cyborg. We played after hours at the Quality Burrito bar, and it was super satisfying with lots of explosions and close shots of brooding faces and shopping at the Gap and reincorporations and Yakuza Motorcycle Ninjas spiralling in the air around superhero's spiraling car just as the credits rolled and SUPERHERO SMILED JUST FOR US. High fives all around. We finished right at midnight as the joint was closing up.<br/><br/>Absolutely everything was soooooo good! Just playing in that environment at ALL makes extra special magic, and the aesthtic and play culture leans toward more personal, emotionally vulnerable stories.
