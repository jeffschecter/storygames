Sorry about that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But my relationship with him, and our views on RPGs and how they've changed have been a big theme in my recent gaming history.  To recap: he's an old-skool Gamist D&amp;D player from way back and I'm an avant garde long-form improv Narrativist/Simulationist who thought Nobilis was straightforward the first time I read it.  And we fight crime! (well, not really...)<br/><br/>What's been interesting is watching as he's slowly become more and more interested in thematics and I've seen the fun in Stepping Up.<br/><br/>Which brings me to 4E and Trail.<br/><br/>Mike Mearls recently posted a Dragon article entitled "Classic Adventures, 4th Edition Style", where he talks about converting "older, iconic encounters from classic D&amp;D adventures", and he specifically talks a bit about Keep on the Borderlands.<br/><br/>[If you're curious, you can see the article here: <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drfe/20080530a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drfe/20080530a</a>, though I think you need a login.]<br/><br/>"Iconic" exactly describes KotB from my partner's perspective.  He's got some wonderful memories of running through it, most of which probably hinge on D&amp;D being so new and exciting to him at the time.  The Caves of Chaos represented this vast, undiscovered world that he could go out and explore.<br/><br/>Not coming from that background, I don't really share that view.  I first played D&amp;D in high school, running something as part of - believe it or not - a school project.  My gaming background with RPGs was more single-player and computer-based: Wizardry and the early Ultimas, though my first love was Infocom's Interactive-Fiction (and here we see where the seeds of my Narrativist background were planted).<br/><br/>I recently flipped through "Keep" and went "meh".  It's a dungeon crawl.  I'm seeing the fun in those more and more, mind you, but there's nothing about Keep that particularly leaped out at me.  Yeah, the interactions with the Keep inhabitants could be interesting, and the disguised evil priest sounds like fun, but not much beyond that.<br/><br/>Which brings us to nostalgia.<br/><br/>While I've been reading the 4E core books and talking with my partner about his early experiences, I've been remembering some of mine.  Particularly discovering the Chaosium's "Call of Cthuhlhu" in college.<br/><br/>My early experience with CoC seems to closely mirror my partner's with D&amp;D: it was all new and exciting.  That said, most of my actual enjoyment from CoC seemed to derive from the "lonely fun" of reading the books, and coming up with neat ideas and not really running anything.<br/><br/>The one time I did try running something was after I had mail-ordered (dear god, there was a time before Amazon?) a copy of Horror on the Orient Express.  We had exactly one session.  And I don't think we even made it to the "Doom Train".<br/><br/>And yet, I've had HotOE sitting on my shelf ever since then.  It's been joined by a copy of Delta Green.  And I've still yet to run anything using CoC.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151361/#Comment_151361" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T08:23:49+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  8:23AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/><br/>And then I started reading Trail of Cthulhu and responded much as Mearls did 4E: "I can take all those old stories and try running it with a shiny new system!"<br/><br/>And to be honest, it does sound kind of interesting.  I ran a sci-fi campaign with my partner and his brother a while ago that ended up being almost purely investigative mystery: lots of conspiracies and everybody lying and working for someone else towards some goal they didn't understand yet.  And we all had a great time with it.<br/><br/>And so now my mind's turning to pulling down HotOE, reading through it, finding the core clues and the interesting point-spends that could happen, converting the NPCs using the rules in the back and going for it.<br/><br/>I guess the whole upshot of this post (he said, finally getting to the point) is that I'm looking for a reality check.  Flipping through Horror, one quickly realizes that the base is very much...railroady.  You're literally ON RAILS.  It's a bunch of set pieces set in various cities across Europe.  They're *neat* set pieces, mind you, but they're still very much set up in a neat little line.<br/><br/>I hope I'm not going into this blindly.  I've already thought about how I'm going to change things up.  That info-dump with the Prof babbling ON AND ON about the statue and where it's been?  Nope.  I'm planning on just giving the essentials and then going "And he goes on for a while.  We'll flash back to this scene as necessary."  The section where the PCs "have" to be captured by the Brotherhood of Skin?  OK, yeah, if it happens.  Otherwise we'll figure something else out.  The City of Bells sections I've already decided to either completely excise or turn to each of the players and ask them what the other player's character would be dreaming of: what things from their lives would they be facing?<br/><br/>Some other sections are more problamatic.  The other dream city, which contains premonitions of what's to come: how does one run that without it becoming a travellogue I just read to the players?<br/><br/>And will all the above work with a couple of hard-core Gamists who are starting to enjoy other kinds of gaming?<br/><br/>Am I setting myself up for a heartbreaker?  Am I just trying to recapture the nostalgia for something that never really succeeded in the first place?  Or can one truly recapture old wine in new bottles?<br/><br/>I'm curious to hear what you think.<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151363/#Comment_151363" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T08:31:47+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  8:31AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing you might do is get player buy in that, whatever else, they *will* stay on the train and follow the trip.

No secret. The players know that it's a railroad, accept it, and they know exactly everything that happen, from the start. (this is very different from Trail of Cthulhu: no rolls, no points, they know where the clues are because I tell them, and they know already what the clues will contain). And during that railroad, play the relationships between the character, and the effect of the descent in madness and death, with mechanics like PTA o or The Pool, keeping the railroaded "overstory" in the backdrop as a creative limitation, as the master death in MLWM.<br/><br/>As I say, I never tried it, but I think that it could work!  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/khelek" title="khelek"><img alt="khelek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/khelek">khelek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151422/#Comment_151422" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T10:28:46+00:00" title="June 18, 2008 10:28AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a game of ToC last week. and it was railroad central.

That's what drives are for. And believe me, everyone wants the extra Stability.

We're playing in a scenario designed by the GM, and from the after session chat, I can tell you that neither he nor the players felt railroading in any sense. In fact, Trail is the first time in my life I find an investigation game not being railroady.<br/><br/>I believe the disconnect between your experience and ours might be the way you use clues. The game's not about founding the clues, it's about what you do with them and the effect those discoveries have on your characters, so we had very little find a clue, move on moments. The game was more like: find a clue, try to piece clues together, scream in horror, find another clue, find that thing don't make sense form the human perspective, scream again. I don't have any idea how the story might end.<br/><br/>Also, making your own scenarios (or adapting them) in Trail is extremely easy. Not a lot of work by any real extent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151502/#Comment_151502" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-18T14:10:02+00:00" title="June 18, 2008  2:10PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing that helps with Horror on the Orient Express is if you read a lot of period literature set on railroads.

This includes almost every mainstream game. The only difference is that you will never <i>through randomness</i> have nowhere to go. Players can always go in a direction not specified by clues you are given, in fact, in every game I've run this is exactly what happens. GUMSHOE is configured to work with pre-structured environments, but it's not a pre-requisite.  It doesn't have to present a solution to a mystery, merely give you options to continue. Incorporating clever (and unforeseen) player ability use is core to the game we play.  That said, I don't think there is anything wrong with railroading per se; as long as the players are happy to be along for the ride.<br/><br/>GUMSHOE is a GM-strong system as written so if you don't like the idea of a predefined mystery, you should consider InSpectres or other similar games. Incidentally, Steve Dempsey has devised collaborative mystery rules for GUMSHOE, <a href="http://pelgranepress.com/SeePageXX/December2007-Steve.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>The way Graham ran one game was quite structured in the sense that certain scenes were going to happen (for example, all the characters were going to die), but they formed a framework for roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151576/#Comment_151576" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-19T02:12:38+00:00" title="June 19, 2008  2:12AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>The players know that it's a railroad, accept it, and they know exactly everything that happen, from the start.

The players know how each scene starts and ends; they fill in the blanks in between, and since there's no real need for/room for making fancy plots, the game is all about character and atmosphere. Highly immersive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
