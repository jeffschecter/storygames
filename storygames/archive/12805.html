My second time, my friend David's first.<br/><br/>This AP contains a S/Lay w/Me "character sheet," a brief description of the fiction, and some comments on what I like about this design relative to what I most recently enjoy in role-playing.<br/><br/>I decided this time to "say it yourself" for my protagonist and that he'd be inspired by Frazetta's <a href="http://www.museumsyndicate.com/item.php?item=25054" rel="nofollow">Kane on the Golden Sea</a> painting.<br/><br/>I am myself.  I am canny, brutal, experienced.  I laugh at the gods.<br/>I delight in life.  My foes meet death swiftly.  <br/><b>S\xe6hr\xf3kr<br/>"My crew of dragon ship h\xfaskarls, living and dead, follows me to the ends of the earth."<br/>Weathered face. Commanding eyes. Muscular body. Ancestral axe and armor.</b><br/><br/>The opening is common to every S/lay character and the bold text is my contribution.  On any further adventures more details might be added, but as they begin this is the full extent of a S/Lay "character sheet."  <br/><br/>For this first adventure I chose "The breeding pits of the Apostate warriors" as our starting location.  For my goal I decided S\xe6hr\xf3kr wished "to gain the Elixir of the Undying.<br/><br/>Around a pit of blue sand lit with enormous bronze braziers, alcoves of revelers watch whirling dancers.  S\xe6hr\xf3kr sits with his two lieutenants, one living (Runar) and one dead (Larus).  Courtesans seek their approval according to "sacred" protocols of the Apostates but S\xe6hr\xf3kr's attention is drawn by Ghazaaleh, a fire-haired dancer wearing a string of blue stones.  He was told she could lead him to the elixir.  He plans to steal it from this place, and her too if she wishes it.<br/><br/>In the story that follows, Runar is made into a withered husk; the women of the pits are a kind of succubus.  His soul and the souls of hundreds who have come to the Pits over time, form the essence of the fabled elixir.  S\xe6hr\xf3kr is the first to escape the Pits unharmed but is forced to leave behind both the elixir and Larus who sacrifices himself for his chieftain.<br/><br/>S\xe6hr\xf3kr returns to his longship warily.  He knows now the origin of those of his crew who are slain but do not die.  Whether from shame or prohibitive magiks they have never revealed the truth to him; each of them must have done the Apostates some service in life and drank of the Elixir.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I like this game quite a bit.  The story of David's protagonist, Sotak, was reminiscent of Burrough's Barsoom.  We both felt that we want to reacquaint ourselves with the tropes the game is inspired by and then play the game again.  I have large gaps in my S&amp;S fiction reading.  I've read all of Howard, and much of Leiber and Burroughs, for example, but very little of any other big S&amp;S authors and almost nothing in recent years.<br/><br/>This game interests me less for its setting/emulation and more for its design and for features which appeal to my role-playing tastes, tastes I recognize increasingly.  This game is very simple.  I sometimes want something more complicated, but less and less often.  I also want tension and the pleasure of not knowing what will happen next.  This game has both by providing its authors' enormous <i>alternating </i>authority.<br/><br/>I don't need to know S\xe6hr\xf3kr willpower or swordfighting score.  If it's important to me that those are both potent parts of his character I can establish it quickly in the fiction with various narrative cues.  I get to decide at times even how "NPCs" respond to him.  And then I get to turn it over and learn things about S\xe6hr\xf3kr I may not have thought of myself.  Some might not care for that, but I do.<br/><br/>The building dice are a great ongoing cue as to the kind of story that is developing.  When I as S\xe6hr\xf3kr rolled a "1" and then a "2" early on both David and I could start to tell a different kind of story in anticipation of the difficult choices S\xe6hr\xf3kr would have ahead of him.  In this particular story I enjoyed the tension of the overall result of the Match (it came down to 50/50 chance on David's final die roll), as well as the tension of hoping for him to roll a "1" at some point.  I got to be surprised by the result.  It wasn't going well for S\xe6hr\xf3kr but he'd have won the Match and had three additional "good dice" with which to "purchase" desired outcomes if David had rolled a 1. <br/><br/>I have some questions about the Climax portion of the game I'll follow up with later.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289642/#Comment_289642" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T16:48:17+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  4:48PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2011 6:34PM by nemomeme.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *crickets*<br/><br/>The Cultists of The Designer march ever onward as the Players and their Actual Play languish in Dungeons of Apathy.

I think that's just the nature of two-player rpgs. I think alternating the story between two people in S/lay works very well, and is smooth as long as both people have a grasp on how it's supposed to go--that is, what the book says about it. It also helps to talk just a little bit before the game on how loose or tight you want the goes to be, i.e., how much I can say about your character and how much you can say about the world and the other characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_290286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290286/#Comment_290286" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T04:32:30+00:00" title="August 31, 2010  4:32AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans, have you and Matthew played together in other things?

Obviously you're in the spotlight half the time, and for S/Lay you're responsible on your Go for all of the scene description as well as the words, actions and intents of multiple characters.  Thinking of it that way, a two-hour session game might be the mental exercise equivalent of GM'ing for three others for a four-hour session.  And with such a small amount of time devoted to die mechanics, almost of that time is spent speaking (or thinking).<br><br/>Hans and I hadn't played together before.  I think our transitions were relatively smooth given my total inexperience with the game and the ninety-something degree heat.  I think passing a physical artifact back and forth might be a cool silent indicator that your Go was over.  Maybe taking special care to establish eye-contact and having your language be more formal just at the end of your Go would be something to try as well.  I could see different people falling into patterns that work for them.<br/><br/>But none of that is necessary.  Given how few "gamey" aspects there are to distract from the story, a little, "Hmmm, I'm not quite sure where to go from here with Morrow.  It looked like on your Go that you were going somewhere cool with that priest guy and I don't want to step on that.  Okay if you pick it up?" doesn't interrupt the flow much.<br/><br/>One of the nice things about S/Lay is that "I" can hear how "You" would have others respond to the protagonist and can see the situations you might like to put them in, so you can very quickly get a sense for the other's personal tastes, for the present story at least.  You *are* authoring the flavor of some of your own opposition at times.  Reading through the rules, selecting or saying your hero's attributes, their goal, and where you want to start the story are all good cues as well.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_290706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/290706/#Comment_290706" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-31T23:11:59+00:00" title="August 31, 2010 11:11PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey dude, I liked your AP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
