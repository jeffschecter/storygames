                    Heya,<br/>
<br/>
Luke has instituded a new rule for first year buy-ins this year which is fine.  Basically it means that one, maybe two of my Ronny award winning games will not be available for demo and sale at the Con.  It's a hard decision for me, so I'm hoping to elicit some feedback from you guys.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll be releasing four games this year prior to GenCon:<br/>
<br/>
Cutthroat<br/>
Hierarchy<br/>
Standoff!<br/>
The Holmes and Watson Committee<br/>
<br/>
I've narrowed which of the four I'll probably bring to two: Cutthroat and Holmes and Watson.  Cutthroat is way easier to pitch and demo, but Holmes and Watson is a superior game. <br/>
<br/>
So, if you were in my shoes what would you do?  If you were going to be at GenCon, which would you rather me bring?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead of time for the feedback, guys.  I appreciate it :)<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
<br/>

                            How "finished" do you think both those games are? Cutthroat's been around for longer: is it more fully tested than H&amp;W?<br/>
<br/>
My gut feeling would be Cutthroat. It's hard to explain why - if I was at a convention I'd be attracted to both "a game about Sherlock Holmes" and "a game about bikers" - but perhaps because Cutthroat seems more quick and fun.<br/>

                            Depending on the length of each game, Nathan's idea of a collected edition featuring all of them (or maybe both Ronnies winners) is a good one - I'd buy it.<br/><br/>Otherwise, think in terms of which game has the most mass appeal and will be best sold in a 15-minute demo. Most of us Forge folk will buy a copy of these games from you anyway, but Gen Con is your chance to sell to the gamer masses. You need to grab them by the throat with the game's awesomeness in rapid fashion.                        </div>

                            Heya,
<blockquote>Put all four together in a GenCon only "Troy=Awesome" limited edition set, with numbers and autographs and everything.</blockquote>
That's a nice idea, but not practical.  It will have to be one game and one game only.  Which is somewhat disapointing.  I was counting on GenCon more for advertising my game selection than breaking sales records.  Back with Ember Twilight, I remember we got over 900 hits on our website in the three months after GenCon.  We didnt even come close to 900 customers totall all four days at the convention.  If all people think I produce is a small game about Bikers or a riff on Sherlock Holmes, then my company seems kinda limited, IMO.  If they can see I have four games all radically different from each other, then my company will at the very least look like it appeals to a more varied audience.<br/><br/>But anyway, all of your input is helping me make a decision.  If you're going to be at GenCon this year and there is something you want me to bring a copy of just for you, then let me know.  I'll be thrilled to do it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Why don't you produce some kind of flyer to accompany whichever game you choose, detailing your range of games in a snazzy way?  It's marketing that concerns you, right? Josh Barracuda-Razorface is a bit of an expert on that, I think.                        </div>

                            The flyer thing is a great idea, I was thinkng about some sort of foldover business card with the same stuff inside, but I like the flyer better. better would be three pamphlets with setting stuff and scenarios they could play when they bought your game.<br/><br/>One last attempt to skirt the rule, would they let you put out a different game every day?                        </div>

<p>I'm totally behind Luke on his reasoning for the one-game rule.  Which, incidentally, makes it easy for me to answer your question:  Cutthroat is easier to demo and pitch.  Bring Cutthroat.

<code>I don't understand the one game rule but I'm sure there is a good reason for it. Somebody fill me in.</code></p>
<p>Okay, I'll try.</p>
<p>So you're thinking about GenCon, and all the benefits it can bring you.  The benefit of being in the booth, having shelf-space, having your poster up on the walls, all that jazz.</p>
<p>That's dreck.  Yeah, it's good, but it's not the main thing.  It is utterly trivial compared to the main thing.</p>
<p>Here's the main thing:  <em>The other people at the booth</em>.  They're the resource you have at your disposal, more than any other factor.  They are ingenious, moving, talking, engaging advertisements.  They go out and give passers-by an interactive presentation on your product, complete with customized information and presentation.</p>
<p>And you're worried about shelf-space?  Feh.</p>
<p>Your absolute first, second, third and last priority should be making the best possible use of the people at the booth.  You want to give them every reason and opportunity to learn to pitch and demo your product.  Here are the things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have <em>one</em> product ... if I ask you "Okay, how do I sell your game?" and you tell me "Okay, let's start with Roach, then we can talk about how to pitch Drowning and Falling" I am <strong>already</strong> looking for somebody else to help instead.  Because there are folks out there who I can help more efficiently by learning to pitch their one game.  </li>
<li>Show up on wednesday.  I know from experience that if you show up on thursday, people have <em>already gelled</em> around what they're going to do for the rest of the weekend.  That was a crucial, stupid mistake that I made last year.  I'm still kicking myself.  </li>
<li>Pitch other people's games more than your own.  This isn't about being selfless, or persuading people that you're virtuous:  It is a simple matter of leaving people the room to pitch your game for you, and thereby learn to do it.  Again, learn from my mistakes of last year:  I was constantly at the booth, always ready to pitch my own game.  When people wanted to have <em>Capes</em> pitched they would bring customers to me.  The end result?  Very few of the people who attended GenCon learned to pitch or demo <em>Capes</em>.  Gah.  I'm an idjit.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, honest to God, your optimal selfish strategy is to bring one game, and not obsess over it.  Wierd, huh?</p>

                            Thanks, Tony.  I'll ask you what I asked Luke a second ago - what should I do with D&amp;F?  It's a charity project that'll do well when hand sold, it'll be visually beautiful, it's for a good cause, and I set up my production schedule to have it ready for Gen Con.  Because, you know, nobody told me I could only bring one game until yesterday.  Unless they did and I didn't listen.  So I'm down with the one game thing and not complaining, but I need some advice.  <em>For the blind children.</em> </div>

<p>I'm all for blind children (okay, that didn't come out right) but you're asking people to make an exception for you.  You get that, right?</p>
<p>I recommend, hard as it is, that you stop trying to convince people that they <em>owe you</em> (because of the goodness of your cause or because they didn't tell you in advance) or anything like that.  Rather, just say "I'd like to sell two, for the reasons I've already outlined, can I get an exception?"  And then, if the answer is "No" (as I strongly suspect it will be) you can decide which of the games you will be bringing to GenCon.</p>
<p>I think you'd be a fool not to bring Roach.  Everybody and her dog wants to pitch Roach for you.  Talk to Ben Lehman or Timothy Kleinert about what a good thing that is.</p>
<p>But if you're really, really dedicated to the blind children then by all means, leave Roach at home and only bring Drowning and Falling.</p>

<p>I'd love to see some threads where people put up their demo materials online, and walk people through learning to demo.  But in past years most of the work happened at the convention itself.  I suspect that pattern will recur.</p>

<p>Well, after you've talked with Luke <em>et al.</em>, I might suggest having a brief discussion with Jared Sorenson and John Wick.  The Wicked Dead booth isn't under the same rules (EDIT:  At least I don't think so), and they might be keen to support the cause.</p>
<p>But other than that, yeah, charity crack rocks sounds like a good option.</p>

Don't forget that if you print your copies of D&amp;F through Lulu (which I don't think you're doing, but you could just for GenCon), you can sell them out of the Lulu booth. You won't get the same exposure, and there's not room to demo, but you can place it there.<br/>

                            Hmmm. I have a question cause I haven't been following too closely this year:<br/><br/>When they say "only bring one product", what's stopping Brendan (Brennan? I'm sorry, I get confused) with, say, leaving that game on an IPR rack, and you just not run demos of it? Is that kosher?  Probably not.<br/><br/>I'd team up with Clinton for Lulu, or contact Jared/Wick: It's for Blind Children, I think they'd be totally up for pimping it from their booth (but just don't expect a lot of people to put care into running it in the Forge open game area, I think that's where the "asking too much" line gets drawn).<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Edit: Also, Lulu has a Gen-U-Wine Booth this year?  Pimpin!  What's going down there, just going to print out and bring tons of games made through Lulu?  That does sound pretty cool, get folks salivating to publish their own works.<br/><br/>(aside joke: like Empire of Satanis?  &lt;--- Oh, BURRRRRRRRN)                        </div>

                            This will all get sorted - Tony et al are absolutely right; I need to focus on selling my baby (not my actual baby, but the Roach) and make sure D&amp;F gets put out on a table somewhere if I can,  but just relax about it - no active demos, no flacking, just make it available because it is a good cause.  That would be best.  Then sell through via IPR later, or keep up an arrangement with Lulu.                        </div>

As much as I love blind children, we're not interested.<br/>

FWIW, I think it's a shame that the people with proven track records and truly good games at the Forge booth are going to have to fight tooth and claw to get their books seen over the dozens of brand-new crap games.<br/>

                            Thanks, Jared: I was debating whether or not to try to get <i>Decade</i> ready for publication by GenCon, and it sounds like that's not really what I want to be doing.  I'm not interested in fighting tooth and claw with anyone to get my game seen, nor with pissing people off by seeming like a random upstart with some crap game.  And I'm <i>really</i> not interested in pushing myself in somewhere that I'm not appreciated, valued or needed as a new addition to the community.<br/><br/>I mean every word of that with respect and seriousness.  I'm not trying to be snarky, and I really do appreciate the help in making up my mind.  These are things I need to know when I'm making my decisions about how to create and distribute my games, and I'll make my decisions accordingly.  Thank you.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

Granted, things are a little easier nowadays but a large group of Forge members seems to view GenCon as San Francisco in the mid 19th century. You run out with a pick-axe and a pan and start sifting through the mud in an effort to strike it rich (you and ten-thousand like-minded souls)...<br/>
<br/>
...and I don't buy the "I just want to get my game out there." argument from these folks. What they want is to sell lots of books and get the old "pat on the back seal of approval" from Ron, Vincent, Clinton, Luke, et al.                        </div>

                            Except those of us who don't really give a crap about the seal of approval from Ron and whoever. Or who already have it. <br/><br/>Though, I do think that games should be released when they are ready, and not before. But how long it takes to make a game ready is a funny and indistinct thing. I probably would have considered Church and State ready, and it's only been out in .pdf for 2 years now.<br/><br/>So really, is it that you want your game out because it is time, or because it is GenCon?                        </div>

                            Huh.

That's one of the reasons I was hesitant to try to get <i>Decade</i> ready.  I'm not sure I have enough time between now and then to make it a game I'll be really happy with, even though I've been a working, paid game designer for the last four years.  (It mostly hasn't been role-playing stuff, and not all those skills transfer!)<br/><br/>The other reason for my hesitance, of course, is that it's the Forge booth - which, since I'm not a member of the Forge community, is kind of like diving into a swimming pool without looking to see if it's full first.  I have no idea of the social politics going on in and around the Forge, and that's why the window you've opened is so useful to me in making my choice.<br/><br/>I'd be curious, though, as to what you think an appropriate process is, and how you know a game is ready for publication.  Do you think there already needs to be an audience for it?  What about the notion that it's good for our community to have a wide diversity of games available, even if some of them are crap?<br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>(edited for too many semicolons . . . .)                        </div>

<br/>
If you're not part of the Forge community, good luck getting your book noticed. Seriously. Here's how it works:<br/>
<br/>
People sell their own stuff at the expense of your own. The spirit of togetherness flies out the window as soon as money appears.<br/>
<br/>
One or two games at the most will be christened "This year's Dust Devils*" -- Ron is usually the most vocal proponent of the Mighty New Game and others fall in line. Granted the Mighty New Game is often pretty good (MLwM, Dogs, etc.)...anyway, that's the game that is going to sell the most, hands-down.<br/>
<br/>
My prediction: this year, Jason Morningstar buys us all dinner at PF.Chang's because the Roach will fly (no pun intended) off the shelves after the Forge monkeys cram it down the throats of the con attendees (pun intended).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, good for him, it looks like a great read and a great game.<br/>
<br/>
But that leaves everyone else. We'll see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Don't expect people to recognize your genius and hawk your game as if it was their own, that's all I'm a'saying.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* The first Forge booth (2002) was where octaNe and Dust Devils debuted. I did pretty darn well, thanks to TS Luikart's and Jason Blair's efforts. Snyder thrashed my sales (in relative terms)...his game was great and people at the booth loved to tell attendees about it.                        </div>

                            WDBC is partly a result of rebelling against the Forge, I suppose. Lucifer to Ron's Yahweh. Har har...<br/>
<br/>
I suggested to Luke earlier this year (or at the end of last year, I forget) that the Forge was in danger of becoming the Crazy Igor's of small-press games and that it should serve (in the future) as a playspace on the con floor where people can see all these cool little games in short demos. We ended up doing the "one big booth" to afford the Forge that much more space for playing and WDBC the benefit of "lots of small press game-friendly nerds in one place." I have no idea if this will work but I anticipate fair to good sales and much annoyance. <br/>
<br/>
I'll be honest. Part of me is dreading the convention this year.<br/>
<br/>
The money you need to plunk down for a 10x10 booth is ridiculous for most people. For John and me, our corner slot cost a cool grand and some change. That's retarded...GenCon's dealer's hall is essentially a flea market for nerd-ware. But we do what we gotta do. There are avenues for small press authors but even those are really pricey. For some the Forge is a good, cheap alternative (paying $100 for the space means you only need to sell a half-dozen books to break even).<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: I'm not inferring that Ron desires the level of influence he has (he's told me in the past he doesn't dig it all that much) but it is there. And hey, the guy's got chops so there's no reason people shouldn't listen to him.                        </div>

                            I thought it was really interesting how hard some people were trying to push on Jon Walton not to start up a Forge-ternative this year.

                            Well, from being an observant participant for two years at the Forge Booth, here's what I see:<br/><br/>1) Games that came out LAST YEAR at GenCon: Everyone at the Forge Booth pimps them, because they know and have played them. PTA sold "ok" the first year, but the second year they were flying off the shelves. Dogs in the Vineyard sold out at GenCon of a limited print run (was it 50, Vincent? 100? I forget), but no one knew shit about the game. All we knew was it was some kind of "Mormon Gunslinger Game", although people that later got a chance to play it with Vincent were able to sell it better... but again, it wasn't until after GenCon, and the NEXT GenCon, that it was out on everyone else's radar, and sold well.<br/><br/>2) Games that came out THAT YEAR at GenCon, usually published weeks to days before the event: Don't get sold all that well. No one is familiar with them. No one has played them. No one knows much about them other than the tagline and the author's enthusiasm. Some, the "funky" ones (Polaris) rise to the top. Most get kicked into the back seat or ignored altogether. James' Death's Door, Keith's Conspiracy of Shadows (the first year it came out), Fastlane, and a bunch of others were in this camp. <br/><br/>Guesses:  I think that Stranger Things may sell well this year, beucase it's been on people's radar for a while. It is pretty. It has cool, enigmatic characters. It's a blend of cool stuff. And again, people have been aware of it for a while, so even if they haven't played it they know at least a few things about it.<br/><br/>I think The Roach may sell well this year, because it was published in February and NOT Two Weeks Before GenCon. <br/><br/>I think there's a lot to be said about getting your game out when it's time to be released, and not giving a fuck about when GenCon is. By the time the next Con rolls around, your game will have enough press, following, or interest that it will help sell it.  If you aim to publish For GenCon (again, usually a few days or weeks before), it's a big fucking gamble, and unless your game is:<br/><br/>* Very Pretty (TMW)<br/><br/>* Off the Wall (Polaris, F*CK THAT!, etc)<br/><br/>It's not goign to sell well.<br/><br/>Again, this is from someone who didn't release his own game, but tried to plug others' games.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<p><code>Don't expect people to recognize your genius and hawk your game as if it was their own, that's all I'm a'saying.</code></p>
<p>I'm just gonna stick up for the cream of the Forge-hawking crop, and say that while what Jared says is true for the booth as a whole there are, in fact, individual people at the booth who learn as close to every single game as is humanly possible, and who make a conscious (and visible) effort to pitch customers on other people's games before, and often to the exclusion of, their own.  Ben Lehman, Judd Karlman and Joshua Newman leap to mind as examples to follow in this regard.</p>

                            New games in various and how the sold (feel free to correct me)<br/>
Polaris, Dust Devils, and Mountain Witch:  80-some<br/>
MLWM, Under the Bed, Dogs in the VIneyard, Breaking the Ice: 50some<br/>
Nine Worlds, Primetime Adventures: 30some<br/>
Conspiracy of Shadows, Death's Door, Fastlane,  With Great Power...: 20some<br/>
<br/>
Basically, if you have humongoid buzz before the show, you will sell a bunch.  This is: duh.  Humongous buzz does not have to come from Ron (Ron had not read Polaris before the Con) but it doesn't hurt to have Ron loving your game.  This year: Stranger Things, Shab al-Hiri Roach.<br/>
<br/>
If you have no buzz, having someone else love your game and really like it helps.  Last year I sold a ton of Breaking the Ice and Under the Bed, because I think that they are good and important games.  This year I'm psyched about Hierarchy (which will not be demoed, but I plan on selling to every LARPer I get my hands on), Carry, and Shock:  (Pattern -- I am psyched about Joshua's games.)  I have room in my "psyched about" box for a couple of more games, so I think I'm going to wait and see what comes up.  I will probably be pushing Death's Door and Nine Worlds harder this year, too.<br/>
<br/>
If you have no buzz, and no one else has heard about your game, having a cracking good demo and running it constantly will help you, especially running it for booth staff and getting them excited about your game.  Tony did this last year with Capes and did very, very well for himself.<br/>
<br/>
If you have no pre-show buzz, no one else is excited about your game, and your demo is flat, then you will not sell well.<br/>

<br/>
I love oblique insults on the internet. "A lot of other people at the Forge," hey, that includes me! I'm part of the "a lot of other people." Sweet. Now I can take umbrage at your bad fucking attitude and your asine paranoid comment.<br/>
<br/>
No one is trying to stop anyone. Are you actually paying attention to what's happening? We are organizing a booth so first time game publishers can come to GenCon and have booth space for $100 USD. People like you and Jon.<br/>
<br/>
You know how much a crappy, lonely, shoved-in-the-corner booth costs? $1200. Maybe $1000 if you can get the "poor me" discount, but then you are really shoved in the corner. And you know what? You're not going to make back that $1200 hanging out there on your own next to porn baseball cards. You're going to eat your pants, and leave Gencon all bitter because no one understands you.<br/>
<br/>
So Ron, being a fucking genius, built a god damned community on the floor of the con so that we could use our collective energy to <i>help</i> one another. And all I said to Jon was, "Hey, we've done the ground work already. Why don't you join us and check it out, then you can see what it takes to do it yourself."<br/>
<br/>
Stop? Shit, I ain't trying to stop nothing. You cats are free to do whatever the hell you want. I'm trying to help. I busted my god damned fucking ass to make the Forge booth bigger and more organized this year -- so we could have more new companies and more demos at the booth. The booth has been growing year by year. Everything done at the booth is done by volunteers. We make mistakes and we learn from them. We support each other. Sounds terrible, right? Sounds like we are the big bullies of the small-press games circuit, eh? Center of the God Damned Universe, that's us.<br/>
<br/>
Yup, it's a fucking conspiracy to keep the little guy down.<br/>

It may just be me as a Forge insider, or apologist, but this isn't the vibe I got <i>at all</i>.  I also advised Jon not to do a booth this year because he's never even experienced GenCon, much less done a booth there.  I was mostly worried that he would do something financially silly.  Of course it's his money, so he can do that, but he'd have to get some partners in order to make it in under his budget, and those people would also get burned.  I was worried that in his eagerness to do it, he'd make it harder to do next year.<br><br>I, and I perceive everyone else telling Jon to hold off, were not saying "Don't do a booth on your own" but "Don't do this without giving it some serious thought."  Which is, really, what a lot of Forge advice boils down to.  It didn't help that he had his brainstorm about ten days before the absolute last day that GenCon required payment to be received if you wanted a booth.  That didn't leave much time to organize.<br><br>We're talking $1,200 for a booth, which is a lot of money for anyone.<br><br>So I think we had this confluence of "You don't have time to do this right, and you don't have any experience so you really don't know what you're getting into."<br><br>In other news, I've been in contact with Ron (among others) about organizing and getting a great alternative booth for next year's GenCon.  Ron is <i>really excited</i> that this could happen.  Ron would love to see people breaking away from the Forge.<br><br>Speaking of, you want in next year?<br><br/>EDIT: You know what's embarassing?  It took me over nine hours to notice that this wasn't the whisper I intended it to be...  *sigh*  Apologies to everyone involved...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
I'll throw my comments into the ring.  Back in '03 I did have my own $1200 booth at GenCon.  We got the "poor me" discount which brought it under $1k for us, so that was nice.  Being a first time company though, we had no input where our booth ended up.  Guess what.  We lucked out and got situated right next to the Forge Booth.  Not only that there was a huge minis dealer across the isle, a sweet MTG vendor next door and Upper Deck's booth was within spitting distance.  So overall, a really nice spot IMO.<br/>
<br/>
We sold 31 books that year.  At $25 or so each, that's $775.  That's with 3 guys working 'round the clock with someone going out, walking the isles and acting as a stringer to bring people directly to the booth.  We put bookmarks with our corporate name at 5 different booths at that convention to help advertise our name.  In the end, we still didn't break even.  If we hadn't had the Entrepreneurial Discount, the loss would have been worse.<br/>
<br/>
So I warned Jon about it.  I warn everyone about it.  When I look at $100 vs $1200 I know I'm getting a deal.  I don't mind the restriction or the confusion because I know how bad it could be if I did it alone.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            Here's where I stand at this point:<br/><br/>So Ron &amp; Co. created the Forge Booth several years back, making a great space for indie games at GenCon that didn't exist before, at least not in a significant way or in a way where the economics really made sense.  Before then, I imagine most indie games companies had experiences much like what Tony describes, and this includes the guys selling the pornographic baseball cards.<br/><br/>However, because the Forge Booth worked so well and because Ron &amp; Co. opened the booth up to any indie creators who wanted to participate, it's gotten bigger every year (and will continue to get bigger) and managing a bigger booth means more work and better coordination.  And this means clear guidelines for people who want to participate in the booth and getting someone with an intense passion to make this work (and Luke is definitely the right guy for the job) working to herd everyone in the right direction.<br/><br/>However, you have a bunch of things clashing here:<br/><br/>- what's best for the booth, to make it function better and be profitable<br/>- what's best for indie roleplaying as a community<br/>- what's best for individual creators, allowing them the freedom to do what they think's best for their games<br/><br/>These, of course, are closely interconnected.  If individual creators are successful, that's good for the community.  If the Forge Booth is successful, that's good for the community.  And the Forge Booth has been a great resource and gathering point for individual creators.  Still, these are not really the same thing.<br/><br/>Luke, I don't think you should be surprised that the independent spirit that leads people to publish their own games makes some people bristle at the idea of giving up some of their freedom to work the Forge Booth.  You're a "middle finger to the Man" guy.  The Forge Booth is more grassroots organizing than the Man, of course.  But as any small organization gets larger, there are growing pains, and people have to decide if they're not better off striking out on their own, especially if they don't feel like the larger organization shares the concerns that are most important to them.  There are two ways to make your concerns central: join the Forge Booth and push for them, or start a seperate group with those concerns taken into consideration from the beginning.<br/><br/>Personally, while I'm totally supportive of the Forge Booth and whatever policies you have to implement there to get it to work, I tend to think the only long-term solution to the problem of growth (which is ultimately about having too many games at the booth , such that there's no display space or people working there are only familiar with half the games) is to set up a bunch of seperate booths with a handful of creators at each one that work hard to really understand, pitch, and demo each other's games.  I think Luke and Ben's concerns that they'll spread us all over GenCon, hidden among crappy booth selling crappy games, is one that we can definitely overcome.  That's not good for GenCon or us.  Most significant comic conventions now have seperate sections for indie creators, and I think that's something we could definitely organize and push for at GenCon.<br/><br/>Here's a quote from HeroesCon in Charlotte:
<ul><br/>In an effort to promote the best guest list possible, we've created Indie Island, a well over 5000 square foot section at the very center of our Artists Alley, plus tons of booths and tables spreading out to both walls of the convention hall--filled with the leading lights of the comics industry's indie &amp; small press, both creators and publishers! Our first ever Indie Island, in 2005, was a great big fat hit, so we're pulling out all the stops in 2006--not only are we looking to double the guest list, but we're improving the layout and expanding our Indie Island-themed panels and special events.</ul>
So I guess I'm trying to consider the larger picture, which includes not just the rapid expansion of the Forge Booth, but other possible alternatives too.  But yeah, all that's on the burner for next year, though.<br/><br/>And Jess, I'm sorry if you don't feel like you can join the Forge Booth.  It would be badass to have you there.  Despite Luke's aggressive tone, he really wants you there too.  It may not be an ideal community (as you can see from Jared's comments, which have some truth in them, while obviously being biased), but it does a great job of helping people promote and sell their games, as well as inroducing you to a lot of smart people who have a lot of experience doing this type of thing.<br/><br/>Yes, the idealist in me is interested in more than that.  I want to change the fucking world.  And I don't especially care if I have to spend a nice chunk of my own money to do it.  But it would suck to spend a nice chunk of cash and have no one care or notice.  That would be soul killing.  So yeah, it's gonna take at least another year to do this right.  And, for me, that means learning as much as I can from the Forge Booth this year.                        </div>

<p>Y'know what would be <em>really</em> good for the Indie Community?  Social Darwinism.  A nice, hard shake-out.  A mass extinction.  Not that I don't love each and every indie game producer like a member of my own family, but some of them have way more hot air than business sense.</p>
<p>So yeah, I really, <em>really</em> hope that in the next few years folks will have a diaspora away from the tested, managed, sustainable model of the Forge Booth.  If we had, like, ten Indie Booths then we could pretty well guarantee that eight of them would be built on wishes and moxie rather than sound business practice, and when they went down in flames they'd leave a smaller, better pool behind for next year.  That'd be cool.</p>

                            Luke, <br/><br/><code>Yup, it's a fucking conspiracy to keep the little guy down. </code><br/><br/>Love you to death man, and I actually agree with you about the bussiness sense and community of it, but posts like this are one of the reasons why people who should be at the Forge booth really don't want to be. <br/><br/>Which is unfortunate. The way that you dealt with Mo in email was wonderful, and you made her feel excited and welcomed at the booth. I was really, really impressed with you and Ron and Ben and your energy and enthusiasm around this. I know what you actuall attitude about the issue is, and I know that it is a good, community oriented thing that you are busting your balls to make happen. <br/><br/>But the above post? Poor form, man. Really damn poor form. It does the opposite of what you want it to do. Even I, who is semi in love with the Forge booth, read it and say "Jebus, dude, why the fuck would I want to talk to you if you're going to spray venom like that." <br/><br/>All I can say at this point is what I say to a lot of my friends who get pissed when they read Anyway or the Forge and get an attitude of they are attacking me: The attack you are responding to isn't an attack, and the target you feel is on your back isn't even near you. <br/><br/>Seriously folks, all of us, if we want to build the Forge booth as a community -- even a community spread across multiple booths -- we need to talk to each other better. Comments like "I don't get it. Do that, and plan on losing my respect and others' respect in the process. If you don't care about that, have a nice ride. (shrug)" do not help. <br/><br/>At all. <br/><br/>Comments like: "So I warned Jon about it. I warn everyone about it. When I look at $100 vs $1200 I know I'm getting a deal. I don't mind the restriction or the confusion because I know how bad it could be if I did it alone" do. <br/><br/>A lot.<br/><br/>So trust me, I can understand where everyone feels frustrated, and where everyone can feel under attack. But lashing out isn't going to make it better, it's only gonna drive the wedge deeper.                        </div>

                            Wow ... uh, I really didn't mean to come across as rude.  Luke, I'm sorry if you felt that I was picking on you.  All the information I had to go on was what I saw in the blogosphere, and I didn't have the social context to know what was really going on.  Reading some of the comments about this whole thing - well, for someone who doesn't know the people behind them, they had this weirdly hostile tone.  I'm glad to understand that what I was really hearing is frustration with how damn hard it is to put together one of these booths and make it work.<br/><br/>That's why, as Brand pointed out, it's fantastically helpful for people to talk about some of the other things that have gone into this whole discussion - a behind the scenes look, so to speak.  Troy, Jon, Brand, Ben, Tony, thanks for your input and advice.  I do love my game(s!) and I want to make sure that they, and I, are ready.<br/><br/>Thomas, Jon, et. al., I love the idea of an alternative booth for next year.  I've got organize-fu like you wouldn't believe - and it sounds like a lot of the people who are involved in this discussion (and some who aren't, like Ron) could give us a lot of advice about what we should do and what we should be careful about.  This is probably the beginning of a much longer conversation.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<code>...some of them have way more hot air than business sense.</code><br/><br/>While we're calling people out for making vague insults on the internet, I'd appreciate it if you explained this comment, Tony.  If you want to rail against people's business sense, at least show enough respect to name them and explain your reasoning.  Otherwise you're just blowing hot air.<br/><br/><b>Jess:</b> Yes.

                            Luke: Please temper attacks a little bit more, thanks.<br/><br/>Brand:<br/><i><b>But the above post? Poor form, man. Really damn poor form. It does the opposite of what you want it to do. </b></i><br/><br/>I agree, but without Luke busting his ass, losing sleep and food and tons of money in the process to make sure that everything goes right, the Forge booth would have exploded and died, scattered to the winds. Please see how it's hard to say, <b>"Hey, that stuff that you did for the past three years of your life, for a solid week of man-hours each year, where you said it was for the good of the community? It was a deception. Lies."</b> ...even if it's based on what was heard on the internet, still uttering something like that... it's gonna hurt someone.<br/><br/>So: Slap in the face, rebuttal slap.  Now that that's out of the way, hopefully everyone can be cool about stuff and move forward.<br/><br/>After all, as I like to point out, me and Clinton's first words exchanged on the internet were something like "Fuck you, asshole".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            We are cool.<br/>
<br/>
To everyone: Note well, the internet sucks. What Ron has done has changed this. Instead of being a community of faceless screen names, we are a community of friends, partners and associates. This face-to-face association and support is what has truly allowed the Forge to grow and prosper. So unless you have personally been involved in the event organizing -- at Dexcon, Forgecon or Gencon -- bite thy tongue.<br/>
<br/>
This is the most giving, open and progressive community I have ever had the honor to be a part of. Think before you disparage it with careless commentary. You know not of what you speak.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am not looking for some martyr award: "Oh, look at how hard he works! Poor him!" I'm actively and forcely trying to make this community more suited to its growing membership every year. Just like Andy K., Clinton, Ron and the Game Chef guys.<br/>
<br/>
I utterly refuse to see this community factionalize and form cliques. If I see cliques form in person (they've already formed on the intarweb, it's disgusting), I will drag you by the hair back into the drum circle. We are all of one mind and one purpose -- despite our different methods and ideas. Say it with me: We are of one mind and one purpose. I don't care about your politics, your attitude or your game -- so long as you are dedicated to improving the art of game design via small press game publishing. Accept each other's differences. Now. They are for the good.<br/>
<br/>
Like it or not, you are all my friends and allies. You can walk away from that, but that's your choice. And I can tell you right now, <b>I won't like it.</b><br/>

<p>Jebus fuck, Luke said it before I did.</p>
<p>Here's the alternative:</p>
<p>Get enough people together so that you can afford a booth, make a banner, coordinate sales, and get yourselves noticed as a community so people are excited to see your booth.</p>
<p>I'm totally serious when I say that that would be <em>awesome</em>. To have GenCon become groups of artistic schools of game design? Holy shit, that would be hot.</p>
<p>I'm stickin' with the Forge because they're my people. They've done me right and I like to do right by them. They're my friends, my colleagues, and I learn from them. If everyone had groups like that, it would be great. If the Forge doesn't suit your needs, go to it! Make it happen!</p>

                            Luke, you are teh awesome. <br>
<br>
I say this as a relative newcomer to this whole scene, but one who has a game out, and has been going to Cons and getting my game out there: its f'ing HARD. Seriously, meeting people like Tony &amp; Luke &amp; Clinton &amp; Michael &amp; Jared and all the other folks, and seeing their energy and enthusiam - it's easy to be all "those guys are special, I'm just this shmoe." But they want to help you! (well, maybe not Jared...) <br>
<br>
[ranty]Something that I think I'm just coming around to recently is that, y'know what, you have to make an effort to LEARN from these guys and gals. But it won't "just happen." If we want this community to grow and gain strength, we all need to expend the effort to learn from whats gone before, as well as to innovate and continue pushing outwards. It's an active process. Me personally? I'm fucking lazy and passive in general, and I have to work hard to push past that and be an active member of the community. If I don't, I'm just a leech, and that's not good for me or anyone else. Publishing is a commitment, and maintaining that committment takes a good amount of time, energy and money that, in all honesty, I could be putting to more profitable use somewhere else. But I don't, because I love my games and I love this scene, and I want both to be the best they can be. Which means listening and learning and swallowing some pride, sometimes.[/ranty]<br>
