                    I saw the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268126/" rel="nofollow">Adaptation</a> for the first time a couple of days ago and took away this dilemma:<br/><br/>you can't tell an interesting story about ordinary life ('about flowers' is how they put it in the film); but you can't tell a story with the structured elements we expect from most media without the story being formulaic and stupid. <br/><br/>this worried me for a few minutes. <br/><br/>I was wondering if it has any relevence in the rpg context. It seems like people have enjoyed relatively unstructured role-playing experiences for a long time &amp; that people are enjoying games with built in conflicts &amp; aggressive scene framing, so maybe something about the improvisational nature of role-playing makes it immune to these razor-edged perils.<br/><br/>ps- opposing quotes from the movie:<br/><br/>"I don't want to cram in sex or guns or car chases or characters learning profound life lessons or growing or coming to like each other or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. The book isn't like that, and life isn't like that, it just isn't. I feel very strongly about this."<br/><br/>"Nothing happens in the world? Are you out of your fucking mind? People are murdered every day. There's genocide, war, corruption. Every fucking day, somewhere in the world, somebody sacrifices his life to save someone else. Every fucking day, someone, somewhere makes a conscious decision to destroy someone else. People find love, people lose it. For Christ's sake, a child watches her mother beaten to death on the steps of a church. Someone goes hungry. Somebody else betrays his best friend for a woman. If you can't find that stuff in life, then you, my friend, don't know crap about life. And why the FUCK are you wasting my two precious hours with your movie? I don't have any use for it. I don't have any bloody use for it."                </div>

I'd say that you can't tell a story with the structured elements we expect <em>using them in the ways we expect them to be used</em> without the story being formulaic and stupid.  Which is why I find roleplaying more refreshing than stultifying half of the time: we are all massively enculturated to know these elements and where they go in a structure, and we can use those elements to communicate with each other.  However, the way we use those elements is up to us, and we can subvert, invert, or exagerrate any of them at will.  Once you start doing that, the resulting story will be anything but formulaic.<br/><br/>For example: in the terrible, terrible movie Darkman, there's one beautiful moment.  Darkman is facing down the badguy at the end of the movie.  He's holding him by his throat off of the steel girders of an under-construction building.  "You can't drop me," the badguy says, "if you kill me, you'll be no better than I am!"  And Darkman pauses for a moment, nods, says, "You're right" -- and drops him.  Roleplaying is opportunity after opportunity for everybody at the table to do just exactly that.                        </div>

There's a concept in contact juggling.  I don't know if it has a name, but I've noticed it in swing dancing, kendo and story telling.  I guess it's basically just polishing.  Let me see if I can explain myself by way of example.<br/><br/>When you learn a new juggling trick, it has a series of steps.  You start off doing each step separately, and blending them just enough that you get from the beginning of the trick to the end.  If you keep doing it that way, though, the trick looks ugly and ungraceful.  The next thing to do is to smooth the steps together until the entire trick is one continuous motion, and the steps disappear.  <br/><br/>In regards to using structural elements of a story (like acts and scenes, foreshadowing, symmetries, themes, etc) they're like the steps.  A well told story will usually have all of those things, but by themselves they're ugly.  There's a significant part to the craft of telling a story that glides between those parts to smooth them together in a continuous whole.<br/><br/>I'm often surprised by movies or books that I really enjoy, because they'll incorporate elements I might otherwise think of as hackneyed.  And they're enjoyable precisely and especially because they've put a hackneyed piece of storytelling to good use, and made it part of the whole.<br/><br/>Now, as to <cite>Adaptation,</cite> I found myself struggling to keep interest about at the beginning of the third act.                        </div>

<i>Adaptation</i> is one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>While the <i>Adaptation</i> dilemma is a huge problem for conventional story-tellers in a world of jaded story-consumers, I don't think that the difficulty applies directly to the play of RPGs, because in RPGs, the story-consumers are de facto the story-creators as well, and you're inherently interested in your own story-telling no matter how formulaic it is.<br/><br/>I do think that the <i>Adaptation</i> dilemma explains part of why it's rarely interesting to hear or read, in detail, about someone else's RPG game experience, though.                        </div>

The really interesting thing about that â€” and I agree, it's where the film gets weaker â€” is that at about the beginning of the third act Kaufman transitions, and <i>actually begins</i> to "cram in sex [and] guns [and] car chases [and] characters learning profound life lessons...." (Which was probably inevitable from the point that he declared that he'd really rather not, but there you have it.)                        </div>

                            Everyone says that playing an RPG is like writing a novel or producing a radio play or what-have-you. I've always maintained that the closest analog to playing a roleplaying game is dreaming. In this case, there are other individuals in on the dream. But to try and convey that experience is impossible. You can talk about what happened but you'll never convey the experience. And like in dreams, the actual details are often boring / nonsensical / etc. to listeners in a "you had to be there" kind of way.                        </div>

                            (cross posted with several other folks)<br/><br/>Right on, Judson. Great point.<br/><br/>Jeff wrote:

I agree. The issue I saw that Charlie Kaufman was raising was not so much the structure of a story (situation introduction, rising action, resolution/climax, falling action) or elements of storytelling (scenes, foreshadowing etc.) because when we tell stories about real life that is exactly how we make them interesting, regardless of whether they are about missing the bus or about a massacre in World War II.  In structured games, we just make it more reliably the case that people hit these points, whereas in less formally structured games it's more left up to the skill of the individual playgroup as to whether you get that stuff.  <br/><br/>Instead, what I thought he was dealing with was the laser-sharking of life--which is exactly what he did in the film by introducing the drug smuggling (am I recalling right?) and romance plotlines that wind up the film.  They just didn't fit with the rest of the plot, but they made it a "movie" plotline.  The film is much weaker because of them, but on the other hand, the fact that they are weak shows that the criticisms he voices through the character of Charlie are right. They illustrate his point. Another way to see the "nothing happens in the world" quote is to realize that you can use the narrative material of real life, you don't have to go beyond it to find real conflict. <br/><br/>In rpgs, some games use this kind of lasersharking to a fabulous degree.  The Shab Al-hiri Roach comes to mind. Having the horrible things people do be forced by a mind controlling roach gives enough distance for the players to lace into what they really do not admire in academe. Safely.  The supernatural in Dogs functions similarly. However, these games and others are beginning to come around to my reading of the "nothing happens in the world?" viewpoint--they tap into the real world for their material.                        </div>

I was assuming that role playing is different enough, as a number of folks have underscored, that this conundrum need not apply directly. I think folks have spoken well to that point.<br/><br/>but to play devil's advocate don't some strong currents in role-playing theory and design (that might lazily be summarized as forge narrativism/story now) call for front loading in themes of the 'characters learning life lessons' sort. And that this focus could often improve enjoyment of the story-like elements that emerge from play - and simutaneously channel games in a way that weakens some of the dreamlike/ being-there distinct pleasures of role-playing.                        </div>

Emily (&amp; Judson &amp; Judson, who hit the same point)<br/><br/>structure was probably a bad choice of words. I think laser-sharking captures half of it (the car chases, drugs, gunfights etc) but the other half is similar to a lot of cool stuff that games are using (agressive scene framing; relationship maps; pre-loaded character motivations and conflicts). <br/><br/>It's good stuff... but if you're a member of the fringe rpg school of quotidian, phenomenological, dialectical-optical, simulationism like me then there can be a down side that accompanies the benefits.                        </div>

The book isn't like that, and life isn't like that, it just isn't. I feel very strongly about this."</span><br/><br/>Y'know, both novels and quirky New Yorker-esque journalism like The Orchid Thief have the same value proposition for the reader: you'll learn something about life. Orlean makes all kinds of value statements about life and humanity throughout the text of the book. Both novels and nonfiction like The Orchid Thief help us understand the world, and ourselves. The meaning of life is figuring out <em>the rules</em>. I don't see any reason you can't have a "slice of life" game without sex, guns, life lessons, and personal growth for the characters, as long as the players have a structure for interpreting the in game events. An excellent example is confessionals in InSpectres. Players take a break from the game and interpret events, and the interpretations then have mechanical weight. So have a slice of life game that's interrupted with player assertions about the way the world works, with subsequent play affected by those assertions. "Yes, he won...the whole damn pot. But it was a bluff. He's a risky bastard and one day it's going to get him killed." Or, "It was a bluff, and I won't be taken with the same trick twice." The reason Ron calls narrativism "story now" is to differentiate it from "story in retrospect" (or "meaning in retrospect"). The Orchid Thief, from Susan Orlean's perspective, is "meaning in retrospect." But with the right rule structure I can't see how it's not as engaging as narrativism.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>

                            In screenwriting, story structure is there so the writer doesn't have to worry about it, he can focus on content instead.<br/><br/><i>Adaptation</i> is a critisim against the unoriginal content of Hollywood movies. I don't think Kaufman's critisim really is that movies should be more like real life, even though his character in the movie says so. That's just another case of him playing with screenwriting conventions ("the main character must clearly state his motivation").<br/>Instead, the movie critisizes the cliched elements in the story itself: The fact that every action movie has to have a chase, often with the main character on horseback, every movie about a schyzofrenic character has at least one mirror in it, and everyone walking through the swamp meets a crocodile. The tortured writer that wants to write a story "like real life" is just as much an overused cliche.<br/><br/>I agree with most people here about the third act of the movie. Although the fact that the movie actually gets weaker as soon as the cliche elements are introduced somehow shows Kaufman's point, it feels a bit like a joke that goes on for half an hour after the punchline. However, I think that's as much the director's fault as it is Kaufman's. Spike Jonze isn't really an action director.

I believe the movie is intended to be unreliable right from the start. That's why it begins on the set of <i>Being John Malkovich</i>, with all those people wearing Malkovich-masks. Now, I don't know if you've seen that movie, but that scene wasn't filmed with people wearing masks, it was a computer effect. So <i>Adaptation</i> is lying to us from the very first shot, and I think the audience is intended to pick that up and question everything that happens right from the start.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeff Tidball</cite><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Now, as to<i>Adaptation</i>, I found myself struggling to keep interest about at the beginning of the third act.</blockquote>
The really interesting thing about that â€” and I agree, it's where the film gets weaker â€” is that at about the beginning of the third act Kaufman transitions, and<i>actually begins</i>to "cram in sex [and] guns [and] car chases [and] characters learning profound life lessons...." (Which was probably inevitable from the point that he declared that he'd really rather not, but there you have it.)<br/>See, the funny thing for me is that, first of all, the third act is where <cite>Adaptation</cite> becomes some much more like Kaufman's other work (I'm saying in clear recognition of the fact that my knowledge of that "other work" is <cite>Being John Malkovich.)</cite>  But also, having complained from the start about "life not being like that" and whatnot, <cite>Adaptation</cite> does have a nice, clear three act structure, which is the most basic Hollywood formula joke, you know?<br/><br/>(edit:) But even more than that, I can't help thinking that the Charlie character has missed the point of the advice he's given.  Well told, there's a good story in taking the bus to work.  The laser-sharking, the murder and genocide and all that, doesn't necessarily help to make a good story.  But the big stories are all around us, and you can see them in the faces of the strangers you pass in the street.                        </div>
