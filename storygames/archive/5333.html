They must come to life in play.<br/>A second character with a relation to the first character, defined by their relation to the character.<br/><br/>And possibly:<br/>And organization, perhaps defined by a specific member.<br/>A prop, and its relation to a character.<br/>A place, and its relation to a character.<br/><br/>Not every entry can have or should have all of these, but they seem to be a big thing.  In the text's own sample play, the Exorcist, the Spirit, and the woman going to marry all have lots of explicit detail built in.  The herders are looser, but still offer many threads, especially when connected to the other elements.<br/><br/>What else is out there that makes an oracle reading pop for you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119973/#Comment_119973" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T14:52:44+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  2:52PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2008 3:09PM by Ry.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to see an oracle with 4 kinds of elements:<br/><br/>A threatens B<br/>C wants D<br/>E is an asset to F<br/>G complicates or hinders H<br/><br/>Where each ABCDEFGH has a concrete character it calls out in addition to anything else it establishes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119978/#Comment_119978" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T15:07:31+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  3:07PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The good ones remind me of fly fishing lures -- they have a body, and then all sorts of frills and hooks and dangling shiny things come off at weird angles.

(Mostly because some of my pulp ones I think are pretty weak.) I was musing about putting up a 'Lame Oracle' at Abulafia, where people could post all the bad ideas...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then this happened in my head:<br/>\n<br/>\nExample 'Lame Oracle' draw:<br/>\n<br/>\nA pie sitting on a windowsill.<br/>\nA man going fishing.<br/>\nA kid with time on his hands.<br/>\nA meeting between two strangers.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeesh. That's about as bad as I could come up with. No flavor, no indication of setting, background, or possible interests. Nada.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, identify the characters: The pie implies someone who baked it -- a homemaker, since it's sitting on a windowsill and not in a bakery or something. The fisherman and the kid are explicit, as are the two strangers... Homemaker, man going fishing, kid -- this all looks like 'The Andy Griffith Show' in my head now: 50's Americana. Again; yeesh.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if the players really grab this and try to wring 'To Kill A Mockingbird' out of it instead? Ok, one player grabs a stranger, and makes him the 'other man', the man the homemaker cheated with once, who's back in town to pick up the affair. And someone else makes the other stranger the town gossip, a nice old biddy with her nose in everybody else's business. And what if the kid tried to steal the pie, and saw through the window what was going on when the 'other man' and the homemaker were alone in her house while her husband was off fishing...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is going to wind up with betrayal, poison and murder in a small town, you just know.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I guess I'm saying is, I'm not sure there are 'lame oracle entries'. Some are better than others, of course, but if the players really push, anything can be turned into a good story with this game."<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the few days since then, I've refined my thought about good and lame entries:  My 'lame' examples are lame because they have no flavor -- they add nothing concrete to the setting.  They lack the 'explicit detail' that you mentioned.  You can make something out of them, but you have to work at it.  Looking at what people are putting up on Abulafia, the ones that I think are the best are the ones that are 'grabby', that have some detail that <i>immediately</i> inspires a thought about a character or situation that I can derive from the entry.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes a good oracle is harder.  An oracle's individual entries should all work together.  Vincent's oracles are one big oracle, divided into themes.  Stick within one of the four, and you get bits that more easily go together.  (I tried that with the pulp oracles I started, but rather than dividing them up by story-theme I divided them up into 'types' of pulp, so that you don't have to get your weird science in with your gritty detective work, unless you want to.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne trick might be to create a few entries that are actually too vague to be 'good' entries on their own, but that can be read as modifiers to whatever else the oracle delivers.  'A site where wicked ghosts gather and dance.'  Just making it 'a site' is vague read by itself, the entry would be better if there was a concrete type of site -- but if the oracle also gives up 'A prestigious monastery, home to an order of warrior ascetics.' as another of the draws, then bang, it's obviously a haunted monastery, and the imagination is off and running.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are my current (rambling) thoughts on the subject.  Hope they help.<br/>\n--<br/>\nDainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119992/#Comment_119992" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T16:25:03+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  4:25PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me a good oracle entry is something that conjures an idea, a character, or a situation without actually laying anything down in stone. <br><br>For example, "A company of desert horsemen, hiding a woman amongst them" is great because it gives me an image: desert horsemen, the beginning of a situation -- the woman, what is she doing there, why is she hiding? -- several possible characters (horsemen, woman, who they are hiding her from) with none mandated. <br><br>The point, for me, is to get the juices of the people around the table going. Give them something archetypal without being generic, give them something kinda cool and cheesy, give them something to work from -- but don't actually give them a situation or a pre-set setting bit to use without modification. The whole brilliance of the game is taking these bits of stuff that get caught in the mesh of the mind and turning them into a story together. <br><br>So far, I find that the thing that works best for me is pictures. Like, going through the Rifts MRB, I got most of my best Oracle ideas from the pictures. Who is that? What are they doing? Where are they going? Why is this cool? Now fit it into one sentence, and no fancy double clauses, and slam it into the oracle. <br><br>Boom.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120003/#Comment_120003" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T17:38:57+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  5:38PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Interestingly described person or group, verb phrasing a noun phrase]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120009/#Comment_120009" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T18:24:25+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  6:24PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5208&amp;page=1#Item_80" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5208&amp;page=1#Item_80</a> - Just in case it's rather buried in the other thread.<br><br>Otherwise, what Brand said.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120043/#Comment_120043" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T21:12:01+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  9:12PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Collected Oracular Wisdom:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>Think of 5 broad categories for your Oracle things.

Have everybody write down two elements on 3x5 cards. If there are people around who're going to go to bed instead of playing, get them to write down two elements too anyway. Put them in a bowl.

Her selection is limited but that's okay.<br><br>4. After the session, have everybody write down another element or two. Add them to the bowl. I think that for it to work long-term you'll need to add more than 4 elements per session - but I don't forsee your friends having any trouble with that.<br><br>Maybe when I'm home this afternoon I'll post the elements that we created for this game.<br><br>There you go! My big idea here is to play In a Wicked Age Over the Edge using these oracle-on-the-fly rules.<br><br>My big concern is that the events of the session will unduly narrow the new elements you create. One of the best things about the In a Wicked Age oracles is the curves they throw you, the nonhomogeneity of the elements.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Oracle making:<br/><br/>Open the comic book/novel/dvd that is your inspirational material.
