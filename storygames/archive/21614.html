This newsletter was the brainchild of Kira Magrann and Anna Kreider, who then enlisted Misha Bushyager and Kimberley Lam to help with planning and execution.<br/><br/>It's a biweekly email featuring a roundup of games and game designers by marginalized designers to boost awareness and help them reach new audiences.<br/><br/>If you'd like to sign up, click here: <a href="https://patreon.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c71a6dc90e8b0c6728a9e2dcb&amp;id=6eadbc8c82" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://patreon.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c71a6dc90e8b0c6728a9e2dcb&amp;id=6eadbc8c82</a><br/><br/>If you'd like to support this effort, help them at their patreon: <a href="http://patreon.com/moreseatsrpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://patreon.com/moreseatsrpg</a><br/><br/>And if there's a project you want to see boosted, submit here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-M9x-5NL5uCm2CRgcjaEe486stxI14UozcFFK3YxpSA/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-M9x-5NL5uCm2CRgcjaEe486stxI14UozcFFK3YxpSA/edit</a><br/><br/>Personally, I think discoverability and accessibility is really important, and really underserved in our community. It's why I ran the Story Games Newsletter for two years, and it's why I'm excited about this. Taking the loving attention we lavish on the most popular designers and spreading it around can really make a big difference: I have loved so many first games from new designers, and I know that just having some people give feedback or praise or even just their time can often mean the world to a person just starting out.<br/><br/>These are good people, and I can't wait to see their curated picks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472846/#Comment_472846" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-24T23:37:59+00:00" title="April 24, 2018 11:37PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So this is a super cool thing, but the separation of femmes from women as a category is really icky, especially since it's redefined in that type of wording into "feminine non-women".

Which is really really shitty and awful.<br/><br/>This project is cool, and I want to support it in theory, but like... as a lesbian, that language is very very much a hard "no".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472848/#Comment_472848" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-24T23:52:09+00:00" title="April 24, 2018 11:52PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's how it goes - you define a nice theory term, and once it's released to the wilds, people are going to redefine it to exhaustion [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" title="EmmatheExcrucian"><img alt="EmmatheExcrucian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/892/nSNTGS8B31FGT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">EmmatheExcrucian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472850/#Comment_472850" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-25T00:04:29+00:00" title="April 25, 2018 12:04AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's very much true.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_472856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472856/#Comment_472856" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-25T08:56:26+00:00" title="April 25, 2018  8:56AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian">@EmmatheExcrucian</a> I suspect the people behind this would be receptive to your comments on language if you brought that up with them!<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I've started seeing the word "femme" pop up in purely visual descriptions - such as illustration captions - a "femme person" broadly meaning a character in a dress, long hair, and/or other obvious traditional displays of femininity. I interpreted that as a way of attempting not to conflate gender presentation with gender <i>identity</i> - thus avoiding words such as "woman" which might be assuming more than meets the eye - which seemed thoughtful to me.<br/>It didn't occur me this was a redefining of the word "femme" as much broader than its original meaning in lesbian communities, and as such it might hurt people who identify as femme.

This is Anna, one of the creators of More Seats. I'd like to kindly request that we not invest more energy in this line of conversation, as: 1) it distracts from the conversation we are trying to promote - which is how to promote the works of marginalized designers and 2) the insistence that "femme" is a term that only applies to cis lesbians is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_transgender_topics#Feminist_exclusion_of_trans_women" rel="nofollow">a staple of TERF rhetoric</a>.<br/><br/>It's true that femme was a word created by lesbians to describe the butch/femme dynamic. But language grows and changes! And femme is a VERY useful word to describe trans and non-binary experiences! ESPECIALLY when discussing non-binary trans people who are femme but not women. However, it's also a very useful shorthand when used as "women and femmes" to signify that a space is welcoming to NOT JUST cisgender women - but also trans women and non-binary people, etc, etc. The use of "femme" as a word that describes a wide variety of experience is a staple of inclusive non-binary and trans-inclusive language. <br/><br/>Insisting that "femme" is a term that only can be claimed by AFAB cisgender people is binary-centric and transphobic and is very much against the spirit of what Misha, Kim, Kira, and I are trying to achieve with More Seats. This is especially close to home for myself as a genderqueer non-binary person - I am very invested in language that reflects me and my experience.<br/><br/>If you would like more information on the evolution of "femme" as it pertains to gender conversations, <a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/what-we-mean-when-we-say-femme-a-roundtable-341842/" rel="nofollow">there is a great piece on Autostraddle here</a>.

I'm saying you need to be a woman,  and you need to be a lesbian.<br/>Also, I'm a trans woman,  so the implication that I'm a terf is extremely unwelcome.<br/>But that happens when you come in guns blazing reactionary. <br/>The way that you read into things thinking that I meant cis women only tbh has me a bit questioning whether you view trans women as women, because the way you're putting it there, it feels like you're saying trans women don't belong in the woman category.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472919/#Comment_472919" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-25T21:23:38+00:00" title="April 25, 2018  9:23PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for clarifying the stakes in the use of those words.
