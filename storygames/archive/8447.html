But that setting has been so game-fied and re-used as to make fit many different styles of play (although some better than others).<br/><br/>But what I'd like to hear is what games would you use if you were playing the original three Star Wars movies - not as they are, but as they might have been?  Imagine you've heard almost nothing, about Star Wars, and instead your group decides to play a space opera with a smuggler named Han Solo, a princess named Leia, and wanna-be pilot named Luke Skywalker, and a smart talking robot named R2D2. What game would turn that starting point into something that could have the themes and events in the original three movies?<br/><br/>Extra points if the game actively supports those themes and the cinematic space opera action, rather than simply not getting in the way.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186891/#Comment_186891" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T13:45:13+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  1:45PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really what I was looking for in that original thread.

Thank you for clarifying my murkiness.</blockquote>\nWell, it's an interesting distinction.  When someone to me says, "What system would you use to do this <i>setting</i>?" my brain tends to lock up.<br/><br/>But this time around we're focusing on "a space opera with a smuggler named Han Solo, a princess named Leia, and wanna-be pilot named Luke Skywalker, and a smart talking robot named R2D2."<br/><br/>It's just me, I know, but modeling fictional environments boggles me.  Characters in motion, I know how to do.  And for me the distinction between the two requests is huge.  (But, again, that's me.)<br/><br/><br/>My go to game for this would be <i>HeroQuest</i>.  (I'm only familiar with the last edition, not the upcoming one.)<br/><br/>The Traits allow all sorts of cool things to happen in terms of personality (Luke: IMPATIENT 17), relationships (Luke: IN LOVE WITH PRINCESS 22), occupations (PRINCESS 22, SMUGGLER 24), home cultures (FURTHEST PLACE FROM THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE 17... or whatever the line is...)  and so on.<br/><br/>Jedi powers could either as an umbrella skill or breaking it out into unique abilities (telekinesis, mind control, so on).  All the crazy light saber stuff is abstracted enough to be a snap, allowing whatever color players want to add.<br/><br/>The two resolution systems mean that blowing away a group of Storm Troopers shouldn't take up too much time.... <br/><br/>But if things go wrong you can break out the bidding system, and every time you swing across a chasm in a huge Death Star or SWOOSH between some asteroids to lose a TIE Fighter you're committing an action for the next round.  Because the resolution system is so elastic you can move across all sorts of tactics to try to win the day all in one fight: "Luke, I am your father..." is just one more attempt to dominate a scappy kid, along with bashing with him objects hurled by use of the Force, or trying to knock his light saber from his hands.<br/><br/>Super-heroic craziness is supported by the Hero Points.  The Points can also be used to cement objects to a character (light sabers, for example), or cement improvements one might make to objects (like a beat up freighters named <i>Millenium Falcon</i>.)<br/><br/>The game also supports the gathering of our Heroes into a Hero Band as they team up, which gives them advantages directly in the mechanics.  <br/><br/>New connections can be added as Traits as needed. (Luke: FATHER 21) and so on.<br/><br/>The game won't get bogged down in lots of minutia about how things "really" work ("Okay, so how much damage does an X-Wing Fighter do against the Death Star's hull?") since the focus of the game is PCs in conflict with something else and that's it.  ("Okay, extended contest.  Luke, you're coming up on the first laser cannon of your run.  Here we go....")<br/><br/>It even handles Luke's HeroQuest on Dagobah, when he battles his father and finds only himself.<br/><br/>Heroic deeds and over the top action inspired by passion, loyalties and personality with a system that supports moment by moment addition of color while still robustly handling resolution mechanically.<br/><br/>All in all, it seems like the perfect go-to for me.<br/><br/>Christopher                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186900/#Comment_186900" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T14:23:06+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  2:23PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2009 2:29PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jedibunny</cite>Oh, or maybe I'd hack <em>InSpectres</em></blockquote>\nThat's a cool idea!

Just imagine Han Solo replaced by a wookie bounty hunter, C3PO and R2D2 replaced by an academic technician on the run, and Obi Wan Kenobi replaced by a Jedi pacifist. They have the Death Star plans and know that Leia has been captured, but they haven't decided what to do about it. <br/><br/>The game in question is Homeworld Project - my Astral Space Opera game. I'm well pleased with how the revised rules are working, so I suspect I'll be in search of external playtesting after we finish up.<br/><br/>    - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192145/#Comment_192145" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T14:16:15+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  2:16PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2009 5:41PM by Nathan_H.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd use something like a simplified TSOY, with Keys functioning somewhat like Lifepaths<br/>You'd use a Key, and instead of it adding XPs which(in TSOY)are used to increase Abilities, those XPs would Buy-Off that Key.  <br/>So, let's say Luke would have Whiny, Student, Mentor.  <br/>Han would have something like Smug, Hero, Martyr.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192163/#Comment_192163" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T17:53:09+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  5:53PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no clue how ya do the scenes without the traditional characters.<br/>I mean do you have someone play Vader?<br/>There's a bunch of Vader scenes throughout A New Hope.<br/>Maybe something like With Great Power?<br/>Do you need to show the villians plan?<br/>That's really typical for movie serials, showing just the bad guys ploting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192169/#Comment_192169" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-11T18:58:50+00:00" title="February 11, 2009  6:58PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan,<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, so far Homeworld Project seems to be delivering the revelation of the bad guys aspect. Vader has manifested, and influenced events, although he hasn't gotten physically near any of the main characters (the closest being the techy escaping from Leia's ship after shielding his life signs in the escape pod). And I've already found it easier to describe one of my required GM actions (building tension as the chapter ends) as a shot which none of the characters are aware. <br/><br/>    - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
