I am most fascinated by <b>The Mountain Witch</b>, despite its apparent PvP aspect \u2013 something I usually don\u2019t fancy. Though the <b>Blackwind Project</b> is quite interesting as well, as are <b>Triumvene</b>, <b>Gather </b>(a GM-less game) and <b>Helheim</b>.<br/>The new edition of <b>Black Hack</b> is the Fantasy RPG I am most interested in. The package sounds i, on the other hand,e something. <b>Harvesters</b> on the other hand does feature small animal creatures in a fantasy setting, which looks quite cute and charming. Though <b>Quest</b> as well as <b>Dragonscales</b> look solid as well.<br/>Among the \u201enormal\u201c RPGs I consider <b>Starship Infernum</b> and <b>Secret Agents of CROSS</b> worth a look. Though, as with the previous collection, my current budget is quite tight, thus no backing this time around.<br/>You\u2019ll find quite a plenty of other projects, supplements, adventures, dice and other projects. Even three cool looking notebook projects. Well, and I do like well done notebooks.<br/><br/>If you are interested in foreign language projects. There is the <b>Changeling 20\xba Aniversario</b> by Nosolorol, which does offer quite a cool looking version. Among the French projects I find <b>Sneffels</b> \u2013 for the name alone \u2013 and <b>Tecumah Gulch</b> \u2013 which might produce a Far West edition before GMS worth having a look. The Italian game <b>Caos</b> will apparently be as well available in English.<br/>In regards of the German crowdfundings, there is the translation of <b>Mythic Britain</b> on the one hand, on the other hand you\u2019ll find Havena \u2013 Versunkene Geheimnisse a sourcebook for <b>The Dark Eye</b>, which comes with a cover Havena \u2013 Uh nana which I happen to quite like.<br/><br/>You\u2019ll find those projects and quite some more in this list:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>4 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>5 Story Game Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Setting<br/>3 Supplements<br/>5 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>3 Campaigns<br/>2 Adventures<br/>3 D&amp;D Adventures<br/>1 Role-Playing Game Creator<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>2 Dice Accessoires<br/>3 Notebooks<br/>2 Various RPG Projects<br/>4 RPG Hybrids<br/>3 Various Games<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Supplements<br/>1 Role-Playing Game App<br/>1 Terrain Project<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Campaign<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 RPG Comic<br/><br/><b>Portuguese Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/>Blog-Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/06/10/crowdfunding-collection-76/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/06/10/crowdfunding-collection-76/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474689/#Comment_474689" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-12T14:42:41+00:00" title="June 12, 2018  2:42PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I couldn't tell much about the system for Quest from the Kickstarter beyond "simplified D&amp;D with pretty art".

The game uses d6, looks for doubles and adds some more narrative mechanics into the mix. The creators are experienced as this will be the second edition of the game. <b>Dark Times</b> on the other hand combines Cyberpunk and Supers with its setting. The players do assume the roles of superpowered human beings that have been created by companies who view them as their property and nothing more than tools. The system is somewhat similar and based on Wicked Packs as well as Spy and there\u2019s a video explaining it. <b>Survive the Night</b> is a horror role-playing game in which a group of teenagers has to survive several scenarios. Based on the video there are 5 ready-made characters and 4 pre-made scenarios to get started with.  <b>Blackwind</b> is the recurring entry. I mentioned the game in the previous collection, yet missed the Patreon. Thus, if you want to support the creators and the game on a regular basis, there you go.<br/>I did notice <b>Advanced Labyrinth Lord</b> and <b>Tavern Guide</b> as two supplements that caught my eye as they appear to offer a lot. Among the applications you might like to take a look at <b>YARPS</b>, the idea looks nice, yet the creators do need some more backing to realize it.<br/><b>Bolsa Drag\xf3n</b>, a spanish project for dice bags caught my eye, because it\u2019s done by El artesano del Rey, who\u2019ll be as well creating the luxury edition of V5, and offer quite an eye-catcher.<br/>Though there are plenty more projects,.. dice, adventures, campaigns,.. you can see for yourself:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Supplements<br/>3 Campaigns<br/>2 Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>1 Dice Accessory<br/>2 RPG Apps<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 RPG Comic<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Dice Accessory<br/><br/><b>Portuguese Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Setting<br/>1 RPG-Comic<br/><br/>Blog-Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/06/17/crowdfunding-collection-77/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/06/17/crowdfunding-collection-77/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474875/#Comment_474875" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-17T23:07:15+00:00" title="June 17, 2018 11:07PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Advanced Labyrinth Lord was what we were playing when we had the original Mirror Story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474900/#Comment_474900" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T20:23:07+00:00" title="June 18, 2018  8:23PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope you enjoyed it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>I have yet to play it, yet the project sounded quite intriguing                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474901/#Comment_474901" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T20:31:28+00:00" title="June 18, 2018  8:31PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2018 8:35PM by 2097.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a very good game and for sure the best version of 1e I can think of.
