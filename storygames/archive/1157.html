                    This is a mechanics I keep reinventing periodically, and always think I'll have a good use for...yet anything I've put it in has gone moldering. Maybe it'll be useful to someone else. It's just a resolution rolling method.<br/><br/>The player rolls a size of die depending on attributes, etc. d4, d6, d8, d10 or d12. The GM will probably do the same for NPCs, points he spends, whatever. Each person finds their success level below:<br/><br/>1-3 -- Banality<br/>4-6 -- Solidness<br/>7-9 -- Coolness<br/>10-12 -- Awesomeness<br/><br/>You'll note that this puts a definite cap on how much an unskilled character can achieve, and yet increasing skill is also largely a matter of being more reliable, and even then success isn't automatic.<br/><br/>Nominally then, whoever has the higher level of success wins the conflict or succeeds at his action. You could easily have players rolling more than one die, and maybe consider just the best result then. You could also attach specific outcomes to each level of success, nevermind overall winner or loser of the roll.<br/><br/>I'm still looking for a home for this thing, but maybe you'll have one first.                </div>

                            Very close to what I'm doing!<br/>
I've changed the core mechanic of my game from d20 to a sliding scale of d4 to d20.  No modifiers (adding, subtracting, dividing, etc.) and only rarely multiple dice.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really excited about how it's coming together!<br/>

                            That's neat, Jasper.  You could also nip the d12 and include some kind of bonus deal for achieving awesomeness, which would ordinarily be just out of reach of all but the best, luckiest dudes.                        </div>

                            Yeah, that's true, Jason. Though rellying on die sizes does cut down the number of options (5) so I wanted as many as reasonably possible. Instead, you could modify the scale and create a fifth "super-duper" achievement level. Such as...<br><br>1-2 -- Banality<br>3-5 -- Solidity<br>6-8 -- Coolness<br>9-11 -- Awesomeness<br/>12 -- Super-duperitude<br/><br/>(This scheme also makes it a little more interesting for the guy rolling a d6 and a little less depressing for the guy with the d4.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah, I'm gonna echo the whole 'this overlaps a fair bit with some thoughts I've had about sliding-scale die size stuff'.<br/><br/>Though in my initial thoughts, I was mainly just thinking about success/failure, with the idea that 1-2 or 1-3 = failure, and 3+ or 4+ = success.  But splitting those out into two or three number wide rungs is definitely nice.                        </div>

                            How about:<br/><br/>1: Failure<br/>2-3: Banality<br/>4-5: Solidity<br/>6-7: Coolness<br/>8-9: Righteousness<br/>10-11: Awesomeness<br/>12: Super-awesomeness<br/><br/>That way, the highest roll on each die is in the next category up - it's special.

                            Heh. Righteousness. <br/><br/>The reason I stuck to just a few categories, was because I usually can't think of interesting ways to differentiate more than a few. You're almost at the point of 1 for 1...in which case why have levels? Plus, with failure being only on a 1, the d10 guy sees that pretty infrequently...of course it depends on how you interpret "fail" -- you'll note I never use it, because I hate that "whiff" sound it makes.                        </div>

                            OK, some further thoughts on this.<br/><br/>Rather than a "task resolution" approach I'm going to take a "conflict resolution" approach that assumes there are always dice being rolled against each other. (If the environment can have attributes in FATE, it can have dice in this system.) So the numbers are margins of victory.<br/><br/>A d8 means you are average at whatever it is you are bringing to the conflict. A d6 is below average/wounded/impaired, a d4 incompetent/badly wounded/badly impaired, d10 above average, d12 some kind of outstanding hero or expert. Possibly a d2 (binary dice, 1 for odds, 2 for evens) could be introduced for when you're below average and badly impaired or something.<br/><br/>So, margins of victory:<br/><br/>0 - you didn't achieve your goal, but you are still well set up for another try.<br/>1-2 - you made some progress towards your goal but you need a good victory next time to achieve it.<br/>3-4 - you made good progress towards your goal and even a low victory next time will get it.<br/>5-6 - you achieved your goal in a "meh" kind of way.<br/>7-8 - you achieved your goal impressively.<br/>9-10 - you achieved your goal impressively and gained some kind of minor or temporary benefit (e.g. a larger die for your next roll).<br/>11 - you achieved your goal stunningly and gained some kind of major or permanent benefit. Some kind of fortunate coincidence may have been involved.<br/><br/>Margins of defeat:<br/>-1-2 - you not only didn't achieve your goal, you now have a new minor complication between you and your goal; some kind of environmental change which could be an unfortunate coincidence, etc.<br/>-3-4 - you have a significant new complication between you and your goal.<br/>-5-6 - you definitely will not achieve that goal, you can't try again; circumstances have rendered it impossible.<br/>-7-8 - you have some minor or temporary drawback (e.g. a smaller die for your next roll).<br/>-9-10 - you have some major or permanent drawback.<br/>-11 - dude, you are so screwed. You're going to need at least one more scene to get out of this one.<br/><br/>This ties all the outcomes to narrative directly, which I like.                        </div>
