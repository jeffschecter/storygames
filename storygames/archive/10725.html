Her dad bought her cheap bags of plastic dinosaurs made in Hong Kong from the local dime store:<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="1.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/tmp/1.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nNow even as an 8 year old kid, Terry was some what of a dinosaur expert. She would consume book after book on all things dinosaur. So when she found a "dinosaur" in the bags her dad bought her that looked like a clawless giant lobster with a propeller for a tail... she knew something was up!<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="2.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/tmp/2.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nNonetheless she loved playing with it! Shrimpy, her name for it, vexed her for years, providing hours of curious daydreaming imagining what the hell Shrimpy was.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 years later, Terry plays Dungeons and Dragons for the first time, the Monster Manual being her favorite part! Where to her surprise she finds:<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="3.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/tmp/3.jpg"/><br/>\n<img alt="4.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/tmp/4.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nWhat? Shrimpy is a rust monster?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo this day the rust monster is her favorite D&amp;D; monster. She still has Shrimpy at her parents house.<br/>\n<br/>\nToday she shared this story with me. So of course I ran online to see what I could find. And find I did!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rust monster's appearance is based on a plastic toy that was sold in toy stores during the 1970s and 1980s in cheap bags of plastic monsters and dinosaurs. Gary Gygax wrote about the inspiration for the rust monster: <i>"When I picked up a bag of plastic monsters made in Hong Kong at the local dime store to add to the sand table array ... there was the figurine that looked rather like a lobster with a propeller on its tail ... nothing very fearsome came to mind ... Then inspiration struck me. It was a rust monster."</i> \u2014Gary Gygax<br/>\n<br/>\nCool!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that struck me looking this up is the badassification (and gigantification) of previously cute and wondrous D&amp;D; monsters.

The illustration was the spitting image of the toy. Another AD&amp;D monster that clearly originated from a plastic monster toy I owned is the bulette. Did Terry also have the bulette toy? I bet she did.

I'm sure I still have it around somewhere, although it was badly chewed up by an animal some time ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238065/#Comment_238065" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T15:43:37+00:00" title="October 18, 2009  3:43PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a little in awe over why people are drawn to certain, often very specific things.<br>I have no clue why as a kid I was so into the stegosaurus?<br>Why that and why not  the triceratops?<br>I'm pretty sure I had those identical plastic dinosaurs.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_238093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238093/#Comment_238093" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-18T22:32:51+00:00" title="October 18, 2009 10:32PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had that set, too.
