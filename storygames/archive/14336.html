I'll let Joel bring up his dice idea if he wants, but it directly leads into idea the first:  fixing up the character sheet.  Joel's idea is a reaction to the big colorful chart, but I'm looking at cleaning it up, bringing the relevant information to the character sheet under the attribute.  The character sheet will have a box on it for each of the attributes, plus additional boxes for powers, skills, etc.  This box will contain the attribute name, the rank name, the rank value, and a mini-chart with two columns: one for dice ranges, the second with  white, green, yellow, and red spaces.  You just write down the dice roll ranges for the rank.  For instance, a character with Remarkable Fighting would write down 01-35 for white, 36-65 for green, 66-94 for yellow, and 95-100 for red.  When you're using Fighting, it's a lot quicker lookup than cross referencing the full chart.  The stats boxes could also contain the relevant portions of the battle effects table (with miss, hit, slam, stun, kill, etc.) to save another lookup.  <br/><br/>At some point I'll throw together a mockup of what I'm talking about (but I'm not a graphic designer, so it'll be thrown together in OpenOffice and exported to PDF).  It could also be used with only slight modification for Joel's dice idea.  <br/><br/>Idea the second:  Besides the "usual" kinds of stuff (relationship maps and so forth) the first idea that comes to mind is players "betting" Karma points on the things they want to do in the session.  For instance, in this session Spider-Man's player wants to see some three-way relationship drama between him, Mary Jane, and Gwen, so he decides to bet 30 Karma on that.  He's not too interested in villain fights this time around, but does want to see some of his rogues' gallery put in an appearance, so he throws down 10 each on the Green Goblin and Sandman.  Payout is at 2-1, so when he resolves the MJ-Gwen-Peter thing he gets back 60, and 20 each for the two villains.  <br/><br/>There's two corollaries to this: <br/><br/>1.  The bigger bets are the bigger payoff and so are more of the focus of the session; the other things are sidelines at best.  <br/><br/>2.  These bets become GM budget.  When Spider-Man puts down 30 Karma on that relationship thing, the GM now has 30 Karma to spend to make things interesting, plus 10 each on the Goblin and Sandy.  <br/><br/>And 1 and 2 taken in conjunction can also mean that maybe the GM can sort of poke the bigger issues into the smaller; like, for instance, Peter gets distracted on his way to get to MJ or Gwen by the Goblin robbing a bank.  While he's on his errand for MJ, the GM decides that 5 of his MJ-Gwen budget are going to be used to put Gwen in harm's way in this scene.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325635/#Comment_325635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-21T13:36:58+00:00" title="May 21, 2011  1:36PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2011 7:47PM by Nathan_H.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You cannot awesome-i-fy awesome.<br/><br/>I think Karma could be simplified and personalized, if you chose to keep it.<br/>There is like a million things I would do differently.<br/>I'd be hard-pressed to play Marvel Super Heroes(Basic or Advanced)as written.

When I got my first couple of adventures and character books, and saw that the provided character writeups didn't use the power descriptions in the original books, a light went on in my head.  From that point on, I never rolled a die to create a character.  If I were going to do that now I'd probably insist on rolling power levels, but otherwise letting players just describe their own abilities.  (I did a lot of things like "so-and-so can do such-and-such (insert paragraph on what it does) with Remarkable intensity and range".)<br/><br/>Before I do any serious work on hacking the system proper, though, I'm going to play it as written.  I owe the game that much; after 25+ years the glasses get pretty rosy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326042/#Comment_326042" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T23:23:21+00:00" title="May 23, 2011 11:23PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Chris Goodwin</cite>Maybe "resolve" was the wrong word for me to use.

I'm actually gearing up for a one-shot in a few weeks, so I'd appreciate comments &amp; analysis on the text as written, <i>especially</i> from the people who are like, "This game needs to be heavily reworked."<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's stuff I think the game does reasonably well for its era:<br/>\n<span style="color:#009900">* Licensed setting/characters with enormous amount of fan-enthusiasm.  Lots of published support material.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Characters can be pegged to certain objective performances, permitting comparison.  "Wolverine is a better fighter than the Hulk.  How about that?"<br/>\n<br/>\n* Therefore there's an objective sense of difficulty missing in Forge-supers games with freeform traits, like <i>Capes</i> and <i>With Great Power</i>.  In this game, If Aunt May wants to defeat Galactus, she will have to goddamn <i>work</i> for it.  (This is potentially very problematic, though; see below)<br/>\n<br/>\n* Lasting character improvement is glacially slow (just like in the comics), but the hero-point mechanic works around this by basically permitting characters to function above and beyond what they'd normally be capable of.  So you don't really gather up XP to improve yourself, rather accumulate and then burn resources to kick ass.  There's nothing innovative about this in 2011, but it's still a decent solution to the unchanging world of comics.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The hero-points are rewarded for crime-fighting.  If you want to be effective, you need to be heroic.<br/>\n<br/>\n* RPG rules written by Spider-Man!</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some places where I think the game falls down:<br/>\n<span style="color:#CC0000">* Using objective difficulty - the Hulk really is stronger than Spider-Man - ignores the fact that in comics, everyone can beat everyone else, depending on the needs of the plot.  There's always some lateral thinking approach that works wonders.  The trouble is that here, the GM is the controller of whether those lateral approaches exist in the first place.  You need to factor in some degree of Director Stance here for the players to really get creative.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Fixed damage vs. fixed damage-reduction leads to an arms race.<br/>\n<br/>\n* No minion rules.  If Nightcrawler needs four punches to take down a street-thug, something's wrong.  (Nightcrawler's whole deal is that he's pretty good taking out mobs of wimpy guys.)<br/>\n<br/>\n* Combat is pretty static as written: run up to a guy and exchange blows.  Combat in the comics is dynamic, with all kinds of crazy things happening left and right.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The Resource system is screwy, both in the Basic Game (where it's basically gold pieces and you spend it on everything) and the Advanced Game (where it's treated as a standard ability score so you don't have to handle routine expenses, but is harder to save up every penny for a huge expenditure)<br/>\n<br/>\n* The Inventing sub-system is built around the Resource system.  So if Resources are wack, Inventing is wack too.  There's this huge bottleneck of funding to complete any serious invention.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Scenario creation rules are non-existent.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The published modules are uniformly <i>terrible</i>.  Like, curse-Johannes-Gutenberg-for-making-it-possible terrible.<br/>\n<br/>\n* If the game is meant to be run as a sandbox, there needs to be more support given to that style of play.  (I.e., more random tables that present fun situations)<br/>\n<br/>\n* Wholly original characters don't have enough "flags."  Canon characters only have "flags" if you're familiar with them from comics.<br/>\n<br/>\n* The hero-point system has penalties that seem to be affected by a Hobson's Choice, i.e., "You can save the world or you can go on a date with Mary Jane."  This would seem to invite pretty coercive GM'ing.  (Also, it's not really a choice, since saving the world earns you +40 Karma or whatever, while ignoring your girlfriend only costs -10 Karma.  Saving the world is the rational choice every time.)</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure there are other problems too, but I think an attempt to Awesome-ize the game requires taking a look at what does and doesn't work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326133/#Comment_326133" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T10:19:09+00:00" title="May 24, 2011 10:19AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>I'm sure there are other problems too, but I think an attempt to Awesome-ize the game requires taking a look at what does and doesn't work.</blockquote>\nHence my wish to play it as written.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br><br>The Resource and Inventing rules are artifacts of 1980's RPG design.  It's "realistic" to track GP expenditures, therefore it is "realistic" to track funding for inventing.  I'd have to go back to the comics to see how they handle it, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't involve balance sheets and double entry bookkeeping.  If I were going to do it now, I'd make both "filthy rich" and "great inventor" powers, or things that act like them.  Make a roll, and you have your Maserati or (maybe with some Karma expenditure -- Power Stunt?) your frap-ray.  To whatever extent the Maserati is color, it doesn't need to be mechanized, and the frap-ray can be as one-shot as they come.  \n<blockquote>* Wholly original characters don't have enough "flags." Canon characters only have "flags" if you're familiar with them from comics.</blockquote>\nGood point, and this is part of what pulled me from MSH to Champions, back in the day.  But... easy fix: there's nothing mechanical requiring Spider-Man to have a Mary Jane and an Aunt May, but those are opportunities to earn Karma.  Why beg off an opportunity to earn Karma?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326136/#Comment_326136" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T10:45:49+00:00" title="May 24, 2011 10:45AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2011 10:58AM by John_Powell.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My friends briefly tried Marvel Supes back in the day and quickly went back to Champions because of many of the problems James listed.* <br><br><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14933.phtml" rel="nofollow">Icons</a> pretty much fixes all the problems I had with FASERIP.

If you want to use old FASERIP characters and modules, Icons' 1-10 ratings map exactly to FASERIP's Poor-&gt;Unearthly ranks.

Probably wouldn't bother me now, so go figure.<br><br>**If you are feeling super-nostalgic you can rename Icons stats from Prowess, Coordination, Strength, Intellect, Awareness, Willpower to <b>F</b>ighting, <b>A</b>gility, <b>S</b>trength, <b>R</b>eason, <b>I</b>nfluence, <b>P</b>erception.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326174/#Comment_326174" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T13:22:28+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  1:22PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and Marvel Super Heroes has rules for minions... sort of.<br>Let me actually read it!<br><br><b>Clobbering Lots of People</b>.  When I tackle a bunch of creeps at once, I don't waste muscle knocking them out one at a time.  Instead, I get 'em all with one Sunday punch, like Aunt Petunia taught me.  Anybody can do it, but it's not easy.  If a hero wants to smash more then one guy at once, he makes a FEAT roll using the ability that applies(Fighting for punching and Endurance for charging).  If the result is yellow or red the hero nails the whole bunch, friend or foe.  If it's green or white, he misses everybody.<br><br>Wrestling's a little bit different.  A hero can shake off any number of attackers with one yellow FEAT roll, but he needs special powers to grab more than two guys at once.<br><br>If a hero wants to mash a bunch of goons from a distance, there's only one way to do it: throw something really big, like a chunk of pavement.  Tossing something big effects everybody in the area, but they all get a chance to jump out of the way by making an Agility FEAT roll.  (Captain America can toss his shield into lots of clowns, but that's a special power.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326207/#Comment_326207" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T15:49:33+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  3:49PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nathan, that "...sort of" is significant:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had this happen in a game a year or two ago: a player is running Nightcrawler (Excellent Fighting, Typical Strength) when he gets jumped by a street gang, whose members have 24 Health points each.

I think you get to make multiple attacks by a Fighting feat, but the issue really is how durable your second-rate enemies are relative to a single attack, not how often you can try to hit them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that method would work on roughly 2.5% of all attacks (significantly more often if you're using an edged weapon, but still).  Alternately, there might be some <i>deus ex machina</i> in the environment - like trapping everyone in wet concrete, or an ultra-sonic stun ray - but that either requires the GM to set it up in advance or for the players to have some authority to create such things as needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can totally see a house-rule where minions automatically fail the Endurance feat, but it's still something that would only occur 5% of the time not counting Karma.  (I figure if you need to spend Karma to take out a minion, you probably shouldn't be a superhero.  But maybe I'm stacking the deck too much.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I'll admit that the idea of "minions" isn't appropriate to all superhero games: maybe in a pulp 1930's game, even ordinary joes ought to put up a good fight.  And I'm not sure how well "beta-supers" thrashing hordes of minions accords with Silver Age comics.  But by the mid-1980s, when the game was written, this was a pretty common thing even for relatively low-powered characters like Daredevil or Captain America to plow through armies of guys in a panel or two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326306/#Comment_326306" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T09:31:13+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  9:31AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2011 9:32AM by Nathan_H.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nameless thugs are meant to slow the heroes down.  <br>It could take a couple panels to wipe 'em out, even if you're Batman.<br>It should cost a little something if you wanna showboat, and take 'em out with one punch.<br>I'm talking about a gang of thugs not just one dude, if that's not clear. <br><br>Superhero rpg's have always been problematic, for reasons I won't go into.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326311/#Comment_326311" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T09:44:30+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  9:44AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You probably need to customize the rules depending on which comic book... or specifically... comic book writer you want to emulate. <br><br>The main issue I had with Marvel back in the day was rolling for multiple actions.

Like, "Here's the cart you can flip over.  This chained Tyrannosaurus can be spooked to snap its chains and run amok.  Here's a lava pit to push people into," and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure this stuff really needs to be in the hard rules of the game, per se, but it's definitely good "soft rules" for designing stuff.

So if you want to take out a Green Beret (remarkable level) you'd need to dish out 30 points.

Make sure it worked for that style of comic a bit better. For example the more problem Peter Parker faces (deals with but does not resolve) the more karma he gets to succeed when he needs. Essentially the more he suffers at one thing the better he does at another. Resolving a situation means he need to create another problem to face to earn karma. There is no free ride.<br><br>Secondly he can suffer serious negative changes, any hero can, and that gets them a lasting change to their hero. Of course the change could also come with a hidden negative. Such as the Black Suit, which helped him at first butt became insidious later.<br><br>No advancement rules at all, at least not without using such drama tied to it.  <br><br>I've always seen the game as resource based game with a randomizer cost reducer (dice rolls.)<br><br>I like the biding idea above, but I always have problems with games that make you the player/GM think about a mechanic as a mechanic too much. Pour whatever changes back into the characters viewpoint, make sure it comes and interacts with their point of view. Spidey makes a choice, make sure that choice gets him a rule effect, good or bad.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
