This worked ok with 3 people (GM + me + other player) but quickly caused problems with 4 or more people, as some people felt "left out"<br/><br/>As far as more possible, I think of Polaris as institutionalizing alpha-playerness, where the Heart is kinda a conventional player in the sense of controlling a protagonist, but also "carries" the game.<br/><br/>Actually, on reflection, I carried the first half of the campaign, but didn't do so the second half. Things that changed that made me abandon carrying the game:<br/><br/>1. Average number of players increased, so I intentionally mellowed out so others could have scene time.<br/><br/>2. Went from a high-information environment (city we all grew up in) to a low-information, mystery driven environment (mysterious magic wilderness)<br/><br/>3. Character had special resources in the first half (contacts, social status) that did not apply to second half.<br/><br/>4. GM constantly declared almost all my schemes catastrophic failures. Eventually whenever I got into character I felt as if she had "lost confidence" in her abilities and turtled.<br/><br/>5. Stakes increased from "can you help these other people" to "can you survive?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116012/#Comment_116012" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-22T07:53:28+00:00" title="December 22, 2007  7:53AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 22, 2007 7:55AM by Wolfe.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had this happen, though in a slightly different sense.. I won't say I've never had fall-down days where I wasn't up to the task of GMing, but that's not what I'm talking about. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm talking about those players who are enthusiastic and proactive. They don't wait for the GM to lay out the plots before them, they go forth and forge their own trails. For a GM that is cool with player empowerment, this type of player is a godsend. For more controlling GMs, this player is a nightmare. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn my longest-running V:tM game, this player became the leader of the Pack. At first he was just the social leader, inside and outside the game.. But eventually he decided that his character would make a bid for Pack Leader. Due to his proactivity, I essentially just reacted to the players' actions, instead of having to plan it all out and lead them along. Outside the game, he was the driving force for getting the players to meet every week. He's a large part of the reason I ended up having 12 players on the roster of that game. Thankfully, the number of active players at any time was never that high, but there was this one, crazy night...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my other long-running groups, it was usually my Co-GMs who ended up being this "Alpha Player", as I ended up being the Alpha Player in their games. The guy above hadn't ever really gamed before we met up, and had never run a game in his life, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne possibly bad thing I've noticed, on both sides, is that the Alpha Player can sometimes, unintentionally, hog the spotlight. As a GM, I found I tended to focus on the proactive, strong player more than the others. As a player, I found that my proactivity tended to turn the other players into followers, rather than equal contributors. This sort of thing is only really combatted by both the GM and the Alpha Player being aware of it, and actively working to not exclude the other players from the spotlight. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Cross-posted with William: That's exactly what I was talking about above!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for how to encourage this sort of play... I think player empowering mechanics are your best shot. My ReCoil (which I've been playtesting) definitely flows smoother with one or more strong, proactive players. For players less sure about taking the reins, it slows down a lot. I'm also thinking, in the case of ReCoil, that the possibilities are a little too wide open, which can contribute to the slow down, but the general point remains.. Player empowering mechanics only work when you've got at least one player who wants to be empowered.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116024/#Comment_116024" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-22T10:44:07+00:00" title="December 22, 2007 10:44AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've GM-ed whole campaigns where I would have gladly paid <i>cash money</i> for one or more players to step up and carry things, so this is a subject of great interest to me.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't think I have anything useful to <i>contribute</i> on the subject, but I'll be watching it closely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116028/#Comment_116028" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-22T11:52:53+00:00" title="December 22, 2007 11:52AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've <i>been</i> this player in a number of games.

I'm the loud-mouthed american in my group, always willing to say "Hey, lets go over here!" or "Say, don't <i>you</i> want to step in here?" and that's okay because I'm a transatlantic yob, in that role certainly. But there is a certain discomfort within that role, where you kind of feel like the GM's stooge, partner in crime as it were. The rest of the players cme to see your actions as being 'towing the line', and get tired of your apparent 2-dimensionality. And it gets tiring being the person everyone turns to to perk up the night when its a little slow. Worst, I personally do what I do to act as an example of how everyone could do this, but instead I often end up being the only one who does it.<br/><br/>Yeah, people feel like its not their job to collude with the GM to make plot happen, or that they would be interfering, but most people forget that half (or more - way more) of the GMs inspiration comes from the players and their characters. Games where this is avoided a little are some of those which deliberately give the players responsibilities to enact this role. Dust Devils does this for sure, Cold City similarly though to a slightly lesser degree.
