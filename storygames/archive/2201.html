                    So in a few other threads which I'm too lazy to link to right now, folks have been talking about tools and techniques that are applicable to most if not all roleplaying games.  The carpentry metaphor, comparing Ikea flatpack bookshelves against making your own bookshelves, comes up often.  We speculate after the existence of "the rotary saw of roleplaying" by which we mean a tool that could be used in multiple games just as a rotary saw can be used in multiple carpentry projects.<br/><br/>So what I'd like to do is brainstorm with you folks on what those (semi-)universal tools and techniques might be.  I'm not so interested in concepts (like flags) so much as actual things that players can do at or away from the table, before or during the game.  Here's an example:<br/><br/><strong><em>Character Background, the Jigsaw of Roleplaying</em></strong><br/><strong>How It's Used:</strong> Write up a relatively brief synopsis of your character's history prior to the start of the game.  Who were their parents, where did they grow up, and how did they discover that they had super powers / a great destiny / a certain roguish charm that made them become player characters?  The technique allows you to shape your character -- hence "jigsaw."<br/><strong>Benefits:</strong> The character background gives players context for their own characters, a place to start from and some specifics to ground their roleplaying in.  Actual play will often develop past the details of the character background, but especially for the first session the background gives a sense of where the character is coming from.  Additionally, GMs can mine the character backgrounds for material to include in the running game.<br/><strong>Limitations:</strong> Depending on player expectations, the character background can be "ignored" or "exploited" by the GM; without guidelines as to how the background should be incorporated into play, there is always the too much or too little problem.  Additionally, when the GM mines the background for material, it can be difficult identifying what is a flag for player interest and what is expository context uninteresting to the player.  If the character backgrounds are written in isolation, they can make threading characters together more difficult, since the characters become firmly entrenched in incompatible positions.<br/><br/>So tell me, Story Games: what's in your toolbox?                </div>

<b><i>Pre-loaded Character Color</i></b><br/><b>How It's used:</b> Look at your characters abilities, spells, skills, whatever - the things he or she can do in game. For any of these, you can come up with cool descriptions or phrases to use ahead of time. So instead of just saying 'I'm shooting him' it can be 'I flip the safety off my Kalishnikov and bring the stock to my shoulder'. Or 'My eyes glaze over in concentration as I focus my telepathy on him'.  You can write these on index cards or post-its or something for easy finding when you're in game.<br/><b>Benefits:</b> It adds variety, and gives you a chance to shine quickly at the game table. Plus, it can be done away from the table for fun when your group's not around. Good for both players and GMs.  Gives players a chance and a reason to contribute color in-game.<br/><b>Limitations:</b> It can certainly be overdone - to the point where its not clear what you're actually doing mechanically or to the point where its annoying to your group.                        </div>

<i><b>3x5 Cards of Doom</b></i><br/><b>How it's Used:</b> This is a GM tool.  The GM carries around a few 3x5 cards wherever he goes.  Every new idea the GM gets is put on a 3x5 card, and filed.  Ideas start off in an "inspiration" folder, and get moved up to an "on deck" folder when they're fully statted-up and prepared for play.  After they get used, they get moved to an "in play" folder, and if they can no longer be used, they get moved to a "graveyard" folder.  Notes are made on the cards when their status changes.  Artistic GM's can sketch pictures on the back.  Cards that are slated to be used in a particular play session can be pulled out and clipped together to simplify play.<br/><b>Benefits:</b> The GM has a ready resource to review all of the characters, locations, plots, etc. that are currently active in the game, or are ready to be brought into the game, that doesn't require power or an internet connection.<br/><b>Limitations:</b> Fiddling with cards adds handling time, moreso as the number of cards increases.<br/><br/>I've used this method many times and I'm a firm believer, especially when running DnD.                        </div>

<b><i>The Character Map</i></b><br/><br/><b>How It's Used:</b>  This is a sheet of paper depicting the network structure in which characters are enmeshed, linking them in terms of whatever relational ties are significant--kinship and sex only for the pure "relationship map," a la  <i>Sorceror</i>, broader in other uses.  <br/><br/>Simple Example:  Snape &lt;--- teacher/student (dislikes) ---&gt; Harry &lt;---student/teacher (likes) ---&gt; Dumbledore (with an additional link between Snape and Dumbledore).<br/><br/><b>Benefits:</b>  The patterns of interdependence among characters are easy to see, providing situation and potential lines of action for a GM; if put in front of the players the map itself becomes a medium of play, in that players begin to orient their actions so that the map changes in their favor.<br/><b>Limitations:</b>  With numerous characters in multiplex relations, they can be quite complex to draw, since the number of potential ties grows geometrically with each additional character added to the map.  They are probably most useful in cases where one has a relatively small and stable cast of characters.                        </div>

<b>The Bag of Rumors</b><br/><br/>I've used this for traditional GM-driven con games and short-shots where I have some setting details that are critical to the scenario, but I don't want to lecture on it.<br/><br/><b>How it's used:</b>  It's like a the random rumor table in a bag.  Get some index cards, write short rumors and factoids on them, along with some information about the NPC that gave them the info and maybe the location that they heard it in.  Do one for each character.  Put them in the bag.  At the start of the session, pass the bag around and have 'em pick.<br/><br/><b>Benefits:</b>  You've just seriously parallelized your information-sharing.  If you've got (n) players, you now have (n) pieces of data and (n) NPCs and (n) locations to work with, very quickly.  Engaged players will be eager to communicate your information.<br/><br/><b>Drawbacks:</b>  Too much information may paralyze a large group that is prone to overanalysis.  (Interesting that parallelize and paralyze sound so similar.)   <br/><br/>I have it in my head to try a more player-centric variant of this, where the players write the rumor cards, and a player is rewarded when they play to the material on the rumor card they've been dealt. Probably do this as a bolt-on to Heroquest or Over the Edge or a similar game with powerful game currency and slender rules.                        </div>

Is this useful beyond hippie games, though? E.g., Gamist D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I think so.  There's a large territory of play between your two end-points, even if you imagine "gamist D&amp;D" to <b>never</b> involve anything more than Doom-like kill 'em and take their stuff fight scenes (like the AP reports that Zak Arntson posted on the Forge in recent months).  I've used character maps in an (abortive) Champions game I ran many years ago, and in a third-edition D&amp;D game as well.  Knowing who knows whom, who likes whom, and who doesn't get along with whom is <i>always</i> useful, and can be a source of trouble for PCs in a traditional game.  Imagine a town where stuff went down like this:  <br/><br/>At the weapons shop:<br/><br/>"Oh ho, I see you are wearing armor that bears the craftmark of my despicable rival, and so though you have spent good money on it I will not sell you this keen and unbreakable sword that you very obviously desire unless you take off the armor and smash it with a hammer."<br/><br/>Buying potions:<br/><br/>"Aren't you the one who smashed the armor my brother sold to you? Sorry, we're out of stock. Come back later."<br/><br/>Now I don't know that that's particularly <i>fun</i>, but it's enabled by knowing who's connected to whom how.  If anything, that's a sim technique.                        </div>

<p>I'm just really not sure that this concept applies at a particularly broad scale. The complexity and diversity of the roleplaying games genre keeps getting obscured or deliberately swept under the rug by metaphors like this, and that's bad for all of us.</p>

                            Yeah.  Shreyas, it's just multiple, not broad scale.  Three games is multiple, if not broad.  In fact one of the things that I'd like to see in this thread is <em>how</em> broad these techniques really are.  I, perhaps like you, suspect that they are actually pretty narrowly applicable in the end.  But we can't make that determination until we're actually talking about actual techniques and tools.  Thus the thread.                        </div>

                            Just me, or are there actually pretty few universal tools in evidence?  I mean, if we're down to "dice" and "face" that seems to be scraping the barrel...                        </div>

                            This isn't a tool that I use, but it's a tool I'm looking for/thinking about.<br/>
<br/>
My current rpg situation limits me to pick-up games almost exclusively right now. What I've been thinking on was some sort of tool, that with a basic idea of the genre, a GM could do a 'reading' (think fortune telling) to set up the situation. Maybe some for npc's as well. Not a pure random adventure generator, just enough to reign in the possibilities down to a couple of aspects/themes for a story. Imagine the plot elements from Vincent Baker's Cheap and Cheesy Fantasy game (or Clinton R. Nixon's Fantasy Oracle), but pull them back so they would fit better in a non/fantasy setting. Some sort of RPG tarot deck.                        </div>

                            JBR, there definitely are a ton of universal tools, but people are listing them haphazardly instead of based on an outline of possible tools.  If you want to really make a detailed list, you need to set forth some guidelines, like:<br/><br/>The Voice<br/>- Accents<br/>- Tone<br/>- Volume<br/>- Singing<br/>- Etc.<br/><br/>The Body<br/>- Positioning<br/>- Gestures<br/>- Movement<br/>- Pantomime<br/>- Etc.<br/><br/>Props<br/>- Notes/Records<br/>- Signifiers<br/>- Resources<br/>- Randomizers<br/>- Etc.                        </div>

                            I was responding to your lament about there "not being many universal tools."  I feel like there are an endless variety of them, but they don't all necessarily have names like "character maps" or "flags" or "kickers" or even "character sheets" or "scene framing" or what have you.  Most of them are stuff we just do, without having a specific name for them.  And if you were to make an attempt to map out all the things people do during play (which my outline above was trying to be an example of how you might start), you could start categorizing behaviors and attaching labels to them.                        </div>

                            First off, I'm with Jonathon: I think there's a heckuva lot of stuff that we practice doing in many role playing games that carries over between games.  But for the most part we don't look at them.  A lot of them relate to how we play-a-role, tell-a-story, make-a-character or make-a-situation.  I don't think it's a coincidence that the NC guys were able to usefully apply Impro to their role playing.  Some one else is already working on these tools.  Like modern sculptors, we should probably be well versed in tools from many disciplines.  <br/><br/>I think it's a mistake, from the point of view of trying to identify tools, to say "voice and dice are the bottom of the barrel."  Voice and dice are like cutting and measuring tools.  You've identified two classes of tools, not two tools.  For instance, you have "accent as characterization," and "tone of voice sets tone of scene" or "dice as randomizers" and "dice as pawn" and "dice as record keeper."
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I'm not so interested in concepts (like flags) so much as actual things that players can do at or away from the table, before or during the game.</blockquote>
On the other hand, this sentence makes me think I'm in the wrong discussion.  I think that that flagging is exactly this kind of tool.  Whether or a not a game makes it's flags explicit, they're still an incredible communication tool.  Even before the concept was identified, DMs everywhere have looked at a party with CHA 4 across the board and re-thought the courtly intrigue plot they'd been planning.  Once you've got a word for it, once you think about it explicitly, you can play harder to the flags other players present you with.  And that's a tool.  <br/><br/>Now, it's also interesting to see flags made explicit in some rules texts.  Foremost because it makes the concept clear, such that you think explicitly about it in other games.  But also because it's an example of useful tools being made key parts of designs, which is, I think, one of the cooler things going on in indie games, and maybe one of the harder things to swallow as well.                        </div>
