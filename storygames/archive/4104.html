He sets off an alarm, and the IC (intrusion countermeasures) come his way. The amount of IC is both limitless and limited. It's limited in that the system can only run so much at a time, but limitless because whenever resources are freed up by destroyed IC, more can be spawned. He has to do what he can and get out, but won't be totally hosed by being surrounded by infinite IC at once.<br/><br/>In the meat world, the IC has scrambled a security team to the hacker's location. Four guys, armed and cautious, arrive. Overall they're a small part of a larger security force, but that force is most definitely limited: there aren't infinite Joes on the payroll. However, you also get to tack on Lone Star's private police forces, and might even warrant a military response if the runners break out their Panther Assault Cannons. While finite, the resources are effectively limited, since escalation can occur until the runners escape or die.<br/><br/>Or there's a Rolemaster campaign at the next tabnle over. The low level PCs have heard of a bunch of orcs trying to make incursions into the Shire for unknown reasons, so they head out from the Prancing Pony to find out what's going on. The band of orcs numbers 23, which is a lot for a low level party to handle unless they're smart, but it's most definitely finite, and there's no help in sight.<br/><br/>In either case, if you try to set some sort of boundaries in the system, you limit the number of situations your game can portray.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91899/#Comment_91899" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T15:56:10+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  3:56PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, unless I'm misreading it you're talking about in-fiction limits.

Rune is designed for hyper-gamist GM-vs-Player dungeon-crawling where there's actually a <b>winner</b> at the end of the adventure, so having opposition be limited not only makes sense but is kinda necessary for the game to work, IMO.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Wushu has no limit on opposition whatsoever, besides the GM not being a dick and, arguably, player Veto. But it is designed for freewheeling action with lot sof player narrations, and so a balanced opposition just isn't important.<br/><br/>Both are cool games, but they do very, very different things.<br/><br/>M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91903/#Comment_91903" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T16:01:58+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  4:01PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also limited: Agon, Beast Hunters.<br/><br/>I think there's a place for each, it really depends on your design goals. In Agon, there's only so much Strife because it sets a limit to the amount of Glory to be won. It allows for winners and losers. In Beast Hunters, the player sets the limit (both pool and maximum expenditure). It's a self-imposed difficulty level, which allows the player to step up by choosing higher limits and facing bigger odds. Both of these are clearly Gamist designs, and the limits work well for that.<br/><br/>In Shock:, when we played it, the limit was primarily more of a story pacing mechanism. And it worked very well as that.<br/><br/>But I can clearly see that many games work better when there is no limit, because each situation can be judged on its own merits, and maybe you don't want to have a pacing built into the mechanics but instead want it to be flowing from the fiction only.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91904/#Comment_91904" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T16:06:04+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  4:06PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2007 4:08PM by Andrew Kenrick.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Unlimited: Burning Wheel</blockquote>\nBut conversely, Burning Empire has quite strict mechanical limits on opposition.<br/><br/>I want to say that neither is better than the other, but I'm not sure that's true. I think having a mechanical limit, or a finite resource, potentially evens the field between player and GM, which might make things fairer but could also make things competitive between them. Alternatively, having no limits potentially reinforces the GM/player divide, as the GM gets to play with a different set of rules. But equally, he is more able to facilitate the story by reacting to players and challenging characters. Maybe ;-)<br/><br/>Would you say that a mechanical limitation has the effect of balancing challenges and conflicts, or can such a balance be struck without the need for a mechanical limit? I'm thinking of the use of strife in Agon (a mechanical limit) vs challenge ratings and encounter levels in DnD (not quite a mechanical limit - the GM can break them if he likes, but the players get rewarded all the same).<br/><br/>Edited to add: I find this topic fascinating, as I've been very much leaning towards the idea of mechanical limits for GMs in my recent game designing. In particular the role of the GM in <a href="http://littlestkobold.livejournal.com/tag/ordinary+angels" rel="nofollow">Ordinary Angels</a> is very much bound by what he can and can't do, with mechanics heavily influenced by the strife mechanics in Agon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91906/#Comment_91906" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T16:08:05+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  4:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think having a mechanical limit, or a finite resource, potentially evens the field between player and GM, which might make things fairer but could also make things competitive between them.</blockquote>\nAnd that's exactly why they work so well in Gamist designs, where the GM can then go all-out in a fair, balanced way <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A" title="Albert A"><img alt="Albert A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://web.mac.com/albertwa/Ryoanji.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albert%20A">Albert A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91907/#Comment_91907" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T16:08:29+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  4:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>In either case, if you try to set some sort of boundaries in the system, you limit the number of situations your game can portray.</blockquote>\nIf you design your game well, you mostly limit the bad situations.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with almost all Unlimited GM resources games (especially games with lots of fiddly bits like, say, <i>Exalted</i> or <i>Weapons of the Gods</i>), is that they only rarely provide useful guidance on how to provide mechanically fit opposition. The GM spends a bunch of time writing up the antagonists and throws them at the PCs, but then usually has to fudge the battle because they ended up being weaker or more powerful than he expected, relative to the players. I'd rather the game designer take responsibility for that.<br/><br/>In more gamist contexts, it is very difficult for the GM to Play Hard when he has unlimited mechanical resources. You inherently have to pull your punches, because you are mechanically vested with the power to instantly quash the players flat (via the Gods, or orbital laser cannons, or whatever Ultimate Power the setting has). I would rather have my resources laid out.<br/><br/>An interesting middle-ground is The Shadow of Yesterday. Theoretically, the Story Guide's mechanical power is infinite, but there are limits to how much he can apply Right Here Right Now. He can throw a bazillion antagonists who are all Grand Masters in the relevant skill at the players... but they can still never roll a result higher than 7, a value that is [theoretically, at least] in reach of the players, at least if they've had time to advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91908/#Comment_91908" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T16:11:28+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  4:11PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Albert A</cite>My biggest problem with almost all Unlimited GM resources games (especially games with lots of fiddly bits like, say,<i>Exalted</i>or<i>Weapons of the Gods</i>), is that they only rarely provide useful guidance on how to provide mechanically fit opposition.</blockquote>\nIn fact this was one of the best bits about DnD 3e - challenge ratings and encounter levels, as flakey and fiddly as they were, were a fantastic guide for the GM. No more guessing what PCs could cope with - the DMG was very explicit about balancing encounters and appropriate challenges.

Having finite resources for the GM (or other antagonist player) certainly <i>lends itself</i> to gamist design.  It's just easier to compete when the playing field is even.  On the other hand, I don't really believe the reverse is true; that unlimited resources lend themselves to non-gamist facilitating designs, or that finite resources can't work outside a gamist context.<br/><br/>Personally, I just recently realized that gone in entirely the wrong direction on this very issue in my own design.  One day i just looked at the thing and saw that it was encouraging behavior that I didn't want the game to have.  So, back to the drawing board.  So ask yourself, what benefit do you think your game can gain from these two options?  What sort of things do you want to encourage/discourage?<br/><br/>Oh, and lest I forget:  Every bit as important is the question of whether the players will have limited or unlimited resources, for exactly the same reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92074/#Comment_92074" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T07:52:01+00:00" title="August 31, 2007  7:52AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Albert A</cite><cite>Posted By: James McMurray</cite>Yeah, I meant in the game.

If, for instance, you're just trying to tell a story or provide a challenge, then many of those extra cops or guards are likely to be just "color" that never hit for any damage and go down with one hit (possibly without even wasting any "actions" to do so).  The limited antagonism would be reserved for certain key elements of the scene that exemplify dramatic bits or particularly interesting challenges.<br/><br/>That said, for the "pocket world" goal, unlimited is probably best (as a default, at least) since the game is constrained by the "in-fiction" limits instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray" title="James McMurray"><img alt="James McMurray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20McMurray">James McMurray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92209/#Comment_92209" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T11:08:30+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 11:08AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I'm definitely in the camp that likes for the players' opponents to be more than just color that can never hit for any damage.

If you trust your GM not to screw you over, railroad you, overwhelm you without reason, etc. then unlimited is great. If you don't trust them, whether it's warranted or not, having some limits in place is probably better. Trust probably isn't the only issue, but it's the one that leaps right out at me, and I can't think of anything else which would require that the system limit the GM.<br/><br/>Well, almost nothing else. As someone earlier mentioned, competitive play where you're looking to score points and find a winner at the end of the night definitely needs some limits. Trust could also work here, but "give me ultimate power so I can win the game" is a much harder pill to swallow than "give me ultimate power so we can all have fun."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

If you decide to stroll into the donut shop across from the FBI office and rob it, having there be 14 off duty agents with hidden sidearms is a possibility.

One million D&amp;D players can't be wrong (and I think some people around here often overlook that). My own play experiences show that unlimited GM power can still yield amazing game play. Having unlimited GM powers <i>forces</i> the GM to act ultimately benevolently toward the PCs. It puts the GM in the role of a facilitator, trying to bring out the fun. For skilled GMs with a particular mindset (see below), this is a perfectly reasonable play style. Limited resources, while not necessarily forcing, certainly encourages an adversarial role.\n<blockquote>Also, can anyone else come up with some good arguments in favor of unlimited opposition? Maybe someone who particularly enjoys and really groks on a deep level some of the unlimited games like SOTC and BW?</blockquote>\nIn many ways, this is the same issue with players and the game's intended play style. I mean: There are some GMs that don't feel comfortable sitting in the role of an adversary to the players (or, at least, feel less comfortable). For them, assuming their ability to GM each is at least equal, an unlimited opposition game is, categorically, a better game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

For example, if you know the GM is only allowed 15 "challenge points" per night (or whatever), then once 11 have gone past, you can assume there's probably a climax coming where the GM uses his last 3 or 4 points. This doesn't even have to be some sort of malicious metagaming, some people (especially meticulous GMs moonlighting as players) do this sort of thing practically in their sleep. If you've got unlimited oppositions you're forced to pay attention to what logically can occur in the in-game situation because there are no out-of-game clues to let you know when the final encounter is due.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

The question itself  asked my experience with limited opposition. I thought perhaps an underlying layer to it was asking about my experiences in general.

If you really want to discuss it I will, but the point was that X amount of opposition can be either dickery or logical, depending on the situation.

Just because the mechanical opposition doesn't "logically" mesh with the fiction, doesn't make it "dickery".  The rules can do more than simply simulate fictional physics.

Despite really, really wanting to, I haven't played it, but here's what I get from my understanding of the rules.<br/><br/>First of all, obviously the GM is going to try to balance the opposition for the most part, and that's probably enough much of the time.  Secondly, there's the "Let it Ride" rule where one success is good for all similar opposition in that scene.  Throwing more guards at the sneaking players won't make a difference if they've already succeeded.  Third, while success is better, BW failure usually isn't career-ending, even in combat.  Fourth, "excessive" challenges are a necessary part of advancement, and are looked upon as an opportunity (sometimes even requested!)  Fifth, mechanical rewards are for being in conflicts, not just for winning them, so "losing" is only a loss in the fiction (or at least doesn't sting as much).<br/><br/>So, the conclusion that I'm coming to is that unlimited opposition is only a problem in a gamist environment, where "losing" removes or diminishes your ability to play.<br/><br/>I think that makes sense.<br/><br/>I believe the same could be said of Spirit of the Century.  Death is unlikely and trouble is mechanically rewarded.

E.g. players try X, the GM assigns infinite opposition, implying automatic failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo infinite opposition is good whenever you think someone having veto power is good. We've identified one such case - when you want someone around to defend genre conventions or internal story logic. (To use the rob the donut shop across the way from the police station example, the players suggest "We rob the coffee shop and succeed" A GM who puts in an insurmountable number of mechanically high-powered entities in the shop is implicitly responding "Veto - out of genre. We are trying to emulate a realistic setting and we have established that your characters do not have the capability of doing that") Another case is when one player was expected to do alot of pre-game work, and needs a tool to defend his prep-work from being made irrelevant (without such a tool, that person won't have the incentive to do the prep-work). So if you expect classical GMs to have highly preped settings and stories, it helps to give them veto powers related to those. If you expect players to develop highly complex PCs, it helps to give players veto powers related to permanent changes in those PCs. (Conversely, if you WANT to DISCOURAGE prep-work, because it may interfere with free-wheeling creation at the table, then you might not want players with veto powers during play) Another possibility is when there is massive difference in player skill or motivation. Basically, if you WANT one player to be dominant, give them the tools to be dominant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs has been discussed, you can also temper the power-balancing impact of veto's by giving everyone the authority to veto. So if you want, say, the genre-enforcing effects of veto power, but not the power-balance ones, give veto authority to everyone (like Wushu, or arguably Polaris)<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, on a specific point of finite opposition leading to metagame realizations (which CAN be a bad thing - I think the point of this discussion is to identify when things CAN be bad, not when they need be always bad), this can be tempered by systems that have a reset-clause. For example, in PTA budget refers to an episode - not a session. You can have one episode last two-sessions, or two-episodes in a session. So if the producer thinks he's running low on budget, he can end the episode, refresh the budget AND refresh the player's resources. What finite budget does is prevent the GM from forcing the players from spending all their resources, and then the GM gaining eventual de facto control of the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also point out that even if you are kinda ambivalent about shared authority and the like as I am, I have found that limited GM resource pools really do help with general game logistics. It just makes life easier if you don't have to worry about creating balanced encounters. I'm quite happy to let the system take care of that, so I can focus my energy elsewhere as a GM, even in a mostly "traditional" framework.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
