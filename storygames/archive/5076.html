That is a tough one.  Some DitV players may disagree with me, but I think what makes it tough is that it lines up with the escallation process.  Anything about learning not to shoot, when to talk, when to walk away, or anything of that sort trigger the same thing in my brain.  <br/><br/>The first trick to use is to remind yourself, and your players, that escallating to fighting in these situations is not the same as loosing.  If the player says that they want their character to learn when not to fight, and they escallate to fighting in that conflict, they can still win that conflict.  If the character wins the conflict by beating everyone bloody, then they can still self reflect and say "That was the right time to get violent".  Does that make sense?<br/><br/>When the first trick isn't doing it for you, the second trick is to try to help the player re-frame their initiation conflict so that it doesn't get trumped by escallation.  If the player asks for "I want my character to learn when not to fight" you can counter-suggest something like "How about if your character learns how terrible the consequences are when they fight for no good reason?" or "How about if your character learns not to fight without good reason?"<br/><br/>Which would result in the two awesome traits of "I fight for no reason." and "I only fight for good reasons".<br/><br/>How's that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114675/#Comment_114675" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-16T18:29:50+00:00" title="December 16, 2007  6:29PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2007 6:49PM by Eldir.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Learning when to quit fighting sounds like an internal change kind of initiation, so I think that would mean the opponent in the initiation is the impetus to change, while the character is the force against change. In that case, the character's escalating and winning would result in the trait 'I don't know when to quit fighting' while losing (with or without escalation) would result in the 'I learned when to quit the fight' trait. This also has the interesting effect of making personal changes harder during initiation than external tasks. <br/><br/>So with that particular achievement, the situation might be something like arresting hardened criminals, with the stake being bringing them to justice. PC wins, the criminals are dead and PC gains the trait 'doesn't know when to quit.' GM wins, they're brought in and PC gains the trait 'I learned when to quit.' The bad guys could even be out of the Conflict equation altogether, the PC could instead be rolling against a level-headed NPC partner, with the Raises and Sees going something like this. <br/><br/>PC (Raise): I keep my rifle trained where they've holed up, to shoot the moment I see movement. <br/>GM (See): Brother John grabs your arm.  "What do you think you're doing?"<br/>GM (Raise): "We're supposed to bring them in, not kill them! Let's talk to them, they should know by now they've lost."<br/>PC (See): I shake John's hand off. "I don't care."<br/><br/>And so on...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114695/#Comment_114695" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-16T23:28:21+00:00" title="December 16, 2007 11:28PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2007 11:30PM by noclue.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I was GM and the player wanted their Dog to learn when to quit fighting, then I would have the player play the PC trying to learn.  I would play them not wanting to change and resisting that learning. Then I would frame a scene in which they were ridiculed by a large group of older boys. The nice thing is that it really doesn't matter how the argument ends up because the stakes are "Do I learn when to quit fighting?" not "Do I beat them up?" If I win the stakes, then they take a trait like "I don't know when to quit" or "My temper always gets the best of me." If they win the stakes, they can take a trait along the lines of "I know when to stop." Their sees can be things like saying "I don't want to fight you any more" or "Alright, I've had enough now." Even if we narrate the Dog beaten and bruised and unconscious, they can still claim a moral victory for not fighting unnecessarily or trying to stop fighting. If I win the stakes, then whether they are lying unconscious or standing over the broken bodies of their attackers, they still get a "don't know when to quit" trait. Even if they pull a gun and kill them all the Dog can still claim that they learned that that wasn't the time to quit fighting and take their trait if they win.

Sometimes you can help make it a simple declarative sentence, which is easier.  <br/><br/><i>I learned when to quit fightin' </i>sounds good to me.  I guess I'd take a minute to look at that statement and find the most important part, which, to me, is the word "when".  So set up a conflict in medias res, where it's easy and tempting to go too far - maybe lay out an ugly rivalry with raises and sees across the training period, with lots of temptation to escalate beyond what is reasonable and prudent.  Make the rival an absolute asshole, raise with the instructor's stern warnings, that sort of thing.  Let him turn the other cheek until he runs out of dice.<br/><br/>Last night I played a guy with "I'm a liar" as a trait, and my initiatory conflict was whether or not I could tell the truth if I had to.  I won and got "I'm not a liar" as a second trait.

It just means you take a bucket of fallout, and are quite possibly dying, which isn't great. But if you Give (instead of Raising), then you retain your high die for use in any followup conflict (such as the medical attention one you may well need to win)<br><br>The rules on p90 of my rulebook:\n<blockquote><cite>Dogs in the Vineyard</cite>What\u2019s at stake is: does my character kill yours? It\u2019s possible for you to lose the conflict without taking any Fallout a\u2019tall, let alone rolling a 16+.<br><br>When that happens, treat it exactly as though your attacker hit you with four dice Fallout, of the size appropriate to his weapon \u2014 d10s for a gun, d8s for an axe, etc. \u2014 and you rolled a 16. If you get medical attention, we roll over into this new conflict: are you dead? If you don\u2019t, we don\u2019t: you\u2019re just dead.</br></br></blockquote> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114924/#Comment_114924" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T04:24:19+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  4:24AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Warren, <br><br/>Yup, I was just reading this last night in the rules.

In play, generally, players initiate the conflict, they have to understand and accept the consequences of succeeding or failing, and it is, generally, a question being asked that the answer is unknown.<br/>\n  Hope this point of view helps...<br/>\nDave M<br/>\nAuthor of Legends of Lanasia (Still in Beta)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115132/#Comment_115132" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T14:00:27+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  2:00PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, <br/><br/>Can you elaborate on step 3?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
