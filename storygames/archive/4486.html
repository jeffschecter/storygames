Various mechanical include but are not limited to pool switching, pool point destruction, activation or neutralization of secrets, and the trusty creation of elemental matter\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/><br/>b) a magical language you learn by way of secrets (Zu, as you noted) and pseudo-secrets, that give out bonus or penalty dice and can create fully-formed things and/or beings.<br/><br/>c) drugs, potions and poisons that can be produced through skill use and improved by a special skill and abilities (Ammenite alchemy)<br/><br/>d) A secret that conveys abilities (Moon silver) and is fettered by  secret(s) (Moon Heart or what's it called)<br/><br/>e) A skill that opens up passages to another world<br/><br/>NB: d and e are exclusive to each other to a point. This is also a fun mechanic as you have to decide for the cool witchblade like power or the cool otherwordly place eventually.<br/><br/>f) Secrets that change what you can use mundane skills for (Qek spirit magics)<br/><br/>g) Secrets that change usage of certain skills (magical craftwork)<br/><br/>In addition to that, most magical effects can be handled mechanically by the core Secrets Clinton recently identified on this board <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4257&amp;page=2#Item_4" rel="nofollow">(see here)</a> ("Use Secret of Imbuement for almost everything, and the Secrets of Blessing, Enhancement, and Specialty for everything else."). <br/><br/>More important than the mechanics is the relation to the game world. Three Corner Magic is not cool because you roll a dice to get an effect, it's because it's a hermetic philosophy that tries to explain and change the world all at once, and is possibly tied to the great climax that almost destroyed everything. Zu is cool because it's a language  anyone can learn, and by using it you make a statement about your responsibility for the world. Moon Silver is cool because it is alien to Near and you can form it with your mind alone; the green world is full of history and past \xe2\u20ac\u201c a perfect match to the fleeting, ever changing nature of Moon Silver. Alchemy is the bad ass stuff the ammenites use and enjoy, even if they're not trying to kill someone; and Qek spirit magic is the foundation for an ever growing mass of zombie encounters and out of body experiences. <br/><br/>On the Forge, Eero Tuovinen once showed that the magical nature of an act can also be no more \xe2\u20ac\u201c or no less \xe2\u20ac\u201c than <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23198.0" rel="nofollow">a key</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101632/#Comment_101632" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-08T06:55:31+00:00" title="October  8, 2007  6:55AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fine work there, Oliof.

They're terrifically fun to write, and one of the settings has a couple of types of magic. One of the systems I was thinking about will have prerequisite <i>Keys</i>, broadly encouraging certain behavior in the magician.

You can then expend that pool to do things appropriate to your culture. So an astrologer, for example, makes a reading on a person or event, which fills up their astrology pool. They can then spend those points to reveal facts about their reading, influence events, and that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Brandon (Judaicdiablo) is primarily in charge of this part of the design, and he has done some really amazing things with the TSOY system.<br/><br/>Coffeestain: we've been experimenting with temporary keys too. We're trying a system where you can put a temporary key on someone and compell them to an action. If they decline, you get a bonus die in compensation. I'm not sure this is exactly the right way to go. If you get a system that you like, let me know!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
