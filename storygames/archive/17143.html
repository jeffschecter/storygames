I know there exists games that use simple range/movement systems like MECHA and Agon. Those sorts of suggestions would also be helpful.<br/><br/>To give folks an idea as to what I'm doing... There exists a Battle Board that is divided into 13 zones arrayed to look like a FF style crystal (this idea was taken directly from MECHA). Combatants move across these zones like how you'd expect in a SRPG, differing attacks have different ranges. Each zone is randomly given an Element by picking a bead out of a bag. Each bead is labeled 1 ~ 3. That level is applied to a specific zone by rolling a die. Monsters use/eat the levels to activate special effects, PCs gather the levels to cast spells and activate special powers.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389066/#Comment_389066" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-02T21:35:10+00:00" title="September  2, 2012  9:35PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ancient Oddyseys: Treasure Awaits! and Old School Hack come to mind as games that use deliberately abstract "zones" during combat.

It wouldn't work for my game but I still like it a lot.<br/><br/>OSH, FATE and Spellbound Kingdoms use zones for movement. Some of the best games for tactical movement that doesn't force you to break it down into too much unnecessary details.<br/><br/>This is the 1st Battle Board to be used with playtesting. I plan on creating different patterns later on. Part of me thinks it would be fun to lay down colored sticks or something across the zone barriers to represent hindering terrain or obstacles.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i50.tinypic.com/2hpoaqt.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389104/#Comment_389104" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-03T10:40:25+00:00" title="September  3, 2012 10:40AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2012 10:40AM by zircher.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, that pretty describes a geometric version of Diaspora's area driven man-to-man mini-game.

You have one or more designated starting points, and then every time you act you move a space through the "map", performing different attacks along the way.  Typically the most effective or devastating moves are several nodes deep, and have several paths to get there, and many moves have map-affecting properties like resetting you to the start position after use, or resetting someone else to theirs.  <br/><br/>Ryuutama (coming in English in the future) has a battle system almost literally taken from a JRPG, Final Fantasy 1 to be specific; the extremely abstract combat map is baddies on one side, PCs on the other, with a front and back row per side.  Characters in the back row can't be attacked by enemies in the front row, but back row characters with bows can attack front row characters.  Characters can move between their rows, but that's the extent of the tactical movement.  If there are no characters in a given front row, all the back row characters are now in the front row.  If you've ever played a pre-polygon Final Fantasy, this should be very familiar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389683/#Comment_389683" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T10:34:21+00:00" title="September  9, 2012 10:34AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a big fan of SK and its combat system!

Your general health going into the fight (your "condition", a separate value from the actual persistent HP count) also determines how much physical damage you can take before dying, so there's definitely room for circumstances to make fights distinct.<br/><br/>I have <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/336494#Comment_336494" rel="nofollow">a longish AP here</a> if you haven't seen it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390008/#Comment_390008" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T07:13:56+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  7:13AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was frothing at the mouth so long for TBZ and now all I can think about is Ryuutama. :P Thank you for the AP!!!<br/><br/>I've decided, interestingly enough considering my previous comments in the thread, to marry my combat system with most of OSH's system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
