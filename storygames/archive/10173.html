Surely I'm not the only one?).<br/><br/>Is there any convention here for designating a thread as "serious" or otherwise tagging it with "please don't come into this thread with nothing to add but your cock?" Maybe a new sub-forum called "But Seriously, Folks" or similar?<br/><br/>I think it is a BIT of an issue, at times, because folks who might have otherwise participated (or worse, already contributed) to a serious discussion become (a) frustrated, (b) disgusted, (c) insulted, or (d) some combination thereof. They leave, the thread gyres for a bit while the jokes peter out (no pun intended), and an otherwise potentially valuable exchange dies out.<br/><br/>On a more general level, is there any provision for actually moderating a thread, by the OP?

When everyone is very uprightly defending their upright stances with upright dignity and upright identity politics and upright status games the conversation becomes very quickly very stupid. <br/><br/>Of course, taking the piss out in that way is an artform, so Gang aft agley and all that. <br/><br/>Other times its an expression of annoyance, contempt, poor impulse control, a matter of status playing, pointing out that this has all been talked about before and its fucking frustrating to have the same conversation again with no progress, just being a bitch, or doing one of the many other things folks do in real conversations all the time. <br/><br/>The thing about it is that in real conversations when it happens there is all this body language that sorts out where you go from there, and what it meant, and why. Online none of that is there, so everyone keeps talking to the ghosts in their own head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225810/#Comment_225810" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-19T11:09:07+00:00" title="August 19, 2009 11:09AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty much what Brand said.

To unpack:<br/>* All jokes are equal--a tossed-out, one-line cock comment is as disruptive (or not) as a slight pun made by way of introducing a larger point.<br/>* All subject on this forum are trivial, at their core--sure, we might SOMETIMES care, but no one has the right to give a fuck about any of this, especially when (for instance) their identity, image, personality, or even revenue model is mocked or threatened.<br/><br/>I just don't really agree. And I can give one, solid, salient example of the failure: I routinely ignore threads here in which I was very interested, because the signal to noise ratio reaches a screech and I wonder why I should even bother. ROUTINELY.

I don't think anyone here is worthy of being Ignored totally. (And I recall how to do it, Brand.)<br/><br/>I think the notion of "reason to respect" is also valid, Ryan... but, again, only to a degree. Simply being a human being warrants a great deal of respect, and merely being stern (or even defending oneself with more force than the attacker) does NOT warrant future disrespect.<br/><br/>SO, since this is now about me (and not the subject line, anymore), I'll readily concede that I can be very abrasive--two eyes for an eye, I always say. I will argue (and ask for counter examples, please) that I only do so upon provocation, the very sort of provocation I am trying to ask for a flag to say, "Not Here, Please" to avoid... which would, in turn, preclude any reason for me to counterattack.<br/><br/>But I can't recall a single time that I have intentionally targeted some individual, here or on other forums, for abuse or mockery. I wish I could say the same is true in reverse (I point to this thread as the most recent example). I take the issues surrounding this industry very seriously, as I hope to transition into it in some sort of full time, career capacity (and in this matter, perhaps I <i>am</i> WAY off the track, in terms of appropriate forums). But I'm obviously not exclusively serious; and I have probably done the very thing I am trying to preclude, in other threads, without thinking--I'd like to think that if someone said, "Dave, please contribute something salient" I would have tried... or left the thread alone.<br/><br/>Anyway...

Tell people what you want to get out of it and keep things on track if necessary.  I do that all the time and people are generally very nice about it.</blockquote>\nProtip: THIS WORKS.<br/><br/><b>HOW PEOPLE REACT TO STUFF THAT MAKES THEM UPSET</b>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>What I mean is that the times when we aren't reasonably dealing with each other as human beings aren't just (or even in the majority) the posts about my cock. They're posts that look like real posts, that deal with the subject matter, but do so in ways that are insulting, talking around people, making status plays, playing identity politics, and otherwise being a fuckwit.<br/><br/>So when we talk about why folks (say me, I've got a problem with it, which you've sometimes called me on in the past) flame up and get snide, we might want to also talk about the other kind of snide, stupid, non-contributive posts -- the ones that look like real communication but aren't.</blockquote>\nand\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>Secondly, my point was that you shouldn't mistake humor for disinterest.</blockquote>\nThe other alternative is <i>getting really angry ("internet angry"), being abusive calling them names, and threatening them with physical violence.</i><br/><br/>As a moderator, and more importantly as a member, I far prefer to see the former than the latter.<br/><br/><b>HOW PEOPLE GET TREATED, IN KIND</b><br/>(re: How would things have gone if I requested people get on track: Not well)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Only if you give people a reason to either respect or disregard you.<br/><br/>This is partly about conduct.

There have been so many discussions I wanted to be part of but as I read on, it just dissolved into flames, wild cock lashing, and chest thumping.  So instead of posting I just walked away and went to my knitting or forensic forums.  (There is very little to no cock there but also very little to know gaming disucssion so whatcha gonna do?)<br/><br/>Has no one ever thought of that?  There may be times you don't have to add someone to your ignore list.  Just ignore their posts in real life.  It's not that difficult.  I ignored this forum and many others for at least a year.  I only recently started coming back because Eric mentioned things I might be interested in reading/discussing.  <br/><br/>I also agree with Andy.  Moderate your own thread.

The thing I love about this place is that usually the first few days of posts stick on the front page, so you have *days* to respond to something. If the discussion moves on yet you have something to say even a few hours or days later, feel free to post it! No one's going to shut you up simply because people were tugging the discussion around left and right in the few hours since you last posted. There's more and more people joining the forums every day, which admittedly means more activity, more of a fast pace in discussion, and more threads scrolling faster, but I want to emphasize that a discussion here is only done when you decide to stop posting to it. If you have something more to say, say it! <br/><br/>For all I love RPGNet (and I do love it!), there definitely is a feel of "You gotta post quickly, or the conversation will be over and the thread on the third page back by the end of the day". Luckily, we don't have that here yet.<br/><br/>And if things start moving too quickly, I'll look into forum software or changes that will keep things 'slow' again.<br/><br/>-Andy

None of the other forums I'm on has problems with making jokes and it's often encouraged or just how things go. You can't really derail or distract from discussions, you just quote the bits of the discussion you want to reply to, reply to it, and keep going.

It will sometimes happen that someone will post to a thread a week after its no longer hot and it'll get responses, but it seems that more often it'll garner a few desultory half replies and then drop off again. (The status of the poster and the coherence and punch of the post can mitigate this, but... egh.) <br/><br/>Which isn't a problem if you've something you want to say and nothing else. You've said it, you've (maybe) been heard. Yay! But if you actually wanted to be part of the intense creative/annoying/provoking/confounding heat that goes on in the middle of a good discussion... well, no you won't ever get that.

It's not RPG.net, but we do have some "drop it while its hot" going on. We're a bit to stream of consciousness not to.

If you leave a thread a few hours, it's progressed so far that it's impossible to join in. Threads jump from 1 to 30 posts, very, very quickly.<br/><br/>Also, there's a quickfire posting style. Someone says something, someone else replies too quickly, the first person fires a quick reply back. So there's back-and-forth quibbling arguments. It makes for a low signal-to-noise ratio.<br/><br/>There are also the ad hominem attacks. They're a new thing. I don't always agree with David, but I really feel for him in this thread.<br/><br/>Personally, having several discussions in one thread drives me mad.

I often ignore the forums for the most part on busy work days (which is often) and catch up late in the day or at night. If I see a thread jump from Nothing to 30-50 posts in a matter of hours, I know that it's probably either got lolcats or flamey stuff in it. Happens few and far between *historically*, but maybe we've been seeing a bunch lately? Something to keep an eye on, anyway.<br/><br/>If it's a genuine discussion that builds up that fast, (and this is just personally me here, I'm not setting behavior or asking others to do the same) I usually have no issues with skimming through it (if it's interesting, or ignoring it if it's not), and if there's anything I have left to say after reading what other people wrote, I've got no problem posting later. I've even marked threads to respond to, and followed up on them 1-4 days (or a week) later. Sometimes the discussion continues. It's all pretty fluid, though, but yeah I definitely hear your concerns.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>There are also the ad hominem attacks.</blockquote>\nThey're new, but they're unique to these particular situations I think. I haven't really seen them outside these kinds of threads. I'll follow up in a whisper.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Personally, having several discussions in one thread drives me mad. I wish people would split threads.</blockquote>\nFor this: I absolutely want people to feel free to ask people to split the discussion into a new thread. Here's the thing, though: Some people use the "Please talk about that in another thread" to shut down a conversation altogether, I've seen it before. What I would encourage is this:<br/><br/>0) Don't call out one tangential post as a side topic, only call it out if you see a totally parallel discussion going on that seems to be affecting the main discussion.*<br/>1) Not be a dick about it ("Take that discussion elsewhere").<br/>2) Specifically refer to the now-tangential thread that you see that you feel:<br/>A) Does not belong in the discussion, and<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Think that deserves its own thread.<br/>People might not see a tangent in the same way you do: Calling out specifically the item that is a seperate discussion lets people see what you're seeing easier.<br/>3) Perhaps (tho not always needed) go as far as to create the new thread for that discussion yourself: Post the last 1-2 points into the first post, and ask folks to continue, then link that discussion into the original thread. I've seen both you and Jason do this before, and it's been successful I think.<br/><br/>The above is... let's call it "semi-official". Not going to be written in stone (yet), but I want people to recognize that if they (as discussion participants) ask politely and constructively for people to take a directed tangential discussion to a new thread, those people should go ahead and be polite and do so.

There are times I'm part of the discussion and just as many times I am "ignored." <br/><br/>I don't have a solution, but I understand where David is coming from. There has to be a way you can say "I'd like to talk about this seriously" without someone posting the LOL cat or having people purposefully troll the thread to get a reaction. And admit it or not, there are people on SG who get off on pissing other people off. Not all the time, but I've read enough threads here to point to half a dozen posters who know exactly when they are trying to bait someone while saying "im just joking, you are being too serious here." There are game designers on SG who I am sure are great people in real life, but I won't get near their games because of how they come off on these boards. <br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226224/#Comment_226224" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T09:55:36+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  9:55AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>There has to be a way you can say "I'd like to talk about this seriously" without someone posting the LOL cat or having people purposefully troll the thread to get a reaction.</blockquote>\nI think that simply saying the above in your thread will be enough to earnestly keep the discussion going in that direction. With the following caveats and points of clarification:<br/><br/>1) That you have a history of not shitting on other people's threads. Forum dwellers can smell hypocrisy like sharks do blood.<br/>--And you can overcome such a history, if you make an effort to recognize and change your own behavior.<br/>--It's not a rule or anything, it just an observation of an Action and Reaction that happens in general on forums, even here.<br/><br/>2) If you do so - that is, request that a discussion stay serious or that people stop derailing it with cock/Japan/lolcats - (and I haven't seen many such threads, so we can't simply issue a self-defeating "Oh, but this would NEVER work!" without actually trying it), and someone starts acting up in it, Whisper me! I'll take action, ranging from a simple "I'll keep an eye on it" up to "I'll post a reaction in the thread". Seriously, I'm committed to having your back if you want to steer the direction/focus of your thread.<br/><br/>3) That the Serious Discussion is not about something unrelated to gaming. Namely politics (left vs right, etc). If you say "I want to have a Serious Discussion", and your discussion is about something entirely both flamey and unrelated to gaming ("I can't abide by the politically conservative/liberal stance of posters here! Let's discuss this Seriously!"), I will most likely sabotage or close your discussion.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wrshamilton" title="wrshamilton"><img alt="wrshamilton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wrshamilton">wrshamilton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226225/#Comment_226225" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T09:56:21+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  9:56AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            that internet high-five wasn't meant for me but i took it anyway<br/>\n<br/>\nfelt good                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226228/#Comment_226228" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T10:00:39+00:00" title="August 20, 2009 10:00AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, I agree with your points.

The first round of replies were admittedly playing off of the Irony of the topic, which honestly is a kind of humor I otherwise adore. :-)  But yeah, two sides of the coin; on one hand it's a funny, ironic reply: On the other hand, it's kinda disrespecting the OP.
