Yes<br/><br/>Description: The Princes' Kingdom is a game in which you and your friends act out the adventures of children in faraway lands. These lands are all across an ancient ocean, and are all ruled by a wise king. You play the king's children, princes and princesses, sent out to explore the kingdom and help out the citizens. The kingdom is very large, made up of hundreds of islands, and so the king sends out his princes to survey it and find out what sort of problems people have across the lands, so that they may one day be wise rulers themselves. This is a young player event with the age recommendations between aprox. ~ 8-12 yrs old. Adults/Parents are welcome but should be accompanied by a child!</i><br/><br/>If you have some children that have wanted to try a role-playing game, but haven't had the opportunity, this is a wonderful chance to do just that. <br/><br/>Anywho, see ya there!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
