I suppose that if I had to idealize something, then the person whose schedule is always a hassle would be able to consistently arrive on time for a weekly game, the person whose ideas are always difficult for me to grasp would be more easily understood, and the person who's a little less involved in the game would become a little more involved.<br/><br/>I guess it's true: if you like what you've got, you really don't need introspection.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155929/#Comment_155929" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T16:01:42+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  4:01PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want a nice big table in a well lit, well ventilated room with lots of space. I want comforable, but not too comfortable chairs. I want a stereo with a remote control for mood music, if needed. I want healthy snacks like raw veg, nuts, fresh and dried fruit to nibble on. I want a supply of drinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want three other people. Not four. Not five. Three. I want them to be able to commit to one time slot a week. I want them to be enthusiastically engaged with the game. I want them to contribute to the game online, between sessions. I want them to be awake and focused. I want them to be more than willing to participate in the session. I want them ready to bring the you-know-what.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want the session to have a lead-in where we can kick back and watch some appropriate stuff on DVD. I want us to be able to get the socialising chit chat out of the way in time that isn't eating into the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to hear laughter. I want to hear cries of anguish.

Drinks, tasty and unusual snack foods (many of them being fruits and vegetables but with a healthy porportion of dips and cheeses as well) are all to hand. The carpet is spill resistant and a mosaic of crazy colors anyway, so people don't worry too much about it. It probably isn't shag, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people in the room come from all walks of life. Some of them I know, some of them are new. There are youngsters and elders, first-timers and old hands, artists and mechanics, the employable and the eccentric.  Not everyone is here to play the game I have in mind, a few are just here because they're friends or friends of friends or enthusiasts passing through. Some will stay the night if they've come from a long way away and some will leave with rides or on the bus.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple people make pitches for the games they'd like to run. Some people just want to run board games, but can always feel free to wander past and watch the game. Some people want to read comics and books or chat until the mood to game hits them.  But there's enough steady interest to start two or three games in different parts of the wide, comfortable room after half an hour of chat or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm running an on-going game tonight, putting the capping touches on a Prime Time Adventures hack or some other homebrew thing they've graciously allowed me to run. Last week, I say in on a new friend's brilliant re-interpretation of GURPS as a GM-less tour-de-force and the week before we played a so-so but enthusiastically presented Trail of Cthulhu game by a new GM who's beginning to cut her teeth on the hobby.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's plenty of table talk, banter and jokes, pompous speculation and creative input. Players talk about life, job, romance, school, family and whatever else is bothering them or channel it into their games with horrifying results that add a little spice to the evening.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't imagine a particular person or bent of personality, although I would like to see a lot more liberals in the group than I normally run into so I don't feel lonely and outgunned all the time. But some of the gals are power gamers and some of the guys are emersion-obsessed LARPers and they probably all have other groups to go to, but, for now, for this one evening a month, we've got a club that explores and creates.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I guess all the people in the room would be into creating and collaborating, now that I consider it about more.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTry as I might, I just can't imagine any of them as hot women. There'd certainly be a nicely balanced selection of males and females, but not pretty ones. A few might be okay-looking women who sag in weird places or guys with pot bellies and semi-toned arms, but I just cannot fathom the beautiful set at my house. It makes me very uncomfortable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155963/#Comment_155963" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-10T18:08:19+00:00" title="July 10, 2008  6:08PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2008 6:08PM by PaulCzege.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Neil, for me the ideal group is three people beyond myself. Impossibly, the ideal gender mix is 40% female. We play games that last three to eight sessions. All participants are creatively compelled to run games as well as play. We play weekly. At least two of us paint and draw like renaissance masters. The others are merely uncommonly good artists. At least two of us compose and sing with musical genius. The others are just easy, impressive vocalists. No more than two of us have any interest in designing RPGs for publication. And again I'm with Neil, our gaming room is comfortably appointed, but not too comfortable, a living room just large enough for four chairs and end tables. A hand knotted Persian rug, and few other distractions. Certainly no television. An adjoining covered porch of the same size. And an adjoining kitchen with its own table. We rotate cooking duties on game day, socializing about politics, history, art, literature, publishing, the natural sciences and games while food is prepared and shared together. Sometimes we sing together, ballads written in inspiration from our games. If we have music during our gameplay, it is never recorded, always performed live, by us. Our gameplay creates worlds, wars, heroes, villains, events of triumph, events of tragedy, and returns to them again and again always from new perspectives. Only two of us may be designing games, but the others write and conduct operas about our heroic and tragic narratives, record and release popular and epic musical compositions inspired by our histories, and publish lavishly illustrated travelogues of our surreal worlds. And all of us write powerful essays and publish nonfiction on creativity and human value. (We don't do films. We don't do novels.) Our gaming gives us artistic and social confidence, and through expressing this confidence we heal and empower the creativity of others.<br><br>(This is one "dream group" vision I have, and it is the most powerful for me.

I'm actually quite pleased with my current and long-time playing group. The only problem is that we've scattered all over Finland. The mean distance between me and other members in my group is about 200 km (125 miles, and that is with one member living in the same city as me). Add to that jobs and children (complex scheduling) and that just about equals only over the internet sessions lasting about 2 or 3 hours once or twice a month.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my ideal group what receive regular paychecks for playing so that they could leave their day jobs as well as travel allowances.

As well as just-in-time criticism whenever something starts to suck. I don't know about the other senses, from experiences dating back to my high school games maybe air conditioning would be nice <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nCoincidentally, most of these things are the same that I want to experience are the same if I'm thinking about a collaborative theater project group devising a new play.

Going off on a tangent for a bit is fine, and so are jokes, but everyone is quick to get focused back at the game. None of the players acts like a total fool, and everyone is happy being serious about gaming instead of defense mechanisms kicking in forcing things to become silly. Nobody gets pissy when someone in the group wants to do something in the game that they don't want to do; the group more or less has the same outlook on the game and the shared content, and everyone accepts the other players' freedom within the structure of the game. Also, no one is a dick! That's the important part about us all being friends. If people get upset, we can work it out because we all like each other anyway.<br><br>When someone can't make it to the game, they let everyone know well in advance, so we can reschedule or figure out some other game to play. Everyone is not only willing to play new things, but also willing to spend money on RPGs and read/prepare for the game outside of the time we are together. People besides me are willing to run things, games that I like rather than a "kitbashed Exalted/Cyperpunk 2020 homebrew with Fate Aspects grafted on and this dice mechanic I made myself..."<br><br>And really, the group is made up of people who don't self-define as "gamers" or for whom role-playing is a simple hobby instead of a way of life.

The house is immaculately tidy and spacious, with books lining the walls. <br/><br/>As we play, we laugh a lot, but there's periods of silence, too. Everyone listens.

There's maybe a couch but we're mostly lounging on floor cushions. It's cool and dark outside, the window's open, and you can hear the crickets chirping and the night birds calling to each other. We have different snacks every time we get together. There're cool homemade sodas and fruit pies and sometimes grilled meat! We have theme music. We'd probably get together at about nightfall and hang out until the wee hours of morning. It's not always the same group of people\u2014we have a pretty large revolving group of people who're all in the vicinity of my age, and we don't always play the same games because sometimes we want to play Agon and sometimes Polaris. The couch is for when we have a big group and we need to cram a lot of people together so we like snuggle while gaming. If we're not feeling up to gaming, we usually have art projects or something that we bring with us, or we have a movie night. Sometimes we have really thrilling fights with each other and go home white-faced and shaking, but we're still friends and we know how to say sorry.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_156246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156246/#Comment_156246" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-12T16:40:09+00:00" title="July 12, 2008  4:40PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some people who are fun?<br/><br/>I dunno.

It's captured my imagination since then, although reality would likely fall short of my description.<br/><br/>The space is a large room in an opulent home. The room is surrounded by shadowed alcoves, and numerous adjacent rooms have large open doorways. At the center of the room, where the ceiling is higher, is a good-sized square table, dark wood, heavy. Around it are four chairs that remind me of the Austrian Successionists. There will be many, many people in this room, but only four of us at the table. A bright light shines down upon the table, cold and harsh.<br/><br/>When the four of us arrive, we wait elsewhere, in the kitchen perhaps. A snack, refreshments, a chat with the host, who might take our coats. When the party is fully underway, we are ready to begin, and so the four of us will enter the arena and take our places at the table, dressed in our suits and ties. On the table, only some dice, paper, pencils, four glasses and a pitcher of water, nothing more. This is serious business. We have Issues.<br/><br/>All around us, this is no run-of-the-mill, garden variety party. Throughout those shadowed alcoves and open rooms it is leather and latex, needles, rope bondage, domination, suspension, pain and pleasure. If you know, you know; if you don't, that description is enough to guess. Many have come to watch, but it is clear that our table, the central attraction, is something very different.<br/><br/>We four have come here to play Shock: Social Science Fiction, by Joshua A. C. Newman. We are not distracted by our surroundings. Ties may loosen, arms will flail wildly, voices become heated, passionate and raw. But we have come to resolve our issues, to let our stories unfold as they will. Our attention is centered on that gaming table. Around us, the others know the rules. Some will watch, even pull up their own chairs. But not at the table. They do not approach, they do not touch us, they do not speak to us. We play the game as though we are alone, for as many hours as it takes.<br/><br/>When we are done, our stories told, our battles won or lost, it is late. We collect ourselves, shake hands, and exit. A scattered chorus of golf claps can be heard amongst the crowd around us. We collect our coats from the host, and each of us slips out into the cold and starry night, alone with our thoughts.<br/><br/><br/>...yeah. Yeah!

They are enraptured, captivated by what is happening. When their characters are in danger, they gnaw their nails. When another suffers, they cry. When they see a glimmer of hope, they sit upright, their excitement barely contained.<br/><br/>Most important, perhaps: everyone is really happy to see each other, and there is lots of laughter throughout the evening. Sometimes we laugh because someone made a joke; at other times we laugh because someone just said or did something that is so perfect, so shocking, that laughter, through grinning teeth, is the only response we can have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158174/#Comment_158174" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-23T13:30:45+00:00" title="July 23, 2008  1:30PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah.

When people arrive, there is a short period of welcomes and daily talks, but everybody is aware that we came together for joy and tries to set her real-world concerns aside. johnstone, I love the idea of preparing the game room and entering it only when everybody is ready to play. However, we won't have an audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we entered the room, the theme song is playing. It's the same for the whole season, and the music helps everybody to jump into the shared imagination. Even when this song is played during the week in the radio, my blood pressure rises. It serves as an anchor for the whole bunch of emotions, memories, story hooks and character developments we got so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne or two of us are GM today. Next week, these roles may switch. Everybody contributes ideas beyond the scope of their characters, but the GMs invested time before play to come up with plot points, lively environments with rich and deep NSCs, and thus provide the arena for the shared story.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not more than six in total, but since people are busy sometimes, not always all players are present. However, if someone cannot make it, she offers one or more ideas on what her character would do, which do not interfere with the storyline of the others. She contacted the acting GMs for that, and there may even be plot points based on the absence of the character. The other 2-5 players still meet and play. If, however, only 2 or 3 players are present and they feel not like playing in this small cast, they decide to prepare a future episode together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a clear separation between in-game and out-game. Although the scenes may flow freely, beginning and ending of the scene is clearly announced by the GMs based on their always-perfect sense of the story -- although there is a hand-sign for time-out that player use rarely within scenes for emergency out-game annoucements (I love Polaris for this separation!).<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween sessions, we exchange thoughts, ideas, and renarrations via e-mail and collect this stuff in a campaign wiki. These renarrations go beyond telling things that happened at the table. They contain descriptions of inner-character evolvements and one-character scenes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe campaign is structured like a TV series. There was a pilot one-shot, where we tested whether the setting and the characters work for everybody. We decided to play the first season. Each meeting corresponds to an episode. The different GMs may have episode-spanning plot lines, but we still switch between GMs in between these arcs, which gives a nice balance between the characters and their story involvement. It also eases to play with this changing cast of 2-6 players.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the season, we all celebrate the fun we had with a little party, which involves a BBQ, Caipirinhas and a chocolate fountain fondue. Someone took the time to layout the stories from the campaign wiki, and produced a book [1]. Everybody gets a book copy. We all sign our copies and we will enjoy to re-read the best parts of the campaign years later.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we had enough chocolate and Caipis, we brainstorm ideas and finally decide whether we want to start the next season of this campaign (same characters? same players?), revive another campaign, or start with a new pilot.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n[1] We did this once years ago, I just re-read it and its so great to have this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
