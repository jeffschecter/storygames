The only thing I've discovered, and I think this is just me getting lost in the heat of the moment, is that I've neglected the game's mechanics. I hardly ever use Fate, or key phrases (other than, 'that might not be so easy'). I'm not sure why this is happening -- possibly just a lack of familiarity with the game. <br/><br/>It's also occurred to me that unlike many other games, you can play this one without using those mechanics -- you don't have to ask someone to try again, and you don't have to draw a Fate card, and you don't have to add an interlude. These are just things that you can do, if you want, but if you forget them, the game still works.<br/><br/>The session, overall, was some of the most fun I've ever had while gaming. Just totally amping up the creepiness on all fronts, from your horrific Mystery to Joel's murderous robots to my guy's dead wife.

It was all very romantic, if you ignore the fact that the Ghoul ate the chemistry teacher, and one of her dads was blithely sewing her homecoming dress while the other (a coroner) was thinking about assembling a kid brother or sister for her.  If this had been an ongoing game, I would have had a lot of fun with Dr. Gary, especially after he met her new boyfriend.  "You look...familiar, young man..."  The Ghost had a kid brother he watched out for, and what better source for parts for the sibling?

Didn't even read the handouts for Ghost/Echo. Well all had only a single d6 to roll. We did not get extras for dangers. We were not encouraged to add dangers. The GM did not seem to understand how to clarify goals. All feedback to him seemed that we were stupid and missing things.

Eventually we settled on a huge city, sloping down from the noble houses on the peaks of the hills into the slums where the fur-trapper lived.<br/><br/>At that stage, though, I realised I had a little bit of doubt about the set-up and suggested we pull a fifth card.

Turns our Archipelago II is a solid gold car game - I had fate and resolution cards printed out and that was, pretty much, all we needed. Setting up the game I had a clipboard and took notes as we built characters, so we had them but didn't really need to refer to them. Mark was driving and owned the natural world, so Andy and I passed the clipboard back and forth and sketched out a map based on his description. For some reason we didn't use destinies but didn't miss them.<br/><br/>Our game was a tasty fantasy morsel about a pair of isolated villages confronting the return of an ancient evil.

The first night there I played <b>Lords of Waterdeep</b> in Japanese (and won! I think it was I ended up with both The Harpers and Khelben Blackstaff, as any old Forgotten Realms geek knows Khelben is the leader of the Harpers).<br/><br/>A few nights later, I ran a two-round <b>FIASCO</b> game in Japanese for five players as facilitator. It was a blast, they really got into it when we finally found a "FIASCO-Like" media property in Japan that everyone recognized ("<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiji_(manga)" rel="nofollow">Kaiji</a>"). There was a low-level yakuza, a detective who will do any dirty deed to get his man, a shady lawyer, a goth-loli high school student with a kind of dementia, and her brother the grad student in pharmacology who cooks drugs for the yakuza. No one had a happy ending, and everyone loved it. Okada-san (author of Ryuutama, and also works at the cafe) ended up liking it so much he ran it two times in the next week for other local players, and they had a blast.<br/><br/>While the above game was entirely in Japanese, I acted as facilitator so it wasn't as draining on me. I even jumped in to play some minor parts. There was one time that they needed a judge NPC for a courtroom scene: I was not able to participate because I simply don't know "court room words/conversation patterns", but I did manage to get in some Gyakuten Saiban/Ace Attorney jokes.<br/><br/>Before I left, I played <a href="http://www.j-rpg.com/ryuutama" rel="nofollow"><b>Ryuutama</b></a> with the author/designer, including with an illustrator, a women who was playing RPGs for the first time, a children's book illustrator and another IT guy. I played a Noble "from a far away land", a character class recognized in this game to be the absolute most useless but potentially memorable class in the game. It was great fun, and I learned a lot about the game in the process. The new woman had an awesome time. I'm eventually going to break this session down as a play-by-play later on in its own thread. This game also was entirely in Japanese (save me - as a faraway noble, talking entirely in Japanese but saying about five words in pigeon English, including "Beautiful!" "Wonderful!" etc when he was indicating his own land), but since I was one of five players, I wasn't talking the entire time and thus it wasn't really draining. However, I did take all my character sheet notes in English.<br/><br/><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/106430054160848801055/Japan2012" rel="nofollow">Pics from both the above in my Picasaweb album over here</a><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376902/#Comment_376902" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T07:24:40+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  7:24AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            XXXXtreme Street Luge<br/><br/>Rolling Vengeance won the Luge, and the most prestige, as his Perception was very Vin Diesel-like.<br/><br/>My dude, 'Fus, totally tried to make a friend with some dude, 'cause he knew all about the space program and stuff, but he nerded out (using History) and didn't get any good cards.

First game, Anton came close to being dominant by starting in Australia, but left his back door open and David took him out to win. Second game, David started in Australia and won by doing a long run across South Asia, North Africa, and took the final opponent's base in Peru. This was our third game and we'd opened one packet so far, for David winning twice, which gave us [REDACTED].<br/><br/>This time, Anton picked first and took Australia again, I took Japan, David's in South America, and Erin's in North America, so basically it was a rematch of game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. Anton tried to fight me early on, but wasn't getting anywhere, so we agreed on a focus on more productive things. David and Erin battled it out across Central America while I took Europe and Anton took Africa. Still, I didn't start with a continent (Asia is rough), but had more cards due to my faction's special ability. Anton and David started fighting across the Brazil-North Africa divide, stopping each other from getting continent bonuses and keeping me from getting Europe with minor excursions. <br/><br/>Then David took Erin's base in Ontario and both David and I psychically cooperated to force Anton to attack me in Europe (to stop my continent bonus) which gave me the excuse to send an excursion south and take out his base in Australia. Still, I couldn't hold it and Anton came back strong, since David left him holding all of Africa. [The other big part of the game was allowing your opponents to get certain continent bonuses as long as they were almost guaranteed to use them against another opponent.] In the end, David tried a last ditch effort to get a red star (you need 4 to win) by [REDACTED], but failed due to all of the rest of us rolling seven straight 6's when defending with a single troop. By then, Anton had amassed enough cards to buy a red star and enough troops to successful invade Japan for the win.<br/><br/>Now, though, we've placed all the minor cities on the board and got to open our second packet, which gave us [TOP SECRET]. Looking forward to the next game. Erin and I keep getting hosed because we haven't started in control of one of the smaller continents, but the complications that keep getting added to the game are starting to mitigate against that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377201/#Comment_377201" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T14:37:21+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  2:37PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2012 3:07PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A wonderful game of <a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/07/37/" rel="nofollow">Until We Sink</a> last night.<br/><br/>Premise: We're all either natives or holiday guests on a tiny resort island far into the Paciic Ocean, on an island which is slowly but surely sinking into the ocean.<br/><br/>Throughout the first six evenings of conversation, we slowly draw out the simple, quiet caretaker and find out that his entire family, everyone he knows has died and been buried on the island and that he\u2019s never left the island ever. <br/><br/>On the final day, when the island sinks and the survivors are drifting in a boat and waiting for rescue, the caretaker isn\u2019t with us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377211/#Comment_377211" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T15:07:40+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  3:07PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, the pathos!

The second Spanish Armada conquers Britannia but the <i>Gloriana Invicta</i> resistance ("Elizabeth unvanquished") continues the fight for queen and country.<br/><br/>We've already seen that the British heir-in-hiding Prince James was secretly part of the conspiracy that murdered his own younger sister, Princess Matilde, even while keeping up appearances as her loving brother and protector. Jerk! We go back to before she was killed to answer the seemingly simple question "how was she murdered?" The scene is the conspirators plotting to get rid of the princess. It's set in the gardens of a noble who has secretly supports the resistance and has been hiding the prince and princess from the occupying Spaniards.<br/><br/>Folks are picking characters. It's the usual choices: the prince, the noble, the cutthroat who is biding his time as the princess's bodyguard but is really waiting for the order to kill her.<br/><br/>Hmm, this scene seems too easy. So I pick the princess. The scene framer didn't think to ban her. Go ahead and do your plotting right in front of the poor girl you heartless bastards! Kind-hearted Princess Matilde spends the scene strolling through the garden innocently plucking flowers and bringing them to her loving brother and future assassin. Each time she's out of ear-shot the prince and their two-faced host discuss how best to murder her.<br/><br/>And then to really put the icing on the cake-of-pain, we have the princess's protector and secret love-that-cannot-be (and devoted agent of the resistance) wander into the scene and watch unwittingly as she is handed the poison that will kill her. Which isn't so bad, because we already played the scene years later where he uncovers his masters' treachery and exacts brutal revenge with his own hand. Seeing how callous her murder is actually explains why he was/will be so ruthless in the earlier/future scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377691/#Comment_377691" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T23:47:58+00:00" title="May 10, 2012 11:47PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zombie Cinema without zombies at Story Games Seattle.

Everybody on Europa died, creepily represented by the last surviving human holding down the F key on a keyboard as his or her life ended, crying out to the void. The surviving humans landed on Earth as planned, to find themselves in what amounted to a zoo where Guyana used to be, their future unknown and unknowable. One guy, the engineer Beausoliel, stayed in orbit with 60 days of consumables and no hope of anything at the end of it. And as icing on the failcake, they had tipped their hand concerning where they had come from.<br/><br/>One nice thing about this mini-campaign was that it was a little incoherent - we never knew exactly what the machine intelligence wanted, we never understood its motivations, it was genuinely frightening. Some people it killed horribly, some people it co-opted, a few it seemed to avoid. That, layered on the weird atmospheric stuff about ghosts (combined with ghosts in the machine) gave the whole game a menacing air of unpredictability and terror.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377724/#Comment_377724" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T05:40:47+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  5:40AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The surviving humans landed on Earth as planned, to find themselves in what amounted to a zoo where Guyana used to be, their future unknown and unknowable.</blockquote>\nThis sounds like the start of a new campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377725/#Comment_377725" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T05:41:54+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  5:41AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our game of Night's Black Agents, the failure of our two field operatives to get good intel and to identify and deal with two shapeshifting prisoners meant that:<br/>a) when the American general turned up in his helicopter to take the prisoners away, I had to machine gun them in front of the general as they transformed<br/>b) one of the field operatives approached the local Chinese bigwigs thinking that they were opposed to the vampires, only to find out that they are vamps too.<br/><br/>As a result, we've had to 'borrow' a drone and use it to capture a high ranking vampire to show the general and prove they exist, and now there are a lot of pissed of vampires who, if not angry at us, will certainly be gunning for the general.

The stores there no longer want your money, they want your blood.<br/><br/>Our three characters are Bryan, the angst-ridden local musician; Allie, his drummer\u2019s ex-girlfriend and the town slut; and Emma Jean, her sassy, southern grandmother.  Bryan is trying to return a defective mic stand and Emma Jean has dragged her granddaughter to the bathroom \u2013 again \u2013 when a flying bra wraps itself around Allie\u2019s head and tries to shove its straps down her throat like a facehugger.  Then things got weird.  After being attacked by mutated pets, possessed pants, hamburgers with teeth, two versions of the Necronomicon Ex Mortis and the entire actual Sunglasses Hut kiosk, the gang finally gathered together all the ingredients for the Saaamaaa ritual.  They were able to cast its protective circle just before the fountain kraken\u2019s tentacles crushed the life out of them.  The problem was, they were now surrounded by a living wall of tentacle; the ritual kept the kraken out, but it also kept them in.  Unsure of what to do to escape, Bryan borrowed Allie\u2019s smartphone and Googled a spell for tentacles.  Autocorrect read it as \u201cteleportation\u201d and gave him a spell for just that.  The group thought that the best place to teleport would be back in time to before they entered the mall.  The plan worked!  They teleported themselves all the way back to the Cenozoic.  As a giant sloth rumbled by, the cell phone said the last words it ever would: \u201cLo Batt.\u201d                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378059/#Comment_378059" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T06:35:35+00:00" title="May 13, 2012  6:35AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After much insistence from my six year old son, we sat down and played some OD&amp;D for the first time together.

We don't really know what Valdemar found out there on the island, but it seems he was kind of self counscious when he came back. In the last chapter one of the heroes beat the dreaded captain of the Red Riders and got his sword for a price.<br/><br/>We had fun, but that was definitley the unsuccessful playtest of the two. After making some changes I had another go today with other players.<br/><br/>We saw the undefeated gladiator Valkan fleeing the palace guard, ending up in the Lion Garden (which held lions of course) where he fought for his life. Soon a thief showed up only to be spotted by the already alert guards. They soon made their escape to the other side of the river where they could be patched up and have some wine.<br/><br/>After that they fought assassins in the streets of the Floating City (city block built on stilts in the river), young misbehaving nobles who attacked the poor who lived in the cities great graveyard, and finally the Red Cult at their sacrifice ritual in the old catacombs. It turned out that the Masked Whisperer, the cult's mysterious leader, was no one other than the lord of the city \u2013 a city in which only worship of the Nine Dancers was allowed.<br/><br/>After less than two hours of playing (including drawing the map and making characters) we left our heroes as they were fleeing the now burning catacombs.<br/><br/>By Crom, that's what the game is supposed to be like! But what was more important \u2013 rules changes, or the fact that the second set of players were actually sword &amp; sorcery fans? Maybe they were equal parts. I'll revel in the success for a while anyway!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378124/#Comment_378124" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T17:34:06+00:00" title="May 13, 2012  5:34PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2012 7:13AM by Harlequin.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darius, the Witch, has run completely run out of String, has blown all his Tokens, and has taken two Harm and 5 conditions.

On the bottom floor soup is being served, and the patrons have no idea that it consists mostly of failed experiments.  While the people shuffle through, they are scanned and profiled for future... work.<br/><br/>Now Eli and Kali creap down the hallway to a barely open door.  Eli cautiously opens it, remembering her assassin training.  Kali, in another world, proceeds blindly in, staring at the anomolous flesh detector instead.  It beeps more steadily, more loudly as Kali crosses the room.<br/><br/>Eli is paralyzed with fear.  An abomination, unworldly limbs, peeled eyelids, patched together from organic material and things better not talked about, is grinding powders, mixing chemicals, bubbling tubes full of ichor and blood.  It moves to the two of them, and Kali finally looks up to see it.<br/><br/>Hungry, angry, curious to dissect the two women in it's room, it's mouth creaks open with a slow inhale.  Kali interrupts, pulling from the void and the greater darkness beyond and speaks into the creature's mind.  "Your work is too important to notice us."  It's will is strained, it wants to remember, but it cannot.  Back to grinding and mixing it goes, more furious now.  It reaches over Eli as she regains control of her own body.<br/><br/>"It is when there are <i>two</i> that we must worry.  Hurry, let's take what we need and go."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378879/#Comment_378879" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-18T10:30:20+00:00" title="May 18, 2012 10:30AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2012 10:33AM by mease19.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....<br/><br/>Speaking in Ithorian, Koyzoo asks "Appy, would you want someone in our crew to register ownership for you?."<br/><br/>"<span style="font-family: Courier;">WOULD YOU WANT SOMEONE IN OUR CREW TO REGISTER OWNERSHIP FOR YOU?</span>" AAP53 displays on its monitor. <br/><br/>"Hoom, well, I take your point.

His 1st level fighter "Dragon Torcher" (he chose the name) and mommy's elf "Jemra" are facing a troll at a bridge. I told him he needs to roll a 15 to hit the troll. He asks if his dog Bartleby (he chose the name) is helping. I tell him, "Sure, brave little mutt Bartleby is biting at the troll's leg." <br/><br/>He states, "I'll attack the leg, too!"

And, I'm reminding myself "This isn't about your source material or your ideal movie. Watch it."<br/><br/>Two PCs and two NPCs are off to try to rescue someone, and I'm paying attention to who's where, how quickly people are going to the right place, all that.<br/><br/>And the two PCs look at each other and decide that both NPCs are potential recruits for the Kerberos Club. This means they must Be Tested. And, this is a perfect test situation! So, they deliberately let the NPCs get a crucial couple of minutes ahead of them. One of the PCs changed clothing (for perfectly valid reasons) without even the slightest thought of a suggestion forming itself in my brain because it never occurred to me that anyone might do that..<br/><br/>And we are simultaneously totally off my script, which is good (if it ain't, I should be writing novels, not gming) and doing something that means I can use exactly the material from my source that will push on the current plot arcs and Aspects that the players have decided are important. The two NPCs sent ahead are Nowhere To Be Seen -- obviously captured by the enemy, and the players and PCs are hoping the NPCs will rescue themselves because a) they want to be able to induct them into the club with a clear conscience and b) we've realized that one of them, the sex magician, is the best match for the proper young heiress PC (the one who stopped to change her clothes lest she be recognized doing anything unladylike). He's also the lover of the somewhat scandalous shapeshifting PC.<br/><br/>This is totally not where I saw any of this going, especially the "no, we want them to rescue themselves" part. Oh. And, I think I know how to play with that idea such that the PCs don't lose their agency.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379573/#Comment_379573" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T15:53:26+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  3:53PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tonight I played <i>Evolutionens Barn</i> (Swedish cyberpunky game \u2013 think <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> but cleaner and more utopian thanks to the autocratic (and pretty fascist) company SigmaTech that runs the city of Metropolis).

The government opens with 8 dice in Diplomacy to Pyrol's 6 (spoiling a set) with a tirade on the irrelevance of a non-official speaking but is interrupted as Pyrol (Byron taking two dice for his prep and making a new set): Pyrol explains that he has come in the costume of his forefathers to celebrate the history and the reverence of convention that has apparently been forgotten. An eloquent speech proceeds (Pyrol uses his burn scar as well to point out his sacrifice at the hands of the college) and two hits on the government's essence are incurred. The government is in trouble!<br/>\n<br/>\nPyrol sticks with Diplomacy and the government throws 6 dice with Subterfuge in an attempt to turn this into an assassination of Pyrol. If they score any hits at all, the context will change to Violence. Pyrol notices an enemy agent sidling up to him and, still extolling the virtues of keeping the interests of the common man, sweeps aside the assassin's knife with his walking stick (2d) and exposes the government's desperate attempt at violence. The government takes a hit on Essence and is defeated \u2014 the Scotsman calls for a vote of non-confidence and advises Pyrol to get somewhere safe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380142/#Comment_380142" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-29T20:18:45+00:00" title="May 29, 2012  8:18PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Into the Odd old-school gaming.

She spies a lake far away with a small island. While she wonders what it would be like to visit the island, a huge bird offers to fly Anna to the island.<br/><br/>The flight over is amazing as she views the world from high up. But once on the island, she misses her mother and imagines her calling for her to come come. She looks forlornly at the patient and dutiful bird, who carries her home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_380346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380346/#Comment_380346" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T12:05:47+00:00" title="May 31, 2012 12:05PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Risk: Legacy, games <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> &amp; <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a></b> [minor spoilers, but I've deleted anything not written about in the initial rulebook]<br/><br/>After game three we got both Event Cards and another set of cards that complicate how you begin the game. The latter set was really cool, ensuring that different players got priorities as far as (1) having the first turn, (2) choosing which territory to start from, (3) choosing their faction first, (4) starting with a different number of troops, or (5) starting with 1-2 extra coin cards. The Event Cards, on the other hand, seemed to consistently reward the player with the highest population -- the one that tended to be already closer to winning -- and we pretty much universally disliked these. They certainly speeded up the game, though. Perhaps there are future packets that we'll open that will make Event Cards less lame, or will give us more Event Cards so they don't consistently reward the person in front.<br/><br/>The game board itself is much more interesting now, due to placing most of the stickers on the board. There are new Scar Cards that allow you to [REDACTED], which is pretty awesome and crazy. In general, the board feels like it has much more character and interest now. South America is essentially barely inhabitable now, due to a series of scars and cities (since you automatically lose troops when you take over cities), but Australia is still a beast of a continent.<br/><br/>In the first game, we managed to trigger 5-6 Event Cards in rapid succession, and Anton -- who was already pulling off an effective Australia strategy -- beefed up on troops really fast and just steamrolled most of the board. Since it was over so fast, we decided to play again and the second game was much more interesting.<br/><br/>The second game started with:<br/>* Anton - Australia, again<br/>* David - Iceland<br/>* Erin - Kamchatka<br/>* Jonathan - South Africa<br/><br/>We ended up only getting one or two Event Cards the whole game, which made it pretty exciting and much more balanced. Plus, having just played a game, we were all in Risk mode and really dug in. Unfortunately, Anton used his victory in the first game to neutralize my attempt at [REDACTED] Australia, so he started out in a strong position.<br/><br/>I took over Africa and Anton expanded out of Australia to attack David's forces in Europe, dissuaded from attacking me by the empty megacity of Davidopolis in the Middle East (which would have eaten 2 troops if he tried crossing it). Erin slowly expanded across East Asia and eventually into Alaska to assault David from the other side. Eventually David dissuaded Anton through a great series of rolls and Anton went south, though the weakpoint in North Africa (which has had an Ammo Shortage scar since game 1, I think) to take out my headquarters. I partially escaped into the deadly continent of South America, but David swung down from Iceland to eliminate me and take my 7 coin cards (bastard!). Erin attempted small assaults on both David and Anton but was outnumbered and kept wanting to consolidate her troops, but she had the faction that rewarded her for expanding, so her moves early in the game meant she was less concentrated in any one place. In the end, Anton won again, though he did it by taking the last of the coin cards (the ones not attached to territories), which automatically means that the player with the most territories gets a red star.<br/><br/>So, in the end, a closely-fought game and one where a new rule was invoked. In both Erin and my cases, if we hadn't been annihilated and had our cards stolen, we would have dropped them for a bunch of troops and become major problems, so it was very back-and-forth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380395/#Comment_380395" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-31T21:08:25+00:00" title="May 31, 2012  9:08PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An attempted assassination is deftly turned into an opportunity, and Pyrol is now accompanied by a six-armed clay demon.
