Something I can contribute to on a positive level...<br>\n<br>\nThe original D&amp;D had a certain element that most games I experience these days are missing entirely.  For lack of a better term, and not desiring to apply a psuedo-scientific term to it, I call that element the cool factor.<br>\n<br>\nIt wasn't about convulted and multi-level storylines; it wasn't about a slick running game system, it wasn't about theory, or doing something different...D&amp;D was about having some fun.<br>\n<br>\n"You mean I get to be this really cool Conan guy and go hack apart monsters and haul away their loot?"<br>\n<br>\nThe main point that I've danced around here is that although D&amp;D was a cumbersome system, it still had a large helping of coolness to it.  The game itself, when broken down to it's ingedients lacked cohesiveness and followed no discernable logic; and the idea of the dungeon crawl simply seemed to be an extension of that lack of logic.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, the mechanics were simple enough that a 12 year old could easily grasp them, the need for cohesion and logic was deeply overshadowed by the fact that it was fun to play, and the core-line monsters were nasty enough to be villains, but somehow endearing enough to be fun to fight in a dungeon near you.<br>\n<br>\nSomehow, someway, all of this twaddle thrown together became a very fun game.  The fact that it was so fun is what made it cool.  It didn't matter that one had inject their own background logic into why the classes had such restricitons.  It didn't matter that elves got every advantage under the stars AND could live forever (well close enough).  It didn't matter that the 80 or so common beasties were pretty much the same thing over and over again with a different line-art sketch as the picture.  What mattered was that it was fun.  <br>\n<br>\nThe fond memories we harbor of our basement antics, munching on chips and downing beverages whilst we played are what we recall.  So we look to the atmosphere to recreate that cool factor....but that isn't it.<br>\n<br>\nWithout the need for subplots (or perhaps even a plot at times), and without the need for realism, we all mamaged to dive into  it with a full suspension of disbelief and enjoy ourselves.<br>\n<br>\nThat abstract and nearly impossible to define element that made the game so enjoyable is what I have called the cool-factor since I started reviewing games, and then later began to create them.<br>\n<br>\nFun is what made D&amp;D cool for us when we were younger, and it is unfortunate that so many designers have forgotten to make their games fun to play, as well as everything else.  And oddly, I find that most games that attempt to incorporate that cool-factor  into them (most especially if they are in a fantasy setting) are usually scorned and labelled as "heartbreakers".<br>\n<br>\nIf you're looking to recreate that feeling from the old D&amp;D, it is not the system itself, nor the trite and cliched scenarios, it was th e'cool-factor'.  That elusive element that cannot be mechanized into a game, nor can rules be made to enforce it.  There is something about a game, any kind of game, that just makes it fun to play; in and of itself.  That is the cool-factor.  I've scrapped many a completed game system, because although it was original, or alothough it was unique, and although it may have been logical and as fun yo play as Game X, or Y; it just lacked the cool-factor.<br>\n<br>\nTo recreate the cool factor, you simply need to forget about all of the tripe about each and every detail of the game, stop breaking it down to a molecular level to the point wher the very thought processes behind a mechanic or rule in the game has some jargon attached to it (that is contantly being debated), and just concentrate on whether or not it's going to be cool.<br>\n<br>\nIf a game is strong in and of iteself, and the mechanics and system are solid enough to be logical and hold up to game play, then it stands to reason that thew system should withstand a pint or two of cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen one stops worrying about the convulution of the rules, and what applies when, or how to make the system withstand attacks from the critics of the opposing gaming camps and begins to enjoy putting cool things into the game for the sake of being fun, then the cool will flow from your games, and that reverie of yesteryear should turn into the phone calls from your peers asking about moving next week's scheduled session to tomorrow night.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63356/#Comment_63356" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T19:16:16+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  7:16PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

There was a lot of Clinton-Coolness there but I have always had a love-hate relationship with Sorcerer and the rolling got to be too much in the few games I played.<br/><br/>c)  I can't say much about the "coolness" of D&amp;D.  All snarkiness aside I think the fun came out of imagination and the fact that we were 12 (or in my case 8).  I recently played a D&amp;D dungeon crawl and to be honest once I put myself into the mental framework of "okay, I'm 15 again" it really was a lot of fun.  But it was a social fun.  A little puzzle solving.  A little role-playing.  A little number crunching.  A lot of soda, chips and side comments about relations between giants and hobbits.  15 again.  <br/><br/>d)  There is a certain simplicity to the dungeon crawl - a simplicity that D&amp;D has always defied.  Donjon is a step in the right direction (for me) but I need to take it further.  I have been playing with some ideas to develop a SG dungeon crawl game.  But it's full development is after my Artesia stint and a political miniatures game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63595/#Comment_63595" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T05:06:34+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  5:06AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A group of Finnish LARPers tried to re-write the classic "Castle Caldwell" module and run it - in several versions - for each other. <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.liveforum.dk/kp07book/lifelike_petterson.pdf" rel="nofollow">It's a fun read</a> - one of the things they found out was that they must have cheated a lot when they were kids, because when they tried to run it again "by the book", they went through about 17 characters along the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63637/#Comment_63637" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T08:45:46+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  8:45AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2007 8:46AM by DirkGently.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>A group of Finnish LARPers tried to re-write the classic "Castle Caldwell" module and run it - in several versions - for each other.<a href="http://www.liveforum.dk/kp07book/lifelike_petterson.pdf" rel="nofollow">It's a fun read</a>- one of the things they found out was that they must have cheated a lot when they were kids, because when they tried to run it again "by the book", they went through about 17 characters along the way.</blockquote>\n*Heh* If everyone else's group was anything like mine we cheated ALL THE TIME!

I'm actually pretty skeptical that the megadungeons they're waxing nostalgic about are producing fun play experiences for anyone except the Dungeon Master. But this little gem on page six was pretty good:\n<blockquote>Playing off of these ideas, and having been recently working through the inevitable complaints regarding ecology that crop up when proselytizing the megadungeon, I've been generating an argument called "How the goblins became human" (with abject apologies to Ignatiev). At some point, goblins stopped being bogeymen in the dark, waiting to snatch unwary children or lone travellers, and simply became a separate species in a pluralistic monster world. The original three books and Moldvay/Cook (my preference) don't speak of females, young, or cultural practices. They simply posit goblins as, well, goblins, and give some information on them fighting better when a chieftain sort is present. I love this presentation, as it gels with the idea of nightmarish, macabre figures in the shadows populating your dungeon, and not the run of the mill humanoid lair, with eating chambers, sleeping chambers, quarters for the ruler and his mate, etc. It's a question of genre to me--in this case, folklore and fairy tale versus National Geographic in a fantasy world. One keeps such beings mysterious and fresh, the other tends to normalize them into boredom.<br/><br/>Three goblins in a room. What are they doing? What does it matter? They are simply lying in wait for hapless folk because they are goblins, and that's a powerful image to me. Don't get caught unawares, or they'll snatch you in the dark.<br/></blockquote>\nMan, the "National Geographic" handling of humanoid races in D&amp;D is an assumption I've never really questioned, but it does kinda stink for a couple reasons: a) it makes the monsters seem less scary, and b) leads to morally disquieting comparisons to various aboriginal/tribal peoples in the real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63891/#Comment_63891" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-14T02:23:27+00:00" title="April 14, 2007  2:23AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><br/>Am I the only one who thinks all of these (there are plenty more: OSRIC, etc) attempts to recapture the gaming Glory Days by means of aping 30-year-old rule design are just plain barking up the wrong tree?</blockquote>No, you're not the only one.<br/><br/>I think it's much better to simply identify major design concepts, <i>axe the ones that suck</i>, and then put the rest together into a game using a more deliberate and modern structure for the rules themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63901/#Comment_63901" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-14T06:27:16+00:00" title="April 14, 2007  6:27AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2007 6:27AM by James_Nostack.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Man, the "National Geographic" handling of humanoid races in D&amp;D . . . leads to morally disquieting comparisons to various aboriginal/tribal peoples in the real world.</blockquote>\nYeah, no kidding.  I was recently toying with doing a D&amp;D-ish game set in the European Middle Ages, and I deliberately wanted to exclude goblins and just use humans as the people to be chopped down without mercy.  The more I began thinking about it, though, the more troubling it became.  Essentially the entire D&amp;D experience--and most of the fantasy novels and canonical literature it's based upon--is founded upon identifying a Racial, Religious, or Ethnic Other, essentializing that Other as Pure Evil, and then slaughtering all of them in a righteous frenzy.<br/><br/>Whatever happened to Tynes's "PowerKill"?  Because that was essentially an attempt to make the same point.  It's cool when you descend into a dungeon, kill goblins, and take their stuff; it's profoundly uncool if you burst into a housing project, kill the people who live there, and loot their corpses.  What's the difference?\n<blockquote>We could go with something radical and not built so much for a Dungeon Crawl, just to see how an indie game or a non-D&amp;D would break a classic dungeon and recreate it into coolness.</blockquote>\nI'm down with that.

(&amp; everyone else)<br>\nYes, I agree that what I was saying might, on the surface, sound like mantra of "system doesn't matter", but that is actually very far from my point.  How about I paraphrase your paraphrasing and directly state that system isn't all that matters.<br>\n<br/>\nA coherent, and playable system is, IMHO, very important to an enjoyable game; however I have found that there are certain abstract, perhaps undefinable, elements that might make up for system shoprtcomings, poor cohesion, bad logic, or any other factors.  D&amp;D was a rare bird.  Let's face it, if it were published today \\, as it was in the original issue, it would be the laughing stock of the RPG world.  However, aside from a haphazard system, mechanics that were neither totally roleplaying nor entirely tactical (kind of an ill-mixed melange of those), and (as has been pointed out) creatures with names taken from mythology and literature and boiled down to the lowest archetypical common denominator, there was still some abstract there that made it fun to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo does system matter?  I vote a giant Hell Yes on that.  Games are more than system.  They are more than theme.  they are more the sum of the text.  I lok at a game as a rules system, mechanics, spirit, heart, theme, and soul.  Whilst some of those are concrete things that can be systematically debated and measured, some are entirely subjective, or abstract.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou asked me if I could give you specific examples of games that I felt the designers had forgotten to make fun.  Yes, I could, but my opniion on such matters was (I felt) not germaine to the discussion, nor called for.  It is undeniably true that ALL game designers want to make a fun game; however I have found that so many of them are so formulaic that they seem like so much generic twaddle.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo edify my statement, I shant throw a burning doo-doo bag on the porch of these excellent game designers' works, but rather ask you this:  How many movies, in your life, have you seen that you thought really truly sucked?  Now do you think that any filmmaker sets out to make a bad movie?<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen a plethora of games that were strong in the concrete and lacking in the abstract.  I've seen just as many of the converse.  To nmake a truly wonderful game, it must be a great system, and it must also find a niche in the spirit and theme, and all other abstracts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat tiny target/goal, like finding the heart of your ex-wife in the courtroom, is the cool factor.  I have yet to be able to pinpoint exactly what it is, or to define it in stoic and sanitary terms, but I can read a game manual, play a game, or look at my own stuff, and let you know if it is cool or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I LOVE your comment about "to make a game cool, you simply make it cool" (please forgive me if that comment is prickish, or confrontational, it is not meant to be, I truly love that comment).  You may feel free to call me any four-letter word of your choosing, and I won't be bothered about it.  Here's my answer.  If you feel the need to break down what I said into hyperbole, then by all means, my answer is a resounding yes.  No game will ever be successful if it isn't cool!  What is cool, you might ask; I can't put it into some convenient definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I could, I imagine that I would be much more successful than the the paultry 5-10K per year that my works bring me.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I was intending to communicate was that so many game designers get far too involved making sure that their pops are banging and that their game fits into either the forgeian camp, or the chaos oppositionists.  I was trying to relate how so many game designers dedicate their rules to making each and every detail a laboratory sanitary aboslute, that they lose track of the primary goal; which is to make a game that is not only fun, but that they want to play again and again.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, I don't concern myself with too much with game design theory, nor do I concern myself overly with those that claim that game design theory is so much piffle disguised as profundity.  I concern myself with whether or not I want to play a game, and whether or not people want to play my games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is almost impossible for me to put a defining finger on what makes any game that way, so I simply call it the cool factor.  A cool game is one that your players call you up en-masse and ask if you can move the next game date forward from next Saturday to tonight.  I cool game is one where the players who come for a 3-4 hour game session, end up going to the gorcery store at 7 AM to get enough food toi cook breakfast for everyone.  A cool game is one where you have to move the furniture out of your living room and create a giant play-table for all of the extra players that have become almost fanatical regulars.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D was like that; and some other games are like that as well.  Is it the system?  No, not entirely.  Is it the GM?  No not entirely.  What is it that makes a game grow beyond a set of mechanics into something that people enjoy?  That, my friend is the cool factor.  I can't give set of instructions for it (i've had far more misses than hits), I can't even give you a list of qualities that cool games have.  I can only notice when a game has all of the factors that will make it cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to make a game cool you simply need to make it cool?  YES!!!!  What about games inspires your passion, your love?  What excitement and joy can be conveyed?  That is cool!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI merely meant to state that so many game designers attempt to emulate a formula or a pattern, and their games suffer from it, because the end product has no heart, no soul, no spirit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I never meant to intimate that one should disregard designing a strong system in order to make a game cool.  I was merely implying that a solid system is not a cool game until the breath of life is injected into it by it somehow attaining that indescribabloe cool-factor as well.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you cited Dogs In The Vineyard as being broken down to the molecular level with everything having a reason for being (In a very Chic French manner).  True.  Very true.  I do own the game, and we do play it occassionally.  It's a great game, and I apologize if I ruffled your feathers.  I wasn't pointing any fingers at all, just spouting my observations from the past few decades.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe RPG world is very similar to the Video Game world right now.  A used game cube system is selling for less than a used NIntendo NES.  IN fact, the Yobo company, and others, are marketing their clone systems to America right now.  Now why is it that a good running NES is goung for $80 on th eopen market when a used Playstation 2 is going for $70?  The PS2 has thousands of times more memory, roughly 63KL more colors, hundreds of times the resolution, and all sorts of bells and whistles.  The fact remains that those old and outmoded NES games were simply much more cool.  There ius a certain something, that is hard to define, that makes Maqrio World more desirable to play than SOCOM 12, the apology.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow is Dogs the rule, or the exception?  I am not the one to judge, the public is.  I think it's cool, a rare gem amongst so much crap.

They're not trying to recapture their glory days, they're just playing with a system they like with some minor updates to keep it current. <br/><br/>If they're seeking to relive their glory days then they're out of luck and I think you're right, but I think often people assume that's the motivation when actually these guys would be quite happy playing the original rules too but see these as incremental improvements.<br/><br/>Osric is explicitly about enabling people to release material for AD&amp;D without having to pay licencing fees, so as to encourage fan produced material.  That's not about recreating glory days, it's about continuing them.  Personally I couldn't stand AD&amp;D so it's not for me, but I think it's a mistake to think it's a nostalgia product.  It has a different, and quite explicit, purpose.<br/><br/>Edit:  I missed ffilz's post which also made the Osric point.  On C&amp;C, the point of it is that it is what some people wanted 3e to be, they wanted that old school D&amp;D flavour but with more unified and streamlined mechanics.  Those folk were very disappointed with the complexity of 3e, so C&amp;C is their replacement for it.  It's a positive choice, not a nostalgic one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64360/#Comment_64360" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T06:21:14+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  6:21AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite>...but what's wrong with that?

C&amp;C just does not do it for me.<br/><br/>I'm not persuaded it succeeded in its goal personally, so I don't much disagree.<br/><br/>The thing is, in arguing that it's not just nostalgia I probably didn't get across that I both agree and disagree with you.  The disagreement bit is upthread, where I agree is that if one is trying to recreate that old school feel because one has decided that one wants to go back there having left it then I do not think these games are the answer at all.  Playing Basic will not make you a 14 year old discovering gaming for the first time again, that's a hopeless crusade.<br/><br/>Playing Basic because you like it as a system and are choosing it as a positive choice of what you want from a system is cool, playing Basic because you want to recapture that old school feel is likely to fail IMO.  <br/><br/>The essence of that lost feel IMO is the feeling of possibility, that you can do anything.  A sense of freedom.  I'm not sure how mechanically one restores that, but I do agree the answer is not in blindly going back to the systems you first found it with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex" title="Alex"><img alt="Alex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex">Alex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64374/#Comment_64374" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T07:27:44+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  7:27AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>It seems to me that a hallmark of old school is to ignore the system, ergo, why ape those old systems?

Frankly I see a strong bias hereabouts in favor of "story-oriented" gaming, and I believe that people whose version of "old school" entailed trying to shoehorn that style into those rulesets--successfully or not--have a very different vision of "old school" from people who either came to those games with a different bias or who took a "rules-first" approach to see where that would take them.<blockquote>It seems to me that a hallmark of old school is to ignore the system, ergo, why ape those old systems? Why not find a way to create a system that supports the way a lot of people were actually playing?</blockquote>Certainly if you talking about TFT, you're speaking from ignorance, plain and simple. I can't speak to C&amp;C; however my experience with white box D&amp;D and AD&amp;D was that we didn't ignore the system. The rules were largely followed, they just didn't cover everything. If they did a good job at what they covered, and that provided a baseline to work off of when dealing with everything else, then they were doing their job, and they continue to do their job.<br/><br/>Now as it happens there are a number of things that D&amp;D does that I don't care for, but I think from your perspective D&amp;D is practically indistinguishable from Runequest, TFT, Dragonquest, Tunnels &amp; Trolls, even Big Eyes Small Mouth. However from my perspective those games all have significant differences which make them more to my taste than unhouseruled D&amp;D, so resurrecting, preserving, and refining them still makes a great deal of sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64412/#Comment_64412" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T09:54:24+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  9:54AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2007 9:54AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd play TFT in a minute.

Sure, I NEVER saw a group actually use the weapons adjustments by armor types from D&amp;D;/AD&amp;D;, and certainly there were other ignored rules, and perhaps there was some fudging, but by and large, we followed the rules - or at least what we thought the rules were. It was only somewhat later, as people started to look for different experiences, and people started to want "story" that ignoring the rules became more prevalent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sure, you will never recapture that experience of first playing D&amp;D.; But it's actually quite easy to recapture a lot of the old school feel. Just by playing the game. It didn't last very long because of conflicting commitments, but I recently started an AD&amp;D; 1e based campaign (admitedly using some house rules I had developed in college), and it was quite fun. And we were able to get through way more fights than we were getting through using Arcana Evolved/D20/3.5.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as to re-creating that old school feel, I guess it depends on what your goal is. I think there is room for a rehashed AD&amp;D; 1e style game that provided a streamlined game, got rid of some of the worst of the troublesome rules (spells and such), but stayed close to AD&amp;D.; The same for any other old school game that was successfull. There's also room for things like OSRIC whose purpose is not strictly to replace and improve on the game, but to breathe new life into the old game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also room for new fangled games that look at some aspect of old school gaming, perhaps one that wasn't actually well supported by the text, or perhaps the way the game was played didn't quite work, and produce game mechanics that actually do that thing well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64417/#Comment_64417" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T10:12:34+00:00" title="April 19, 2007 10:12AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite><br>It seems to me that a hallmark of old school is to ignore the system, ergo, why ape those old systems?

This comes up frequently on ENWorld. A lot of people, like me, played for years without really knowing or using most of the rules. (There's a heavily-footnoted PDF on Dragonsfoot that explains how AD&amp;D1e combat really works. It's awesome, but it looks nothing like any AD&amp;D I ever played.) Some people used the rules perfectly.<br/><br/>My memory is a combination of outright ignoring (copious house-rules or doing things like plugging in the early <i>Arms Law</i>) and simply exploring uncharted territory. Given that, I'm not sure how one designs to recreate the experience, other than making a system that encourages house rules and  leaves lots of things unexplored.<br/><br/>Which, honestly, is what some of the newer "old school" games seem like to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64421/#Comment_64421" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T10:57:08+00:00" title="April 19, 2007 10:57AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>What definition of "system" are we using for this conversation?

My point was that all of these old school games, save AD&amp;D1e, have anything from moderately to very clear rules for the things they cover; AD&amp;D1e is a mess of course but even so this was (often? generally?) handled not by ignoring rules but by paying enough attention to them to, effectively, edit them into a usable form. Granted this then generally served as the basis for extending the mechanics--as I argued elsewhere, things like the "dropped lantern table" in Runequest are more like fossilized evidence of that process in action, than prescriptive rules.<br/><br/>That deserves a bit of explanation. Most RPGs of the era consisted of two or three unified core systems, combat, magic, and skills. Sometimes all three were integrated, sometimes not. But those rules were basically complete and playable. Other situations were handled on an ad-hoc basis, and when something was both important and occurred frequently enough, someone would make up additional rules for it. Like aerial combat, or ships, or supply rules, whatever. But both these things, and the other stuff that was handled less formally, had as their baseline the core mechanics. So lanterns dropping in the midst of combat was a frequent enough occurrence that people decided it'd be more fun to resolve the effect of same by rolling on a table, than by simply ignoring the effect or deciding arbitrarily.<br/><br/>However, whatever you used to handle those sorts of peripheral issues (and they were peripheral, in the sort of old school I'm talking about), the core systems weren't there to be ignored, rather the peripheral stuff was largely a method of framing the use of the core systems, to enhance meaning (or "investment"), generate variety, and set up a sort of dialog between the purely mechanical aspects of the game and the socially-negotiated fiction. It's a bit like crystallization of a material around a "seed"; though not as deterministic as the chemical process, the game as whole grows out of the kernel of the "hard rules" and is affected by the structure of the latter even when the game's scope becomes quite large.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64483/#Comment_64483" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T17:51:12+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  5:51PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I wasn't clear, and maybe I wasn't, all the games I listed are more or less "old school", so if your line of logic is:<br/><br/>Old school means the rules are ignored<br/>Therefore there's no point in having different rules<br/><br/>Then since all those games are old school, there's no point in being interested in one versus the other, let alone more than one of them.<br/><br/>Essentially I agree that D&amp;D, particularly AD&amp;D1e, needed to be houseruled just to be playable, and certainly needed to be houseruled to correct for a bunch of things that just didn't appeal to me in terms of how it represents fantasy.

Many old school games were a direct reaction to that, a desire to capture the fun without the cruft.<br/><br/>AD&amp;D is sui generis, you can't really judge old school (or any school) by one game and you certainly can't by one as idiosyncratic as that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64697/#Comment_64697" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T06:44:28+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  6:44AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliot Wilen</cite>Old school means the rules are ignored<br/>Therefore there's no point in having different rules</blockquote>\nI think the issue here is that I agree with Ron's assertion that, back in the day, every group's D&amp;D was their own. My experience matches with this, especially (as we're seeing here) as I come into contact with more and more people who played D&amp;D back in the day. The hobby was so new, and the D&amp;D rules such a (glorious) mess, and people were using it to play in so many different ways, that I think ignoring (or folding, spindling, and dodgering) the rules was <i>definitely</i> a hallmark of how we played back in the day.<br/><br/>Now, keep in min that I'm talking very specifically about D&amp;D. I am not trying to assert that every game in existence back then fostered the same experience (though I do see commonalities). Even as a kid, I knew that RQ was just light years ahead of AD&amp;D, and playing T&amp;T by the RAW was easy.<br/><br/>What I find weird is <i>new</i> games that claim to capture the old school feel (particularly old school D&amp;D), when I know that a big part of that feel, IMO, was dealing with AD&amp;D's goofy rules. It seems more like these newer games are trying to instantiate someone's house-ruled end product. And even then, you see their fans gleefully performing all the patching and extrapolating they did with AD&amp;D back in the day.<br/><br/>I dunno. It just seems kind of futile to me. If you want to recapture what it was like to roleplay when you were 12, why not just <i>play the games you played when you were 12</i> and hope the nostalgia kicks in?<br/><br/>(I haven't had a chance to do so with D&amp;D, but I recently ran sessions of first and fourth edition <i>Gamma World</i> and ran them as per RAW. It felt absolutely nothing like when I was a kid. The unplayable-as-written 1e, if anything, totally got in the way of the fun.)<br/><br/>The kicker is that, IMO, there are many new-school games (D&amp;D3.5, BWr, TSOY) that do a much better job capturing what I was <i>trying</i> to do back then. It's like Greg Stafford's comments about <i>Heroquest</i> being the RPG he had really wanted for Glorantha all along, but they just didn't know how to do that back then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64741/#Comment_64741" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T10:26:58+00:00" title="April 23, 2007 10:26AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I think we're just approaching this from different angles, which was compounded by your use of a phrase that sounded to me like an all-too-common buzzword (no pun intended).<br/><br/>This thread seems to be in its last stages but I'd suggest that anyone addressing "recreating the old school feel" needs to begin by thinking about what that "feel" means to them. For me it had very little to do with the quality of the rules. It's true AD&amp;D was a mess, but that didn't impact actual play for me because I'd already been playing white box D&amp;D, which although written in even worse fractured prose, was simpler and thus made it easer to grasp the "core concepts" (also informed by experience with board wargaming). So coming from there, and especially as we transitioned in stages since AD&amp;D books didn't come out all at once, it was easy to treat AD&amp;D as a bunch of optional rules, but nevertheless to have those rules pretty much nailed down before play.<br/><br/>What I took "ignoring the rules" as, and I think a few others did, too, is the oft-seen canard that older games run on "rule zero" or "GM fiat". All I wish to say about that is, all RPGs employ a great deal of discretion; formally redistributing authority over what happens in the game world doesn't change that, and still allows the participants to depart from the rules as far as they like without breaking them, technically. (If you play D&amp;D and never roll the dice because you never get into a fight or spring a trap, you're following the rules. If you get in a fight and the GM doesn't keep track of the monsters' hit points, simply declaring them dead after enough tension has built up, the GM is breaking the rules. That's my standard, basically.)<br/><br/>So what is "old school dungeon feel" to me, if it doesn't mean houseruling or fudging? To me, it's basically a game where the emphasis is on exploration (requiring actual player skill at mapping), puzzle-solving, and combat, usually without excessive concern about plausibility, morality, or any character-centric issues. The idea is to go in, kill things, take stuff, and get out alive. Being tempted by a few magic items that might do weird shit to you (often based on a die roll) also goes with the territory, as does the prospect of a few weird spectacles just thrown in for atmospherics. In fact it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to describe the old school dungeon as Las Vegas with monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2780/recreating-a-classic-od-d-old-school-dungeon-feel" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2780/recreating-a-classic-od-d-old-school-dungeon-feel" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2780/recreating-a-classic-od-d-old-school-dungeon-feel/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2780%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F2780%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
