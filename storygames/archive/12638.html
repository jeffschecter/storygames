A fight between a party of adventurers and a tribe of orcs in <i>BXD&amp;D</i> if a very different thing from a gunfight in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard.</i><br/><br/><b>Slugfest:</b>old school D&amp;D combat, silver age superheroes and 80's action movies. Straightforward contests of strength and endurance, the winner is the guy who can both take and dish out the most raw damage.<br/><br/> <b>Melees:</b> current editions of D&amp;D, the big fight at the end of a kung-fu flick between the heroes and the villain and his chief henchmen. A big set piece battle with several combatants, each of whose movements and tactics have repercussions for all the other fighters on the field. <br/><br/><b>Obstacle:</b> ninjas and zombies, hoodlums and fight montages, combats in T&amp;T and mook fights in Wushu. Mechanically the combat is highly abstracted, handled as a single challenge to overcome, no different than climbing a sheer wall or fast-talking an inconvenient guard.<br/><br/><b>The Big Beast:</b> Dragons and giant robots. Faced with an opponent that can overpower them utterly physically, the hero has to win (or just escape) via lateral thinking.<br/><br/><b>The Puzzle:</b> Alien horrors and weird science beasties. Similar to the Big Beast, but its a matter of figuring out the opponents singular vulnerability and exploiting it. "He's repelled by silver!" "It has gap in the scales on its belly!" <br/><br/><b>The Duel:</b> Most any swashbuckler film ever made. A one-on-one fight between evenly matched opponents, lots of maneuvering and back-and-forth, decided by a single telling blow rather than accumulation of lesser damage. Lots of finely detailed tactics like stance.<br/><br/><b>Firefight:</b> modern crime thrillers, war movies. Extremely deadly ranged attacks, lots of positioning and diving for cover, frenetic pace, keeping a cool head more important than personal strength.<br/><br/><b>Thematic:</b> Good westerns, gangster films, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>. Fights that are not about the fighting, they're just a means to express the inner conflicts of the characters involved. Its not a showdown of gunplay its a duel between one guy's sense of justice and the other's sense of guilt.<br/><br/>What here can be changed, and what else can be added?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283870/#Comment_283870" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-31T23:59:20+00:00" title="July 31, 2010 11:59PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a big difference here between the role of combat in an rpg and what it looks like/feels like.

The PCs have finite resources for playing the game and part of the GMs duties include wearing away at those resources, with combat being one tactic in their repertoire for doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Solution:</b> Heroic fantasy &amp; supers. Each session heads towards a big fight at the end where the PCs get a chance to physically battle the bad guys and save the day.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Hooking:</b> Almost any game. Combat is used as a way of introducing new clues or plot elements that will involve the PCs further in the plot of the session.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Colour:</b> Richly detailed games. Combat is a way of celebrating or reinforcing the setting of the game world, allowing players to get under the skin of their characters a little more comfortably and get the feeling of living in that world.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Showing Off:</b> Heroic fantasy, supers, martial arts, space opera, etc. The characters have gnarly powers and various cool combat tactics available to them, so combat gives them a chance to exercise these and provide some really cool narration about their character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283875/#Comment_283875" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T00:20:17+00:00" title="August  1, 2010 12:20AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mentioned games as examples of some of the styles you mentioned here, like Dogs for "Thematic," and Wushu for "Obstacle," but do you know of any game examples of the other kinds?

It wasn't so much about having the fastest gaming reflexes or about being the strongest character in the world -- it was about going through a series of puzzles that expanded your character's ability to solve other puzzles, and gave him just the tools he needed to succeed. I wished that kind of gameplay could be recreated in a pen-and-paper roleplaying game too, without being too scripted by the GM or designer ahead of time the way a video game is.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283905/#Comment_283905" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T09:32:59+00:00" title="August  1, 2010  9:32AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James Mullen</cite>There's a big difference here between the role of combat in an rpg and what it looks like/feels like.

I think my justification for the categories I chose was they all require different mechanical support; a system for firefights won't work or play the same as one for slugfests (or it least it shouldn't).

Its been a while, but if I recall correctly they were very descriptive and presented the fight as an epic encounter of very little things scrambling around a very big thing. Also, a smattering of very old semi-wargamish systems which would have completely different combat rules for different kinds of foes. "This is how you fight a knight, now here's how you fight a band of brigands, now here's how you joust, now here's how you fight a dragon..."<br><br>For "The Puzzle," I dont' think I've ever encountered a system that specifically catered to it, except for spot rules in scenarios that say things like "this adamantium golem is completely immune to physical attacks and spells, but can't swim if tricked into the bottomless pool in the next room." <br><br>For "the Duel," theres' <i>PDQ#</i> in <i>Swashbuckler's of the Seven Skies</i>, nemesis fights in <i>Wushu</i>, the duel rules in <i>Castle Falkenstein</i>, and the main combat system in <i>En Garde!</i> Also <i>Fading Suns</i>, but I don't think that system was very good. I'm sure there are plenty more, since swashbucklers is a popular genre.<br><br>"Firefights" that actually feel like firefights (rather than D&amp;D combat at range) can be found in  <i>Recon</i> and <i>Twilight: 2000</i>, and sometimes <i>Cyberpunk 20xx</i> (if the fighters aren't too tricked out with armor and metal bits). Again, I'm sure there are others.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rui%21" title="Rui!"><img alt="Rui!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rui%21">Rui!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283914/#Comment_283914" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T11:18:02+00:00" title="August  1, 2010 11:18AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there.<br><br>Some time ago I wrote this:<br/><br/><a href="http://ideonauta.blogspot.com/2009/05/purpose-of-combat.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ideonauta.blogspot.com/2009/05/purpose-of-combat.html</a><br/><br/>Maybe you'll find it's worth checking out. :-)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283938/#Comment_283938" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T17:21:39+00:00" title="August  1, 2010  5:21PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like your comment about slugfests.

Sometimes success in the previous step confers an advantage in this step (someone gave the PCs a helpful magic item, they discovered the Boss's hidden weakness, or whatever), but other times it came down to just using good tactics.<br/><br/>Winning the Boss Fight would then give the players the clue they needed to progress in the overall story arc, which would continue in the next session with the same basic structure.<br/><br/>It was an outline I used a <i>lot</i> in games where we only had a limited amount of time to play (i.e., weeknight games for busy adults) because while it was pretty predictable, it meant that in each session everyone got to Do Stuff but there was also enough of a sense of "here's why this session is important to the overall campaign" to keep momentum going.<br/><br/>In those games, the role of combat was that of <i>timing mechanism.</i> And, of course, an excuse to roll dice and geek out and say, "Yay!

Pick up any story from about 1970 or so and its all about "thunderous blows raining down" and "impossible! my cosmic blasts can whither entire worlds, yet he still stands!" <br/><br/>In regards to slugfests in D&amp;D, I had an "ah-hah!" moment when I read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Hearts_and_Three_Lions" rel="nofollow">Three Hearts and Three Lions</a>. In a part where the knights Holger and his Moorish ally are fighting through a horde of foes, near the end they're described as weary and battered. Their mail has been torn by dozens of blows, they bleed from bruises and flesh wounds that though individually minor collectively sap their strength, and their swords have struck so many times their edges have been blunted away, leaving them little better than steel clubs. Viewed as an expression of that kind of attrition of prowess, classic D&amp;D combat is an excellent model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284812/#Comment_284812" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T05:55:33+00:00" title="August  8, 2010  5:55AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rui!</cite>Hey there.<br/><br/>Some time ago I wrote this:<br/><br/><a href="http://ideonauta.blogspot.com/2009/05/purpose-of-combat.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ideonauta.blogspot.com/2009/05/purpose-of-combat.html</a><br/><br/>Maybe you'll find it's worth checking out. :-)</blockquote>\nYour list doesn't explain anything, none of that stuff is related to combat. About #1: you can be badass in other ways than in combat. You may think that badassery only relates in combat, but in that case you can as well say "a character good in combat". It's quite easy to see why people would like to play someone competent, but this is not explaining why someone wants to be competent specifically in combat. About #2: You can advance the story in other ways than combat. The question is, why would you use combat for it? About #3: Combat being the whole purpose of the game does not explain what purpose combat has in the game. Why did you make your whole game about combat instead of cooking?<br/><br/>My take is that combat doesn't interest folks because it does something that leads to cool: it is cool in itself.

So much so that, in my experience, they lose a lot when trying to handle multiple combatants.<br/><br/>Also, Firefight in Burning Empires is just that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284929/#Comment_284929" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T09:34:48+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  9:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite>I've both DMed and played in D&amp;D 3.5 campaigns where the majority of sessions followed a fairly strict pattern of:<br/><br/>1) The<b>Warm-Up Fight</b>- usually a random encounter early on in the session, put there mostly to get the players into rolling dice and adding up numbers mode.<br/><br/>2)  a bit of roleplaying/exposition to set up the<br/><br/>3)<b>Plot-Advancement Fight</b>- which is tougher than the warm-up fight, but whose main purpose is to point the players in the right direction for the<i>real</i>fight of the session -- as well as serving to deplete some of the party's resources.<br/><br/>4) A bit more roleplaying and/or exploring, possibly involving either a puzzle to solve or a mechanical yet non-combat oriented challenge such as a trap, a Bluff/Diplomacy/Gather Information scene, a chase scene, etc., and finally...<br/><br/>5) The<b>Boss Fight</b>, where the PCs need to pull out all the stops and expend all of their major resources to survive.

I guess we've focused on combat here because a) its a very common trope across a huge range of games and stories and b) it can be easier to think about models when considering just one subject, rather than the whole range of possible subjects.

That's what I was too tired to think of last night.  You were analyzing models and mechanisms, which I appreciated and really liked reading about.<br/><br/>(My link doesn't, so it's a nearly irrelevant tangent.  Unless those same models or mechanisms also can be used with the other types of dramatic tension, which it's too early in the morning to think about yet.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
