It's always been true of video games. And keep in mind that she's critiquing one aspect of games, as she's careful to point out. There have definitely been a lot of great video games over the past 15 years, so don't judge the medium by the small sampling she shows. And yeah, there have been good games with really problematic attitudes toward women, especially as shown in the first episode (I love the Mario and Zelda series despite this.) Just as there are great novels or films that are nonetheless sexist.<br/><br/>I do have to say I haven't played any of the games "edgy" enough to have you killing the damsel in distress -- yuck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers" title="JoshDemers"><img alt="JoshDemers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/703/nLX7QIP4KZECH.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">JoshDemers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415323/#Comment_415323" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T06:04:21+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  6:04AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just watched that video (part of it).

Tolkien said it so well:<br/><br/>\u201cNow it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway.\u201d <br/>\u2015 J.R.R. Tolkien, The Hobbit<br/><br/>Is it just a matter of balance? Would it be better if men are treated just as horribly as women? Or do our stories have to be so dark? I say this, but if you talked to any of my players you would know that I run pretty dark games. For some reason, I find those stories very compelling. They do have an emotional grab. I wonder if I am horrible to say that I wouldn't cut the Damsel out of my games, but I do want to be more aware of the trope and to find other, equally compelling ways to engage my (currently entirely male) players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415331/#Comment_415331" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T08:31:06+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  8:31AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2013 8:31AM by Paul_T.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the key element is not "nothing bad should happen to anyone vulnerable", it's more about watching for certain trends (and being aware of them) + making sure you don't trivialize the situation for the vulnerable party. For instance, if a certain character suffers some great pain and degradation, don't just treat it as a bit of backstory to gloss over: be sure to address the consequences, the impact on the person and those around them. What sucks is when, say, a male protagonist's loss of his favourite car is treated with more weight in the story than the death of his girlfriend. There are a lot of misogynist tropes which get included in stories and games "just because" -- it's an easy emotional grab for a male audience, or considered to be -- rather than using those situations deliberately and with care, as fuel for powerful, moving stories featuring characters we care about.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, if a character in your story doesn't appear to have *any* say whatsoever in what happens to them, and doesn't get to make any important decisions (which influence the outcome of the story, or at least of that character's personal story), that's probably a bad sign. Take a closer look and ask yourself why you're writing (or playing) things that way.<br/><br/>Edit: I saw that you watched "part of" the video. The best discussion (and a very well-rounded one) happens in the last 5-6 minutes: if you're going to watch anything, watch that part!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415334/#Comment_415334" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T08:46:03+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  8:46AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                              I guess I'll stir the pot and play Devil's Advocate. These games seem to be firmly in the ultra-violent spectrum (I think Borderlands 2 is the only one mentioned that I've played). They feature the deaths of <i>hundreds</i> of people; but they're mostly just men, so that's okay. If even half (equality) of the mooks were women, it would be held up as an example of misogyny. The death of a woman is used to garner an emotional response and this is key; I saw Anita in one of those TED videos where she talked about some of the comments she received on some of her videos. Awful, hateful things that would make you murderous if said to some-one you loved. In fact, the same emotions that these games try to evoke. Her Kickstarter was over-funded within days. <br/>  Just to be clear - these are not games that feature violence against women. These are games that feature <span style="text-decoration: underline;">violence</span>. The (male) protagonist has only violence as an option. He can die, too, but at least the game gives you the option of saving him (that's the whole game-play; surviving by killing). Once you cancel out the gender violence, you're left with the objectification of the female. The point was made that she is a "prize" to be won. In some cases, not even that. She's the ball in a patriarchal game; a good metaphor that deliberately overlooks the emotional bond of love/caring that the games (in they're very limited, stilted way) try to engender in the player. <br/>  So, I would conclude that what we are seeing is not some patriarchal agenda to disempower women; but rather bad, lazy writing.<br/>  It's powerful stuff to see all those game cut-scenes of women being killed over and over. It's meant to be; that is it's function in a lazily written story. It's not the woman that is disposable - it's the plot hook that's a toss-away. Apply the same technique to lazy writing in sit-com plots. Hell, just limit it to examples of the dunce husband/boyfriend  being pwned by his partner. <br/>  We are shown a very narrowly focused symptom of a wide spread disease.  Some of you can't remember a time when there weren't video games; let me assure you that violence against women predates them. And isn't that the real issue - real violence against real women. Doesn't make the video games right; just makes them poorly written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415335/#Comment_415335" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T09:09:15+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  9:09AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2011/03/feminism-101-helpful-hints-for-dudes_17.html" rel="nofollow">Playing Devil's Advocate isn't so nice</a>:\n<blockquote>"There are the occasions that men\u2014intellectual men, clever men, engaged men\u2014insist on playing devil's advocate, desirous of a debate on some aspect of feminist theory or reproductive rights or some other subject generally filed under the heading: Women's Issues.

At the risk of sounding cliche, we all have dark sides and it is healthy to explore them in a controlled manner; we learn a lot about ourselves that way. Or at least, we CAN learn if we keep our eyes open to it. And I think that's why it's so important that people like Sarkeesian are doing what they do; it can be very hard to see things unless we are looking for them and that often means we need to be told what to look for. I know that's true of myself. <br/><br/>I very much agree with her point about the limitations that many games, including table-tops, have regarding non-violent solutions. The games are there to hack and slash, the tropes used in the justification of this violence can be even more insidious because they are seen as secondary to the violence itself,  thus their meaning is glossed over when it ought not to be. <br/><br/>I'm glad to have read this thread, and I'll keep an eye on it; it is pushing me to be more aware of what I'm doing and what I'm offering in my games.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415352/#Comment_415352" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T12:03:46+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 12:03PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Playing Devil's Advocate isn't so nice:"<br/><br/>But can we agree that it sometimes serves a purpose; to promote discussions rather than shut them down, provide relevant links that us "misguided, ill-informed but well-meaning men" can follow; and yes, sometimes just so people can respond viscerally (AAAAAARRRGGHHH).<br/><br/>No, I will never know what it's like to be a woman (or black or Jewish, for that matter).

What sucks is when, say, a male protagonist's loss of his favourite car is treated with more weight in the story than the death of his girlfriend.</blockquote>Yes. A good example of that in another medium: a friend of mine just today said it bothered her that in the new Star Trek film a catastrophe in which huge numbers of innocent people died was quickly glossed over in favor of watching the heroes hunt down the villain.\n<blockquote>These games seem to be firmly in the ultra-violent spectrum (I think Borderlands 2 is the only one mentioned that I've played). They feature the deaths of <i>hundreds</i> of people; but they're mostly just men, so that's okay. If even half (equality) of the mooks were women, it would be held up as an example of misogyny.</blockquote>Actually I disagree: if half the mooks were female and you killed them the same way as the male ones, it would make the game <i>less</i> misogynistic, more feminist even.\n<blockquote>The death of a woman is used to garner an emotional response and this is key ... These are games that feature <span style="text-decoration: underline;">violence</span>. The (male) protagonist has only violence as an option.</blockquote>The problem in the game is the way the woman is called out specially as a victim \u2014 unlike the other violence in the game \u2014 and used as a passive trope to force a reaction from the [male] player. Especially when it's a reaction that combines sex with violence, which is a really dangerous area that has to be managed with finesse (which is in short supply in these games.)<br/><br/>I really like Sarkeesian's point that this is what happens when you create games where the only mode of player interaction with the world is through violence.

It sneaks in and makes you think it's OK because it presents a rationalization for itself. I game with a group of gents that I consider to be fairly forward-thinking, open-minded, and socially aware. So I was taken aback when I presented a female character in the game and the first question I got was, "OK, but what's the HF?" That's "Hotness Factor." My initial response was, "Who cares?" Apparently, they did. But why? They never, NEVER, asked that about the multitude of male characters they interacted with, but that comes up again and again. I reckon I'm gonna put a stop to that. <br/><br/>I do think you're right - tabletops allow for imagination, which makes my group's reaction all the more disturbing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415380/#Comment_415380" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T21:19:42+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  9:19PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I really like Sarkeesian's point that this is what happens when you create games where the only mode of player interaction with the world is through violence.

When you play a game in which they only way you can really force you towards an objective is through violence, that's what people will do. Maybe not every time... but much more often than they would otherwise.<br/><br/>I mean, it's even a trope: "Dude, make sure your plots can survive the death of any NPC. Because you <i>know</i> your PCs will try to kill many or most of them, even if there's no good reason for it!"<br/><br/>When you play something D&amp;D-like, where the only real form of non-negotiated conflict resolution comes through hit point loss and death, when people don't get what they want, they turn to violence: it's the only hammer they have to advocate for their character. Someone doesn't want to give your character what you think she deserves? Ok, what are your options? Well, you can ask them for it. Didn't work? Ok, you can threaten them. Didn't work? Your only remaining option is to kill them and take it.<br/><br/>Play a game where you have other tools at your disposal, and the difference in behaviour is shocking. For example, if you're playing Monsterhearts, when you can't get something you want, most players will try to get (or spend) some Strings on their opposition. That means they will flirt with them, offer them experience, try to sleep with them, or call them names in public. Because that's what's effective in that game, that's your "hammer" which you can use to push towards your objectives.<br/><br/>Think about it:<br/><br/>Here's a person who won't give you what you want. What do you want to do? <br/><br/>Game A: If you shoot them, it's pretty safe for you, and if you succeed (a high probability, since the game is weighted towards you winning fights, more often than not) you will get what you want. If you want to negotiate, they can always decide not to give it you, ever. (This is D&amp;D, Dogs in the Vineyard, hundreds of other games)<br/><br/>Game B: You can try to shoot them, but your odds of success are about 5%, and even if you hurt or kill them, you might not get what you want. Or you can show them a little skin/a nice gift/take them on a date/out-dance them in a public competition, which gives you a 70% chance of success, and if you roll well, you will definitely get the thing you wanted. (This appears more often in non-mainstream or "story" games, in my experience.)<br/><br/>In which game do you think you (hypothetical average gamer) will choose the violent option?<br/><br/>Game design matters.<br/><br/>So, yes, I think tabletop games don't suffer from the Damsel in Distress and similar issues as much as the video games Sarkeesian talks about (although it certainly pops up now and then), but they certainly do, as a category of games, suffer from the violence-is-the-only-form-of-effective-interaction problem.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415389/#Comment_415389" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T21:59:56+00:00" title="June  3, 2013  9:59PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd like to mention that this hasn't been my experience.

And we do play a lot of games where violence isn't the only tool.<br/><br/>(This reminds me of the new "FATE Accelerated Edition", in which the list of skills is replaced by a fixed set of six "Approaches": Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick, Sneaky. This really highlights that there are different ways to solve problems, most of which aren't overtly violent; I think having this up-front in the game mechanics will help players think more creatively.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
