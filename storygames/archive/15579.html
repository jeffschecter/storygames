I came up with his contacts and their names. I came up with ten distinctive pieces of futuristic equipment (and statted them), <b><i>including coming up with company and product names for every single one</i></b> (and little backstories in my head for some of them as well). <br/><br/>Between each of these activities, I swung back to my own character name, but kept stalling or coming up blank. I even had the Story Games Names Book in front of me, as well as the Power Of the Internet, and simply could not come up with a name for the life of me. I think this is a habit of mine, for some reason coming up with a Great Name for my PC is not as hard as doing all other generation/preparation tasks combined. <br/><br/>In games where PCs have a codename, I usually don't have a problem with the codename, but when it comes back to their "real name" again my brain-meat comes to a grinding halt.<br/><br/>WTF?<br/><br/>Anyone else suffer from this terrible blight? Anyone have advice?<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>( I eventually came up with a mixed Portugese-Vietnamese name, "Jaime Le" )                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353134/#Comment_353134" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T14:41:45+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  2:41PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I used to have this problem quite a bit when I first started gaming.

Real names aren't a problem -- flip open a phonebook, stab my finger at a page, repeat until I find a last name and a first name that sound okay to me (as in, I can imagine someone would name their kid that, and I don't think it'll be hard for me or anyone else to use it in the game).<br/><br/>But a codename?  Shit, that has to <i>mean something</i>, and it's really hard to tell what's going to sound incredibly dumb three seconds after it's too late to take it back.  I agonize over codenames, and the closest thing to a shortcut I've found for generating them is to flip through a thesaurus, which isn't all that helpful.  It's a nightmare, is what I'm saying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353152/#Comment_353152" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T17:07:30+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  5:07PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is why I like playing Apocalypse World -- it is for whatever reason a hundred times easier to come up with a completely ridiculous, a-cultural, arbitrary-noun type name than it is to find a reasonable, existing-human-culture name that doesn't somehow sound wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353157/#Comment_353157" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-04T17:18:17+00:00" title="January  4, 2012  5:18PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            my method<br/><br/>the more physical strength the character has the fewer syllables will be in their name. extra strong characters get names that are almost sound effects<br/><br/>so my brute in skyrim is called KANG in caps<br/><br/>my artistic crafting mouse guard character?<br/><br/>Timothy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353223/#Comment_353223" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-05T11:56:17+00:00" title="January  5, 2012 11:56AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The name generator I use for normal people is the phone book.

If none of the names work then I move to the next-most appropriate region and start over. Sometimes I'll take pieces of two different names and smash them together. The important thing here is I have to decide ahead of time what part of the world my character comes from and/or where his ancestors came from; that makes it easier to figure out which name category to start with. If it's a fantasy world I try to come up with what might be an appropriate analogue and maybe morph the name a bit if necessary (for example, for some reason all of my halfling characters have French last names - I have no idea why but it just sounds right).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
