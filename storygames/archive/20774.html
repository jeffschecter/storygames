I was wondering if anyone here's played it and has any opinions they'd care to share about whether the emergent gameplay actually evokes the "hacker" feeling and action that the pitch tries to evoke.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semiomant" title="semiomant"><img alt="semiomant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semiomant">semiomant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456203/#Comment_456203" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T13:16:31+00:00" title="September 12, 2016  1:16PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I came close to playing but when I saw the hardcore death spiral in this game I canceled all my plans for it.<br/><br/>My personal disappointment aside, the autor constructs a network system that is very ideosyncratic but only very distantly related to real world networks (e.g. all networks are always-broadcast networks). Still, you *CAN* probe this construct for weak operational security or get passwordz with social enigeering (disgruntled employees,torture,blackmail or mind reading). If this kind of hacking - following the autor into his ideosycratic systems rabbit hole in a grimdark world - is your thing, the game will work fine.<br/><br/>It is a workman-like, post-Dungeon-World-savvy design. It just features design descisions that make it an alomst complete failure for me.<br/><br/>I know you wanted AP experience, from the above post I gather you have only very few facts, and I can at least offer you what i gathered from the complete readthrough of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456213/#Comment_456213" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T16:06:02+00:00" title="September 12, 2016  4:06PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've read the book, but not played it.<br/><br/>I couldn't get past the "directory listing" (i.e., table of contents) at the front of the book that shows "/root/ls -lad" as the command.

I recently released a free expansion to Cryptomancer, Code &amp; Dagger: Volume I, that provides alternative campaign rules allowing a more heroic ending (namely, storming the Spire and taking the Risk Eaters head on). Code &amp; Dagger is free and you already own it... I added it the the files for the Cryptomancer download at DriveThruRPG, so if you go back and look, it's there!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/papa_shell" title="papa_shell"><img alt="papa_shell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/papa_shell">papa_shell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457784/#Comment_457784" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-02T01:35:45+00:00" title="November  2, 2016  1:35AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I couldn't get past the "directory listing" (i.e., table of contents) at the front of the book that shows "/root/ls -lad" as the command.</blockquote>\nTotally correct! I blew it on some of the Linux commands because I was doing it from memory, at the last minute. I should have tested all bash commands before pushing my game to production. I will be editing that soon (along with a few grammar and typos in the primary text). However, Code &amp; Dagger has a ton more Linux-fu to critique if you're interested in taking a look.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457799/#Comment_457799" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-02T15:29:23+00:00" title="November  2, 2016  3:29PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I actually did get past it and read the entire book.

Especially in IT and security, there is a very real and justifiable insistence on credibility and authority. The game's subtext is that the authors know what they are talking about, and that slip-up shakes that subtext.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
