It will utterly fail you for doing counter-terrorism action-adventure blackops stuff.  It focuses on the dehumanizing nature of being a spy.  In particular the game focuses on two spies, always two regardless of the number of players.  It is always set in Berlin between the 1950s and the 1980s.  It's pretty constrained but does what it does very well.<br/><br/>It works in round-robin manner with each player taking a turn to add one thing to the developing fiction.  Seriously, just one thing at a time.  The two spies are not necessarily guaranteed to the be the protagonists and have no plot immunity.  They might both be killed out of the gate.  The game simply revolves around their activities and it's perfectly possible for say, their boss, to be the "real" protagonist over time.  Usually the game stays focused on the spies but that's a property of the groups commitment to developing them than a mandate of the game.<br/><br/>Wilderness of Mirrors is much better at doing "mission" games where there's a goal and the group is operating as team to accomplish the goal.  I have played Spione, I have not played Wilderness of Mirrors so it makes it harder for me to comment on it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215512/#Comment_215512" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T14:51:32+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  2:51PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse:<br/>Can you give me a rough idea of what a smallish group of players might accomplish in an evening of play of Spione?

There are 14 guy sheets (representing the character's personal life) and 9 spy sheets (whiich includes everything from who the spy is working for all the way down into the target of their spying).  The two people responsible for "running" the two Principles selects one of the guy sheets and pairs it with one of the spy sheets.  The text refers to the genre of the game as Spy vs. Guy.   The idea is that all you have to do to get effective Spione play is split the priorities of the spy between the elements on his Guy Sheet and the elements on his Spy Sheet.<br/><br/>On the Guy Sheet is a list of Supporting Characters.  A game of Spione ends when the final fates of those Supporting Characters is determined.  There are two ways a Supporting Character meets a final fate.  The first is using the conflict mechanic in which someone uses a double-card narration to permanently kill or imprison the supporting character.<br/><br/>The second involves something called The Trespasses.  Trespasses are pulled from the players REAL LIFE experiences and are moments where either they themselves or someone they personally knew did something, by their judgment, that was morally wrong.  The principle players each pull a Tresspass out of a hat and incorporate it into the understanding of the character.<br/><br/>At any point a principle player may choose to reveal his Trespass making it public.  When that happens every conflict after that point one of his supporting characters WILL leave the game via mechanic called the fate deck (basically a draw of cards that determines a range of possible outcomes the player may choose for that character).  This is the only way that Supporting Characters may have "happy endings."<br/><br/>So there's a lot of group control over how long the game lasts.  Lots of action?  Lots of blood shed via the conflict mechanic?  Drives the game to conclusion faster.  If the Principle Player chooses to reveal his Trespass, again, game is ending rapidly.  There are between 2 and 4 Supporting Characters on each Guy Sheet.<br/><br/>All my Spione games have been single session.  However, I've always felt slightly rushed in them.  I think Spione works well in the two to three session range.  More than that would be pushing it.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>P.S. Oh!  To hack the game to other eras you'd have to come up with new Guy and Spy sheets.  That's about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215529/#Comment_215529" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T15:15:10+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  3:15PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wilderness is available only in PDF, and is pretty short.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215567/#Comment_215567" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T17:25:25+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  5:25PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2009 5:26PM by Moreno R..">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse did a good job of explaining the rules of the game contained in Spione, but it's only a part of the package. Spione is really something different from what it's commonly though as a rpg (even here in story games), it's primarily a book about the war of spies during the cold war. In history and in fiction. It's a book with an authorial voice, that take position in real-world matter, and it contain many points that a lot of people would find controversial. One of these is that was passed for "facts" during the cold war was in fact propaganda, fiction, and if you want to search for the truth, you have to look in the works hidden under the label of "fiction". THEN, at the end of the book, there is a game system to create with a group of friends that kind of fiction.  It's not really paragonable to a rpg with a game setting.<br/><br/>If you want something really different, and the idea of playing real people in the maw of history interest you, I suggest you play Spione (hell, I would suggest any game creator worth his salt should play Spione, if only to see its elegance and efficacy). If you want something more "traditional" where spying is an escapist fantasy, I suggest Wilderness of Mirrors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215570/#Comment_215570" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T17:53:09+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  5:53PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno makes a good point.

The book is primarily concerned with exposing the real-world historical issues that prompted the creation of the source fiction and how those interplay.  It's funny that Moreno points out the difference between what the book does and a traditional "game setting."

One of the best games I have ever seen for this kind of game environment.  It plays rather quick, too  Our play by post took 5 months to start to finish, but only because it was plagued by long absences from different players.  It was 376 post long, counting even rules questions and comments. This is <a href="http://www.gentechegioca.it/vanilla/comments.php?DiscussionID=661&amp;page=1#Item_2" rel="nofollow">the index</a> with the links to the single threads (it's all in Italian, sorry)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>What would you consider to be a better pace in terms of length  of sessions and number of sessions, Moreno? Also, do you have any preferences for a certain number of players?</blockquote>\nI have never played Spione with a lot of players. Usually 3, sometimes 4 and only once with 5, and they were often different players, some much slow than others, and every time someone had to learn the rules, so I am not sure how it scale with lot of players, but my supposition is that more players would mean a shorter game (more cards, a bigger percentage of negative cards ----&gt; more dead supporting cast characters, and more time to think). The pace should not be affected very much, I think.  The duration can change a lot, and it depends of the cards you choose. You can select characters for a shorter or a longer game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
