Peter's idea is nice. You could do it by giving the player that has the highest Hx with you choose a book.<br/><br/>Alternativelly... You don't have to advance the second you ding up. Find a natural lull in play, and flip through the books then.<br/><br/><br/>When I find that I have new players who have trouble with this, I usually give them some guidance on this. And ask questions, of course.<br/><br/>What is the character's natural highest stat? Show him other playbooks with the same highest stat.<br/><br/>What kind of ability would they like to have, generally speaking? Better fightiness? Show him either the playbooks that are generally good at that kind of thing (the Hard playbooks - Gunlugger, Chopper, Touchstone), or propose a specific move (Ice Cold for Cool characters. Hot with a blade for Hot ones. Brain whispers for Weird ones).<br/><br/>Is there any specific direction that I or the player think that the character is heading and I know of a move that would compliment that. So you found a pre-war military base? Hey, if you look at the Driver's playbook, there's a "My other car is a tank" move there.<br/><br/>This kind of needs the MC to be familiar with the playbooks, which isn't always the case... But it usually is the case that he's more familiar with them than the players. If there's any downtime between sessions or during a game, that's when this conversation could take place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351460/#Comment_351460" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T11:06:50+00:00" title="December 14, 2011 11:06AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>This kind of needs the MC to be familiar with the playbooks</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I think this is the crux of the issue, really - if you have <em>at least one</em> player who knows the playbooks a little well, and a bit of willingness to bend the moves to fit, you can get great stuff.</p>\n<p>For instance when I decided that my Maestro D' needed to become a creepy witch, first I had her start acting like a creepy witch and <em>then</em> I was like, "Okay I need a creepy psychic power and access to Augury," so I looked around at the creepy psychic playbooks, took Lost from the Skinner and the one from the Savvyhead that makes your workspace into an augur, defining my workspace as "my parties." I didn't really <em>need</em> to know more about the playbooks than "this one has creepy psychic stuff in it," so it's not an overwhelming knowledge burden.</p>\n<p>You shouldn't think of "get a move from another playbook" as "your character starts doing a new thing."

You'll know when the fiction *demands* that you take a move, because of what is happening dramatically. For example, your wimpy, cowardly character suddenly decides to stand up to the gang local thugs and fight for the life of a little girl he's got a crush on? Take the Not to be Fucked With move, right there, and give those thugs a whoopin'! Your little boy just grew up.<br/><br/>(I would also recommend only picking moves from playbooks that are not in play, it'll help narrow down your options.)<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun with my first advance in a recent AW game. My character was the Quarantine, some guy who wakes up from stasis and has no idea where he is. The first person he meets, he asks them, "Who am I? What's my name?" And the other character replies, "Oh, you're the Messiah." Turns out there's some weird prophecy/cult thing going on who are expecting their Messiah to appear... and here's this oddball character who just appeared out of nowhere. Well, put two and two together, right?<br/><br/>So, I figure: to my character, it seems like he's dreaming, or in some sort of afterlife... nothing makes sense, and now people are calling him a Messiah. What's going on?<br/><br/>A couple of scenes later, there's a bit of a scuffle and someone is killed. A friend, a buddy, of the other characters. He's lying there, dead. Everyone's going, "Well, what do we do now?" And some people are looking at the Quarantine.<br/><br/>The Quarantine is confused, he doesn't know what's going on. Is he dreaming? Is this messed-up world even real? Is he really some kind of Messiah, as the people say?<br/><br/>So he walks over to the corpse and puts his hands on him and calls his name. Something weird happens, and suddenly the Quarantine is screaming... and <i>the dead guy opens his eyes.</i><br/><br/>What happened? I had just earned an advance, and I saw an opportunity for a cool scene, so I told the other players what I was doing... and bought the "Healing Touch" move from the Angel's playbook, right at the moment I touched the dead guy. Made for a fun scene, and quite a surprise!<br/><br/>Taking new moves can be great fodder for drama. Save your advances until you have a good idea and then go for it!<br/><br/>(The advice to head towards another playbook is good, too. If this "Messiah" thing keeps developing, I'll probably be taking moves from the Hocus playbook in the future for the Quarantine. Maybe he'll start a cult following, who knows?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351488/#Comment_351488" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-14T13:28:09+00:00" title="December 14, 2011  1:28PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sort of think that you could just tell the MC what you want and the two of you could work up a move that does something like that.
