All I know is that I sold 36 copies in 30 days, with a very large percentage of buyers (maybe all, for all I know) coming from S-G.  I am pretty sure that many of my sales were due to general interest in Jared's contest, and not because of anything about Out There itself.<br/><br/>My efforts:<br/>I put actual play threads here, on the Forge, EnWorld, and RPGnet, and worked out an independent playtest post on RPGnet.  <br/>I linked from all these to a very simple web page I made, which included: 1) brief, basic game color, 2) list of core play dynamics, 3) cover image, 4) PayPal button, 5) ordering notes (file size etc.).  <br/>With each order I fulfilled (via email), I provided a link to my blog's Out There page, and requested, essentailly, "If you write about this game, tell me!"  (I hope this wasn't annoying.  I was succinct...)  To date, no replies.<br/><br/>I'm mainly starting this thread to help me learn more about marketing RPGs.  Feel free to wander off the specific question in the thread title if it's within that spirit.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>-David                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191092/#Comment_191092" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-03T18:27:01+00:00" title="February  3, 2009  6:27PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never heard about it or, if I did, no image stuck in my head.

It's dark, but not in a noir way, not in a cool b/w way, and not in a goth way - just a lot of black. I can't make out what the greenish textures are, and from the quick glances I gave the cover, they gave me the (subliminal/subconscious) impression that the image was smudgy or unclear. These one-second fleeting impressions are everything in marketing.<br/><br/>The concept was never entirely clear to me. Paranormal investigation or something, yeah? I've played some games like that, and they always seem to go for a silly and light-hearted feel. <br/><br/>The title doesn't stand out from the crowd. "Out There" is probably a good description of the game, but it doesn't put images - or, more importantly, questions - in my hed. "Thy Vernal Chieftains" makes me go "what's Vernal? and why 'thy'?"<br/><br/>So, all in all: The cover didn't do it for me, and there was nothing else to grab me when I browsed some random threads.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191152/#Comment_191152" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T03:17:07+00:00" title="February  4, 2009  3:17AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everybody on Team Sexy Deadly bought Out There, probably because you were our only competition and sheer curiosity drove us to it.

So either that stuff isn't as clear as I think, or you're alluding to something else I've blanked on.<br/><br/>Graham, I take it those methods didn't qualify as grabby mechanics.

I had no idea it was part of a contest.<br/>\nI like investigation horror games. I've toyed with my own mechanics.  I think I could say I was your target audience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the mechanics mentioned in the actual play seemed interesting.  But the descriptions were still a bit vague.  (I was speed/skim reading too, so maybe my comprehension was just poor).<br/>\n<br/>\nI went to the web page.  It seemed basic.  I figured I'd wait and see if there were more Actual Play reports or just generalized talking about the game before I purchased.  I didn't at all feel rushed to buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the ritual of buying things via paypal or credit card is more of a psychological hurdle for me than I'd like to admit.  Had I seen it in a store and I could just give a 1$ for it, I would have.  But having to punch in my information to some random site... was just a bit more of an investment than I was willing to give.  Much more significant than the cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other factor was, I have many games I can't seem to find people to play. I really don't need another game on my shelf taunting me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly later did I realize it was part of a competition.  I then thought for a moment, I should buy it just to support the crazy competition.

Sorry about that.<br><br>What I mean, I think, is that even though the concept itself is clear enough - paranormal investigation - it doesn't stand out from other concepts. I vaguely remember thinking "couldn't I just do this with PTA?" I don't think I ever read the details you mention (no prep etc). <br><br>So, quite honestly, it looks like I never actually got to the point where I read how the game plays. I stopped at "bland cover, familiar concept", and never went past that. <br><br>I know that sucks! But I'm being brutally honest. There are way too many cool games out there now - I probably have a dozen games on my shelf that I haven't tried yet, and there are free games on the net I want to try out. New stuff is being thrown out all the time. Doesn't matter if your game plays well; if it doesn't make me sit up and notice <i>before I even know what it's about</i>, chances are I'll forget it as soon as I hear about it.<br><br>I would have noticed covers with images like the ones below, for example - even though some of them are really crap, they have personality, and personality is more than enough reason for me to spend a buck.<br><br><img alt="image" src="http://www.ufobc.ca/yukon/n-canol-abd/images/fig09-aliens-crop.jpg"/><br><br/><img alt="image" src="http://antisyphus.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/detective.jpg"/><br/><br/><b>ADMIN EDIT: <a href="http://www.centralfloridaeffects.com/crime3.jpg" rel="nofollow">It's a FAKE rotting body, but still it looks kinda nasty, so you'll have to click here to see it kthxbye.
