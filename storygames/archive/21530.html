This can be proven by asking your chosen Leader, they will vouch for you. You have all the benefits and duties of a community member, which is only relevant in this community, and can be ascertained by asking the Leader.<br/><br/><b>Leader:</b> You are a member of this class because your community votes you to be - that is, there exists a community that vouches for you. You have all the benefits and duties of a Leader; because your status as a Leader depends on the existence and recognition of your community, plus your factually being their Leader, you will sometimes have to have an honor guard of community members going around with you to witness and prove that yeah, he really is our leader. Communities are continuous enough that it's more rare for anybody to question the very existence of your community, but for a new one that surely is something that needs to be done.<br/><br/><b>Outlaw:</b> A community has outlawed you, which means that their Leader does not vouch for you when asked. This could have drastic significance, or none at all, depending on whether you're somehow dependent on their continuing goodwill.<br/><br/>This old and familiar social system is a reputation scheme, isn't it? Those three basic classes can have variations, but the core is simple, and it can be implemented without computers: your community just has to have enough joint meetings so you can choose your leaders, whoever they may be, and there needs to be enough communication between communities that they can vouch for whomever when necessary. Sure, it can take a few days to confirm that a given person really has the status he claims in some distant place, but then if it's too distant it might also be locally irrelevant.<br/><br/>The basic resource distribution that goes with this sort of reputation scheme, by the way, is that everybody gets equal shares of stuff, except the leaders get extra. Could be double for the leaders, or the leaders take half and the followers take half, or whatever. Outlaws get nothing. So this really is a reputation economy scheme in that economy takes place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470725/#Comment_470725" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-17T19:21:26+00:00" title="March 17, 2018  7:21PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure how that would work in a sci fi context, with bigger and more complex societies.

These are two vital roles in the outlaw community.  They act as record-keepers and authenticators of Reputation.<br/><br/>Whenever you do something to raise your rep, you and the party you've done right by should visit a Contract Warden.  For a very small fee, the Warden will verify the Rep change and provide whatever serves as proof -- a hard-to-force mark of some sort, I guess.  Scroll, tattoo, hologram, seal, profile card update, whatever.<br/><br/>Snitch Hunters' job it protect this system from any attempts to game or cheat it, mostly by govt agents or other organizations hostile to the outlaw community.  They are dangerous badasses, think tax auditors crossed with the Inquisition.  When a really big or iffy-looking change in Rep occurs, you might want to request an audit to prove that everything's on the up and up, lest the Snitch Hunters come for you on their own later.  Whereas Contract Wardens judge quickly and require only "close enough" evidence, Snitch Hunters do tons of research and investigation.<br/><br/>Contract Wardens are pretty ubiquitous.  It isn't that hard to become one.  Most are trustworthy.<br/><br/>Snitch Hunters are very rare, ruthlessly vetted, and completely untouchable.  To the extent that the outlaw community has laws, Snitch Hunters don't have to abide by most of them.<br/><br/>Snitch Hunters and Contract Wardens all keep records of the Reputations of anyone they've ever rated, so if you lose your proof of Rep, just go back to the last pro you dealt with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470736/#Comment_470736" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-17T22:12:15+00:00" title="March 17, 2018 10:12PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I considered something like a Contract Warden - people with Johnny Mneomic (the book not the film) skills to mentat-like record details.

For instance, consider this:<br/><br/>A <b>Centurion</b> what we call a Citizen who has been selected by a voting district as an elite member. We call them a Centurion because these districts are relatively small, a hundred people or so on average; each company, school, housing block chooses their own Centurions. A given person might belong to several districts as a voting member.<br/><br/>If Centurions were simply executive officials, we'd be doing straight democracy. However, we want this to be an economy rather than a political model, so we'll say that the Centurion isn't a job - it's a reward. The Centurion always gets first pick of everything in their district. If somebody has some luxury, the district is honor-bound to make sure the Centurion gets it first. They get to speak first in council. They are chosen to represent their district in honorable situations as a matter of course, because they are the best that the district has to offer.<br/><br/>A given district can elect several Centurions if they want, only limited by their ability to provide their Centurions with the appropriate honors. A richer district could have as many as 10% of their population elected as Centurions. Most Centurions are probably elderly, respected people, or otherwise widely respected in their immediate community.<br/><br/>Centurions also form the voting population for when multiple districts convene in council to choose Myrmidons. There's probably some sort of gut-check on whether somebody's a real Centurion - like your district needs to afford a fee, and to be able to get you dressed up nicely, and all the other things that are expected of Centurions. If they aren't doing that for you, either it's not a real district, or you're not their Centurion.<br/><br/><b>Myrmidons</b> (named for how they represent a myriad - 10 000 - people, ha ha) are the popularly rewarded elite of entire towns and such, bringing together the interests and concerns of dozens of districts. They get all the privileges of the Centurions, and more, because they get the best of everything in the town, in every district.<br/><br/>The next soviet up the chain would consist of many Myrmidons, obviously, and they'd be choosing an <b>Exarch</b>, perhaps, to lead the million people of a small country or great city. The real point, though, is that at each level of "representation" (we're not really choosing leaders here so much as retirees or nobility or something like that) the rewards grow higher, and you only get to advance by having a good reputation among your peers. Furthermore, the councils that elect these VIP members of society may recall them at any time, so you have to maintain your popularity among your peers for them to decide to maintain your grant.<br/><br/>Why would a local district elect a Centurion at all? Motivating people might be one reason: if you don't have a money economy, then perhaps the district splits everything evenly among its members, and getting to be the Centurion could be a reward, sort of an "employee of the month" thing? It would also be useful in distributing out stuff that not everybody can have - for example, who's going to get the nicer apartments when there are only a limited number of them? The Centurions, of course.<br/><br/>Another reason would obviously be that if your district doesn't have a Centurion, then you don't have a voice and representative in choosing the local Myrmidons. That might sting, as you're going to participate in maintaining the Myrmidons anyway. Plus, they're going to be local celebrities, so of course you want to ensure that the Myrmidon or several of them that your town selects shares your values and is the best person you could choose.<br/><br/>How about that for a non-computerized reputation economy?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470756/#Comment_470756" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-18T09:02:23+00:00" title="March 18, 2018  9:02AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, however I think it has the same problem as the Warden.

Your current reputation <i>level</i> as determined by your rep point track (effectively a social class or wealth bracket) determines what sort of services and equipment you routinely, legally have access to, on a big ol' equipment table. So, for example, you need reputation level 4 to acquire small spacecrafts and level 6 for large spacecrafts. These are actually just the "wealth" rules from (IIRC) <i>Mouse Guard</i> and a number of other games: you might well make it so that you have to roll dice to get something especially significant, or that your rep goes down if you "stretch it" (such as commandeering <i>multiple</i> large spacecrafts at rep level 6) - this way, rep <i>does</i> double up as a (game) currency.<br/>The above is, of course, an abstraction. In character, nobody's actually keeping track of your rep points. What happens in the fiction is, word of mouth goes by and people speak your name with increasing admiration. Some people are friends with or owe favors to people who personally owe you one, others are just eager to do you a solid for free because they like you, admire you, or think it's good for their business to be associated with you.<br/>You can track reputation separately within separate societies. The rules of the game don't care whether there's actual exchange of in-fiction currency involved, or it is a gift-economy society, or the strictest feudalism, whether these people write down their debts and dues or just have long memories... you can describe it however you wish, and probably describe it differently for different societies, while using the same abstract framework to keep track of everything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470807/#Comment_470807" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-19T16:47:10+00:00" title="March 19, 2018  4:47PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" rel="nofollow">ghostwhistler</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> "Patron offers you the job to retrieve the magic sword, he'll pay you X rep"</p></div></blockquote>\nIf it works like currency, it's currency. Since retrieving the sword benefits only the patron, it cannot give true reputation, only a transfer of credit from the patron to the freelancers. At the most exotic end of the spectrum, the patron could offer special personal rights and privileges rather than money or common goods and services, such as a membership or rank in some organization (e.g. the position of "master of the carnival" for next year, with all the accompanying sex and parties). It would still not be a form of reputation, because if it were the character would be forbidden from giving it away.<br/><br/>Reputation, by definition, comes from the public. Retrieving a magic sword, if widely known, would certainly earn characters a great reputation as competent, lucky and reliable adventurers, but this reputation doesn't have obvious economical consequences beyond advertising who should get future paid adventuring missions. <br/>What reputation can earn, without a true socialist system, is some public resource that is granted to a worthy person with the expectation that they'll use it for the public good:<br/><br/>- a license to trespass anywhere and/or to plunder abandoned sites<br/>- temporary use of the child-size chainmail suit from the Baggins estate (while the war lasts)<br/>- invitation to join a secret society of patriots <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470809/#Comment_470809" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-19T17:16:57+00:00" title="March 19, 2018  5:16PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2018 5:20PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, yes, but <i>what if</i> a strange scifi society determines resource distribution by reputation instead of tracking currency? How would that work? That's the question.<br/><br/>With computers it's simple to imagine, as we basically have all the systems for doing it already. A computerized reputation economy could e.g. give you one credit each month for every "smiley" you have from other users at the end of the month. Essentially, every citizen gets to give one free credit to every other citizen every month if they want to, but only one credit to each. The shares would track reputation pretty closely, I would think. You could even have negative rep: pay one credit each month to central planning for every frowny you get.<br/><br/>(The credits are then used to buy services, similar to money. Perhaps they're fundamentally resource credits, you can trade them in to the central planning in exchange for electricity or computer cycles or oxygen - or you can trade them with other users for other services. The prices fluctuate because the amount of credits in the system fluctuates. And you can always, instead of trading credits, trade in popularity: give others stuff for free, and the only thing they need to do in exchange is to give you that extra bit of popularity, which will then produce you one credit per month in perpetuity, or until you do something to make that person remove their support.)<br/><br/>The tricky part is doing something like that without an ubiquitous computer network to track who likes whom among the citizens. That's where the various attempts at simplification come in: if everybody carries their own credit books to track who likes them, or if the likes are logged during periodical polling as in democratic government structures, it all becomes much simpler.<br/><br/>As for the "rich" guy who gives you a job in the reputation economy, surely that guy's "rich" in the sense that he's got lots of friends willing to give rep? So what he does is, he promises to invite you to his podcast after you do the deed for him, and as per the use metrics he can pretty much guarantee you X rep once you tell the adoring public about the nice thing you did for Mr. popular guy. A true reputation economy would run on transactions like that, people piggy-backing off each other's popularity, trying to get into the right circles, rather than somebody just paying you some credits for doing something for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470815/#Comment_470815" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-19T19:40:55+00:00" title="March 19, 2018  7:40PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's easier to figure out a system as complex as needed for the game, and no more complex than that.  I've been gearing up to run <i>Red Markets</i> recently, which is an economically sophisticated game, and it has a reputation system based around characters getting good and bad reputation "spots" which make it easier or harder to negotiate the next job on favorable terms.<br/><br/>Since the entire game is built around the process of negotiating jobs, doing them and getting paid, the reputation system feeds back very nicely into the main rules without becoming a mini-game of its own.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470950/#Comment_470950" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-22T08:47:00+00:00" title="March 22, 2018  8:47AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Given the social niche that is being inhabited, and the rejection of capitalist resource distribution, I'm not sure why your outsiders have opted for a reputation economy over something like anarcho-communism as their economic model.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
