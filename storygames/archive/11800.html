Have you ever had one of your players praise you about the job and effort you're making? Say something that makes you know you are actually going in the right direction?<br/><br/>Or maybe quite the opposite: Some moment that made you realize you were doing it all wrong? That you needed to re-think the way you were doing things?<br/><br/><br/><b>My Case:</b><br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11028" rel="nofollow">In this thread</a> (none of you guys paid any attention to T-T) I talked about how I've been trying to make the stories in games I ran more emotionally complex and compelling.<br/><br/>The affirmation of my tactics actually paying off came just a few days ago when the female player from that game said "You know, after that session, when I got into the car I was still feeling guilt about what happened in the game". And that felt just so great; to see that all the effort I'm making is actually bringing results! God, I just can't describe it!<br/><br/><i>And!</i><br/><br/>My personal moment of failure as a GM came long before I even started comming to these forums, let alone played anything that wasn't DnD.<br/><br/>After the first session of a campaign of Eberron I wanted to run I had my brother tell me something among the lines of "Man, you really need to make preparations for your game, this was boring as hell" Granted he was being an asshole... I came to the realization I just wasn't making the game entertaining for my players. This moment was good in itself because it was then that I decided to make some research into the RPG world and, a few years later, I find myself now with a better understanding of what i want out of a game, how to get it and when to leave my own desires for the good of the players.<br/><br/>And all this never sacrificing the enjoyment of the players nor my own.<br/><br/>Anyway!

I'm just putting that out there right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy highlights as a 'good' GM: Running a campaign of Deliria, wherein the players succeeded in doing something horrible, then watching the look of mortified guilt that settled on to their faces. I was very worried I'd lose a few players that night due to the nature of the disaster. I didn't. They kept coming back for more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you all know, I run games through a meetup club I help organize. My games often fill up within 24 hours of being posted, have a waiting list generally attached to them, and when players sit down at my table, I often hear: "I've heard your an awesome GM. Everyone talks about how good your games are!" <br/>\n<br/>\nMy highlights as a 'bad' GM: Running players through a dungeon in D&amp;D and having, I thought, a pretty straight forward puzzle solving area. It took two hours for them to figure out the name of the god was the element they were associated with. I didn't give clues or anything beside the obvious "This god's statue is in a room covered in ice..." and that the end of the puzzle demanded to be named. So the players felt tired and irritated after two hours of having me describe each statue and room in highest detail over and over again at their bequest. I should've helped the players out more, but I didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nRunning a game of Dread and letting the players fight amongst themselves using the Jenga tower instead of focusing on the creatures after them. The game ended up without atmosphere, unless you count B-movie action. One of my players was insistent he steal the girl (another player) by killing her brother (another player) and then riding off with her in the sunset. She didn't want to. So it became a race on horseback away from each-other. *sighs*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263676/#Comment_263676" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-23T09:25:02+00:00" title="March 23, 2010  9:25AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>I was the third highest rated GM in the RPGA in the UK and the only one in the top 5 who wasn't a committee member.</blockquote>\nSpeak to me of this rating system.

I had been going a little over-the-top with powerful beings lately, so they really expected him to be there, but when they opened the sarcophagus, it was empty. I think one of the players got the chills from the thought that the ancient one was already awake and walking about. There was still a lot of writings on the walls, so they expected at least some information, though none of them understood it yet.<br/>\nThen a Justicare (clan "inquisitor") showed up, told them he was here to deal with it and that they should have a talk somewhere nicer. When they were driving off in his jeep, they heard explosions behind them and the whole site collapsed as they drove off. It was so priceless to see their expressions when they realized that "deal with it" didn't mean "gather information and find him", but "destroy any evidence and silence anybody who saw it".<br/>\n<br/>\nSuck:<br/>\nFar too many. Worst was when I tried to adapt the story of a book as a quest, but didn't realize that this made for a prime example of railroading and sightseeing without any real freedom of action. Worse, I took the book itself as notes, so I was practically reading it while DMing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bartmoss" title="bartmoss"><img alt="bartmoss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bartmoss">bartmoss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264539/#Comment_264539" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-30T13:43:54+00:00" title="March 30, 2010  1:43PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Rock<br><br>I realised GMing was something I enjoyed more than playing and knew I was doing it right back in the early 1990s when one of my players in my CP2020 game pointed a gun at two NPCs, they gave up immediately, scared witless at having this gun up close in their face. They talked, they begged, they told the PC what he asked and they fled...the player then says ... "cool you mean these guys are not just fodder to kill off...!" then at the end of the session he says to me "You know I just realised this is the first game I ever played in which I can tell each NPC apart and know they have their own desires and agendas and are not just there to serve me!"<br><br>More recently just this weeked recieving a text message from one of my players that said (I paraphrase) "This game has fired my imagination like no other...please more more more"...this is praise beyond imagining.<br><br>The Bad.<br><br>Realising my players are fidgeting, reading books, talking to each other...I go off on a tangent and no one notices...I state "ok this game is over"...my players cheer!!!! <br><br/>Sitting down in the GM chair the three players look at me...their faces tell me something is wrong..."What started as this cool dark future game has now turned into some sort of cheesy supers game....you really jumped the shark there and we are begging you...please please stop...no more"                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
