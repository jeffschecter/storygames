I haven't talked about it, because I don't know how. But let me just get this off my chest:<br/><br/>I find the writing very bad. It's evocative in places - but there's no clear voice there, it hasn't been properly edited, and there are some eyesores - like naming a rule "That's retarded!" Reading the text left me annoyed.<br/><br/>The game may be wonderful - I think it would be hard not to make it work: The concept is strong, the episodal structure clear, and the flavor of theme + setting is good. <br/><br/>However, I want the game text to seduce me - not be an obstacle to overcome. (Right now it's like a girl who says she wants to have sex... but is wearing ill-fitting, ugly clothes and hasn't washed for a week).<br/><br/>That's the ugly. The good &amp; bad I'll only know after playing.

Yikes. Although, in all fairness, someone read it before it went to print.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I can really speak to all of Matt's other comments... they are after all his opinion... and he's more than welcome to express them. I appreciate Mark's comments, because ... yes... it was out of playtesting "that's retarded" was born. It could easily become "that's stupid" and might have the same charm of children "criticizing" each other's ideas.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to sample a few pages from the book, let me know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85129/#Comment_85129" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T16:20:00+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  4:20PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2007 4:28PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It took me a while to root about and find out what the game actually is.  The description at LuLu enticed me -- it's a setting that I think I'd love.<br/><br/>But the actual rules -- what the game is -- only gets a quick gloss. I'd love to hear more about the rules.<br/><br/>I tracked down the blog feed and I want to say I <i>loved</i> the art samples from the book. I usually think the art in RPG books is <i>bad</i>. But this stuff was <a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_ujsoaaa1v2w/RiXYzGvPjrI/AAAAAAAAAqA/dOQw0NzrFsQ/s1600-h/thetower.jpg" rel="nofollow">GOOD</a>!<br/><br/>By skimming some of the rules from the sample pages I thought -- "Hey, this looks strangely engaging. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I might be moved to tears playing it."<br/><br/>Jim, could you talk more about what the players actually <i>do</i> in play -- both in terms of narrative, but specifically rules and mechanics. There were all sorts of colorful fidley bits on the character sheet, but I don't know what they mean, how they interact with each other, what the mechanical point of play is. Could you describe this a bit.<br/><br/>Oh, and I liked the type-face and layout and the way the the PC is reference as "The Child." Once I saw that I thought, "Well, of course one of rules is <i>That's Retarded</i>!"<br/><br/>But in the same way <i>Dogs in the Vineyard </i>is a very different game than <i>My Life With Master</i> which is a different game than <i>AD&amp;D 3.5 </i>which is a different game than <i>Sorcerer</i> which is a different game than <i>Primetime Adventures</i>...<br/><br/><i>George's Children</i> is going to be a different game as well. So what is it? Can you tell me how the game is structured? What are the reward mechanics? What do the Players try to get done with mechanics?  How do the mechanics interact between Players/GM and so on....?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85142/#Comment_85142" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T16:45:49+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  4:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            chris, you want me to explain it on here or you just want to see a copy at gateway?<br/><br/>i'd be more than happy to do either                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85143/#Comment_85143" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T16:59:55+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  4:59PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welllllll...<br/><br/>If you explain it <i>here</i> -- then <i>this</i> whole audience gets to know more about your game.

The children and their point of view is everything.<br/><br/>Adults have been dead long enough that the world is in crisis, but short enough that some children remember something about them.<br/><br/>How children are born and when they go when they reach 13 is up to the storytellers.<br/><br/>Since it is a shard storytelling experience, everyone takes turns adding to the elements already created.<br/><br/>Told in three acts, the players take turns in age order (oldest first) detailing each of the following stages of the game<br/><br/>Act I: Breakfast<br/>Act II: Gossip<br/>Act III: The Journey<br/>Act IV: The The<br/>Act V: Bedtime<br/><br/>During Act I the children get one turn to introduce their character. Much like Dogs, they can either succeed or fail at the end of the scene and this will impact later scenes. Success in the game is denoted as gaining glory and failure is worry. This is true through every act. Breakfast also involves how they get food for the day.<br/><br/>Act II can be played one of two ways (although most everyone prefers the first version). Co-op or competitive rumors. Each child reveals a rumor about THE THE, being as convincing as they can about something that must be overcome. This is essentially how the plot of the game develops. But it changes every time you play. The only rules about the rumor is that it must be told as a THE. Children do not go to A park, they go to THE park. Therefore if a child says there's a monster in a forest somewhere, he is referring to THE monster in THE forest. In our first ever game, it was THE itchy. In the competitive version, the person with the most successes convinces everyone to go after his/her goal. In co-op, everyone votes or agrees.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, it always becomes about safety or luxury. Children want to get somewhere safe or fight some bad guys. OR, they want to reach a place where food is plentiful.<br/><br/>Act III is the journey. It plays like Act I, but continues around the table over and over again until one player reach give glory, which immediately starts Act IV. If anyone accumulates five worry, he or she ages one year and is out of the game. If the child is 12, he/she dies. The player still plays the game, but the child is not part of the story any longer. Act III does not have to be a journey. If the goal is to build defenses against an incoming gang of kids, then game play is still the same, but the players do not walk somewhere, but instead take turns preparing for the end.<br/><br/>Act IV is THE THE. This is free-form again. Although instead of gaining successes, the players spend the successes they have received so far, one at a time, revealing more and more about the climax.<br/><br/>Act V is Bedtime where the players discuss the fate of the other children at the end of the day based on the amount of Worry they have amassed.<br/><br/>Gameplay is about 3-5 hours depending on the number of players and the complexity of the story.<br/><br/>Character creation is a two-step process, pick a name and an age (between 7 and 12). No two children can be the same age.<br/><br/>Your Memory score is equal to your age. This represents a child's reality and how he/she interacts with it. Your Imagination score is 15 minus your age. This represents a child's perception of reality and ability to expand it.<br/><br/>Children have one goal each, to help frame the character. This has no mechanical value.<br/><br/>Children have strengths, which can be used once to reroll a failed die roll. Basically luck or hit points with names.<br/><br/>Determining success is a simple 50/50 ratio, with children bidding their attributes to determine how many dice they roll. The other children can increase the difficulty of a trial by spending their own imagination or memory. The more people spend, the harder it is for a child to get passed their objective.<br/><br/>Children either forge independence (gain Glory) or forge bonds (reduce the worry of others) during their turn. Since it is (sort of) a race to be the first child with five glory, the game can get a little competitive. Which is good. In the Lord of Flies version of the game, children play to last man standing, not a set number of Glory.<br/><br/>I think that's the easiest way to describe everything in the game.<br/><br/>The book also has rules for playing in a mutant or zombie-filled wasteland or to recreate AKIRA or something similar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85158/#Comment_85158" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T18:33:11+00:00" title="August  2, 2007  6:33PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><cite>Posted By: markv</cite><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>there are some eyesores - like naming a rule "That's retarded!"</blockquote>\ngive the game a try if you can get past your reaction - the sessions I played were always fun<br/><br/>The phrase is perfect if its meant to come from the mouths of children in America.

One YOUR turn, you frame a scene for yourself. And then set a Trial that you have to overcome. The other players can increase the difficulty of the Trial (one point per). You bid how much Memory or Imagination you want to spend to overcome the Trial. You roll dice equal to points spent (or flip coins or whatever). 50/50 chance of success on a single die/flip. If you get enough successes you get a point of Glory and describe your success. If you fail, you get a point of Worry and the player to your left describes your failure.<br/><br/>Haha.

Here's what I wrote about "That's retarded":<br/><br/>* I think that even though children from a specific culture are using that term today, it doesn't mean they will do so in a horrible post-apocalyptic world tomorrow. <br/>* Even if they do, the game is presumably meant for children from other cultures as well.<br/>* And at any rate, naming a rule after an offensive term is a conscious design choice. Why use that term, in this specific game? (I mean, you could conceivably name a rule "Nuke the fags!" in Twilight:2000, but it would seem jarring in the context of the game - while if Kill Puppies For Satan had a rule called "The Fuck Jesus Rule", it would make sense, sort of).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85183/#Comment_85183" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T00:43:41+00:00" title="August  3, 2007 12:43AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to ask the tough question:<br/><br/>Jim, you say you're a professional, and yet you wrote this game very quickly and didn't have it edited by anyone before publishing it.

I didn't go into this to be insulting, rude or offensive; if you read other stuff I've posted, here and elsewhere, you'll hopefully see that I generally aim to be diplomatic and don't post criticism easily.<br/><br/>I think what's happened here is that we're coming at this from widely different angles. On this forum, there has been a lot of debate recently about criticising games. Many people, myself included, feel that there's a culture among designers (I'm a game designer) of not telling each other what's wrong with each others' games, and that this isn't good for the games we make.<br/><br/>I've been writing based on the assumption that you understand <i>I'm a designer arguing from a customers' viewpoint</i>. I've thought of what I do as a sort of academic criticism: Asking pointed questions assuming that the answers will mostly show that the writers have thought through what they did, and sometimes show flaws in the process, for later improvement.<br/><br/>I see that I haven't been clear about this, and that some posts can be seen as unproductive attacks. I apologise for that. <br/><br/>I understand from both your posts that I'm seen as "random disgruntled customer posting angry stuff on message boards". I'm not. I'm a professionally published game designer and writer, with an understanding of both the writing and publishing process. However, you don't know that.<br/><br/>I understand from jim's whispers (which I wish he would have posted in public) that he doesn't wish to discuss the editing and writing of the game with me at this point. Since that was what this thread was about (it wasn't meant as a general information thread about the game, but quickly drifted there), I'm bowing out of the public debate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85207/#Comment_85207" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T03:23:36+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  3:23AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (See this thread for more context on the "criticising games on this forum" thing: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3774" rel="nofollow">Guide to Talking Bad About My Games</a>)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonHodgson" title="JonHodgson"><img alt="JonHodgson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonHodgson">JonHodgson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85221/#Comment_85221" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T04:40:25+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  4:40AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the first post was really good.

That's not a fair nor productive line of questioning in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nCriticism of the actual game, and the book which contains it are more than welcome.  The first post provoked some good discussion betwen me and jim yesterday. Your questions today just had us saying "now that's crossed the line into personal stuff". Of course that's a subjective line, but if you're going to tread near it you are risking crossing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hey, apology accepted, we're all good and understand one another.

That's unprofessional. How do you justify charging me money for your product?</blockquote>\nAnd suddenly that's an inference of Jim' character?  <br/><br/>No, it's not. (Though I might be able to see how you guys read it that way.)<br/><br/>The more important point for me (and I had the same question raised in my own mind when I read comments on the George's Children blog) is Jim saying, " We did this book for charity. That means we worked for free," to justify what, apparently is a book that needed better proof-reading. And then, on this site, Jim wrote: "It's for charity. All of it. How can we justify or afford an editor? We've already lost time and money on this project."<br/><br/>Now, as Jim has pointed out, proof reading your own material is <i>very</i> tough.<br/><br/>But guys..<i>. that doesn't cut it.</i><br/><br/>No one is allowed to say, "Because I'm doing this from the goodness of my heart, the quality will be less than what I normally do."<br/><br/>You rope someone in to volunteer time to proof it. Or you get three non-pros to read it and aggregate their red-marks.  (That would probably catch most of the mistakes.)<br/><br/>You do understand, Jim, that saying, "Hey, I was defending this guy pro bono, so of course I wasn't at the top of my game before the judge," doesn't make much sense?<br/><br/>Jim and Jon, if you want to keep putting yourselves in the corner of defending against personal attacks, that's your choice. But that's dodging the real issue here: Matthijs paid real money for the product, charity or not. And it's a product that represents the work you guys did, charity or not. Now, I haven't seen the text, he has. And he seems to be saying there's enough editing to be done that it wasn't ready to go out.<br/><br/>Charity or not, that's a valid criticism. Charity is not excuse. Good will can <i>never</i> be an excuse or it demeans good will. <br/><br/>Now, Matthijs, you now have the answer to your question. You wrote: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>I'm going to ask the tough question:<br/><br/>Jim, you say you're a professional, and yet you wrote this game very quickly and didn't have it edited by anyone before publishing it. That's unprofessional. How do you justify charging me money for your product?</blockquote>\nJim replied:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>t's for charity. All of it. How can we justify or afford an editor?<br/><br/>We've already lost time and money on this project.</blockquote>\nThat's it. You may not like the answer. (I don't.)<i> But there it is</i>. Short of brow-beating him into saying, "Hey, I was wrong. I should have treated this project with the same professional standards I bring to any other project," nothing is going to change on this front.<br/><br/>You asked. He answered.<br/><br/>To be honest, I don't think Matthijs <i>attacked</i> Jim personally. But I do think Jim <i>revealed</i> something about himself personally. He might not like having been put in that position where he had to do that. But that's a different matter.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85281/#Comment_85281" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-03T07:59:20+00:00" title="August  3, 2007  7:59AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2007 7:59AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jim,<br/><br/>You wrote:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite><br/>There is no GM.

I read the comment as "there's a lot of grammatical errors an editor would have corrected." Is that what was meant?

There are two typos that I remember noticing on the pages I looked at ("then" instead of "than", and a singular/plural error). I am doubtful that this is unprofessional. Any book has to have a limit at which point you send it to press, and there will be typos for sure.<br/><br/>I think it looks to have been "edited" in the sense of content -- it has been arranged in order, with I'm guessing parts added and omitted from an initial text. I would say that Jim has taken a critical view of the order of the book and what is to be included. I am guessing this as it looks a coherent text to me. Maybe an external editor would have asked questions that didn't occur to Jim, or maybe not.<br/><br/>I also think it has been "edited" in the sense that typos have been spotted and fixed, and I would say some proof-reading had been done. I think this because otherwise there would be far more errors. However, Jim probably did it himself and, of coures, you have a harder time spotting your own errors. Would someone else looking at it have helped?<br/><br/>Here's the deal. I would take someone who does this as a professional "rushing" it through and giving it a look over only a few times over a non-professional labouring away intensively for far longer. That is my experience.<br/><br/>What would my ideal be? A professional labouring away intensively for far longer, of course, but often circumstances dictate that this option is not possible (either financially or physically).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85678/#Comment_85678" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T16:21:53+00:00" title="August  5, 2007  4:21PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2007 4:29PM by jim pinto.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the posts, guys.<br/><br/>In general, I think you're going to find typos.

Which makes a lot of Chris responses about professional conduct and proof reading off target. I'm unclear at the moment as to whether rushing is really an issue. Professionally edited games have some typos. I understand from Jim that he is proud of the game. That it is the game he wanted to create. That is not an editing issue (except as you pointed out, editors can sometimes change writer's minds with new perspectives). That's a design issue.

But I'm going from Jim's words, not Matthijs'.<br/><br/>If there aren't a lot of typos, Jim should just say, "I don't think you're correct in this assessment. Could you please back that up."<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85687/#Comment_85687" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T18:12:49+00:00" title="August  5, 2007  6:12PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2007 11:17AM by jim pinto.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the record.<br/><br/>I spoke with Matthijs in private.<br/><br/>I did not agree with all of his assessments.
