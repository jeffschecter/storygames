<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1346" rel="nofollow">Tony's Discussion</a> brought to mind a concept I have been noodling over for a couple of weeks.  That is the level of effort that go into the various tasks associated with a (role-playing) game session. _AND_ the lengths "we" go to in order to simplify each of them for the responsible parties.<br/><br/>I have extended notes on this - apparently at home on my desk - so I will attempt to re-create my thoughts from memory.<br/><br/>The tasks to a game, from my perspective, can be divided into: Mechanics Definition, Setting Definition/World Building, Character Definition/Generation, Story or Session Design/Prep.  I see these as forming almost a Hierarchy of Design or a Hierarchy of Labor.<br/><br/>Mechanics Definition typically occurs once for a given "game".  A designer, whether a faceless person at the front end of the game supply chain or your in-house tinkerer, decides on the basic mechanics.  They may get house-ruled in play, but essentially, the bulk of the work is done once (or at least very rarely).<br/><br/>Setting or World Building typically occurs once per "campaign" (many campaigns can be played given a set of mechanics), but will likely be a continuous process in reaction to the players.  Setting Design may occur with Mechanics Design, in-house by the "Game Master", or collaboratively by the play group.  Once a campaign starts, the setting is unlikley to get revamped completely, but different Settings may be used by the same group using the same mechanics. <br/><br/>Character Generation is done at least once per player.  It may be done individually, in collaboration with the Game Master, or as part of a group design process.  Individual characters may evolve in play, new characters may be introduced, but rarely are specific individuals re-designed from the ground up.<br/><br/>Session Preparation occurs before EVERY session to some degree or another.  It is largely the responsibility of the Game Master, though in GM-less games all players may be expected to come to the session with ideas and inspirations to help drive play forward.  A sub-task of Session Prepartion can be Encounter Design with one or more Encounters occurring within a Session.  <br/><br/>(As I type this up, I realize it makes many assumptions based on 'traditional' games.  Some or all of which have already been challenged either conceptual or in practice by individuals who are part of the larger 'independent' game community.  I will proceed, however, with that understanding.)<br/><br/>END OF PART I<br/><br/>In Part II, I will discuss how the frequency of a task makes implications upon the complexity of the task and vice versa.                </div>

                            PART II<br/><br/>As a general rule, the more often a task is done, the more desirable it is that it be simplified or automated.  Conversely, if a task is rarely done, it makes sense to spend more time and effort on that task to be certain it is done properly.<br/><br/>To take an example from outside of gaming, in my real job, I am an analytical consultant and perform a wide range of tasks over the course of the year.  The simplest and most repetitive of these tasks is the generation of some 1400 reports, all identical except for the data criteria that feeds them.  During my first year at the task, it was highly manual, but I have in the three years I've been at it, created an automated process that takes what was several weeks of work and reduces it to a few days.<br/><br/>At the other extreme, I conduct data mining on a massive databases and generate original analyses and presentations based on my findings.  These analyses are often unrequested intially and I spend a great deal of time, not only doing the data mining and analyses, but also crafting the message and the delivery format for the results.<br/><br/>So lets go back to Gaming:<br/>From my perspective, one of the most frequent tasks involved in the actual running of a role-playing game is Session Preparation.  Everytime you sit down to play, some degree of session prep has to be done.  This suggests to me that I would want to endeavor to make this process as simple as possible for those involved.  Personally, as non-gaming demands on my life have increased, I have leaned more and more toward games that require less and less of my time outside of a game session.<br/><br/>Next in my proposed hierarcy is character design. This occurs, in general, less often than session prep, at least once per 'campaign' and maybe more often depending on rate of lethality, number of characters per player, and the like.  There is a nod toward the relative frequency of char gen in more 'traditional' game systems like d20 or StoryTeller games in that they have classes, clans, or the like to get players started.  More 'independent' games often simplify this by allowing more free-form character definition, or as an example, CAPES, quick and intuitive char gen.<br/><br/>Setting Design, while a continuous evolution, occurs essentially once per campaign.  This suggests that a great deal of time and care can be put into the process, to get things 'just right'.  Now I am not advocating doing all of the work up front, necessarially, but that unless there is a reason not to, paying careful attention to continuity, consistancy, and the like.<br/><br/>Finally, at the top of the chain, is mechanics design.  Now, I will admit to bias.  I am a numbers guy by inclination, and a mechanics fiend by choice.  However, since the basic mechanics of a game essentially get designed once and are effectively locked down when a printed copy of the game gets into someone's hands, they really need to be right the first time.  What "right" means may vary, for example, realism is not for everyone, but they should be complete and accurate to the designer's vision.<br/><br/><br/>From my perspective, alot of the games I associate with this community actually follow this hierarchy.  They tend to be mostly 'rules' with only the minimum amount of setting to support them.<br/><br/><br/>END OF PART II<br/><br/>In Part III, I actually ask some questions.                        </div>

                            PART III <br/><br/>I realize this is somewhat of a simplification (as all summaries, by thier nature, are) and that each process I broke out informs the others.<br/><br/>I also acknowledge that several 'independent' games, CAPES and PTA immediately spring to mind again, have worked to streamline the more frequent tasks.  But my question is simply, what other things can be done to simplify things like Session Prep to minimize the Social Footprint of a game?<br/><br/>In what ways can the natural interplay between players be used to develop the next session with minimal off-session effort?  Is there a way to communicate these ideas in our games to help the customer with these processes?<br/><br/>Is my hierarchy completely off-base?  Or more importantly, are there ways to turn it on its ear that will make for fun and interesting role-playing experiences?<br/><br/>That's all from me for now,<br/><br/>Blue                        </div>

                            Session Prep benefits from specific guidelines-- a series of steps.  For me, Dogs in the Vineyard town generation is easy, because you follow along as prompted-- when you reach the end, you're ready to go.  You don't have to wait for inspiration-- the various steps prompt you, creating inspiration.<br/><br/>PTA should also make prep easy; the "next week on" should give the GM core scenes to prepare.  Beyond that, you don't need much more than a general idea as to each character's story arc, a few general filler/transition ideas, and the scene you'll kick the next episode off with.<br/><br/>The general case, <a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2006/02/flag-framing_03.html" rel="nofollow">Flag Framing</a>, can also focus prep, though I prefer hard, specific flags to guessing among all the entries on a complex character sheet.                        </div>
