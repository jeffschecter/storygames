The GM let us have a few magical items as we were doing a higher-level playtest. I was at a loss for what to take, save for a dress-vest that turns me invisible. The GM offered a necromantic blade, so I took that. It basically heals my damage a bit against bloodied foes. When I pull it from its sheath, from the sheath spills what looks to be like dry ice gas, but black**. <br/><br/>Anyway, I got a chance to use the blade. Then the GM offered, "Okay, the blade (since all magical objects are sentient) will refuse to obey you until you take the life of an innocent."<br/><br/>Alrighty, since my dudette is a dark heroine, I figured that was simple enough: Chuck the blade, it's Over. It wasn't a pull that I'm inclined to act upon at all.<br/><br/>But, I was looking for other suggestions, things that would make a hero hold on to a necromantic blade. Sorcerer-style "Needs" that wouldn't make me as a player go, "Nope, don't need it then (pitch)". Or behaviors or something that WOULD make me want to keep it beyond its terrible price.<br/><br/>One further consideration is this: My character immediately determines that this dark blade is far more Real than she imagined, and thus is not interested in feeding it. However, because of its power, she wants to go further and destroy it so that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands! ...But it's a very difficult task to destroy such a blade, like it would be the basis of an adventure. <br/><br/>Other thoughts?<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>** My other thought was that when you fully withdraw it from the sheath, is that the song "Yakkity Sax" streams from the blade endlessly. <span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-ZnHmskwqCCQ?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHmskwqCCQ"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZnHmskwqCCQ/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382692/#Comment_382692" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T15:04:27+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  3:04PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What does it's refusal to obey you entail?<br/><br/>If you ditch it, it'll make whatever sucker ends up with it, kill folks you care about, right?

A powerful axe that was cursed such that the wielder was required to take a life with it like every 4 hours, if I recall correctly.<br/><br/>I talked to the GM about it. I said "If you REALLY want me to start assassinating PCs each game night at around 5 am, I'm totally up for that. But I should warn you in advance that such things often don't go over well with players in a game like this, which isn't advertised as being heavily PvP."<br/><br/>He retconned and gave me something less powerful and not cursed.<br/><br/>If I were you, I'd take the same approach. I'd look around the table at the other players and say "These look like a nice batch of innocents. So we're gonna go dark with this, hmm?"<br/><br/>If a GM wants to implode his game, let him do so (with fair warning) and let it become a learning experience for him.<br/><br/>I often play a little dark and back-bitey in games. But I purposely do so without adding bloodthirsty into the mix. If I do bloodthirsty, I make sure it's outward-facing. Doing back-bitey and bloodthirsty requires a special social contract up front.<br/><br/>(And I played in a game that supposedly had that social contract. But it still fell apart when the PvP got heated. It's REALLY hard to do heavy PvP plus heavy consequences in what is meant to be a long campaign game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382746/#Comment_382746" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T20:53:57+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  8:53PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How is it determined if the person you slay with the sword is innocent?

Now shut the hell up already."<br/><br/><br/>But yeah, I'd go with RobMcDiarmid's plan: ask the GM and other players directly whether they really want a character slaughtering innocent people, and suggest that it would be less of a pain the ass for everyone if the blade's only desire was less distasteful (and less likely to ruin the game?)...especially for what seems to be a fairly limited, small-scale reward. I mean, if it was healing your damage a LOT when you hit bloodied opponents, or healing it a bit all the time, or outright killing bloodied dudes on a hit, or giving you teleportation, then maybe having to perform an otherwise pointless act of cold-blooded murder out of frickin' nowhere with no other alternative would be a fair price to pay.

In that case this isn't an inflexible rule you're facing, it's a demand. You should consider it as a first offer in negotiations. The fact that you're not willing to provide the sword's first demand is not sufficient reason to break off negotiations.<br/><br/>Make your interaction with the sword into mid-to-long-term funny and creepy drama as you learn about the blade, the blade learns to respect you, and you try to convince it to change its mind. Why is it hot for innocent death? Is there something else that might satisfy it? If you're a "dark" hero (whatever that means, I never got it), then presumably you might be willing to provide the blade with other "evil" titillation of some sort. Or maybe it has some ancient enemies it hates enough, or maybe you could threaten to sink it in the sea if it doesn't obey you. The way this sort of thing would go down in your average fantasy story would be that the sword gets convinced by your sufficient baddassitude along the way when you do something sufficiently ruthless for suitably heroic reasons that have nothing to do with taming the sword.<br/><br/>As for why your character would care enough to bother with this, that's trickier - and well addressed by other suggestions. Personally, I'd chuck it, just like you say, unless there was some reason to keep it out of enemy hands or something like that. The rpg systems where a magical sword will actually, mechanically be a deal-breaker worthy of murder are few and far between. I haven't played this system, but a bit of magical healing sounds like a bullshit power in exchange for that sort of evil sacrifice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382835/#Comment_382835" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T17:54:16+00:00" title="June 19, 2012  5:54PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it creepy blade?

Say that when your quest is done (when you reach 10th level) you will offer yourself to it (it would have to agree to offer you more as it increased in power). Pretty much selling your soul to the devil in return for its powers.<br/><br/>If the sword is a powerful magical receptical for a spirit - go get yourself a better spirit and exorcise this one.<br/><br/>Plunge it into a vast creature such as the behemoth which won't even notice it.<br/><br/>Keep it and vow to destroy it. Result - personal quest.<br/><br/>Edit: Accounting for Taste did one of these already.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
