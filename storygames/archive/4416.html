I'm trying to put together a list of traits which are appropriate to the French Revolution era, and which fall under the categories Strength, Charm, Combat and Morality. Your assistance in a little brainstorming exercise wuold be much appreciated.<br/><br/>Just to clarify, by the way, Strength, at present, can either represent your physical strength or mental/emotional strength, the stat you would use if you were to stand firm against a sea of slings and arrows, and perhaps, by opposing end them. This is currently a... thing I'm wondering about whether I want to define differently.<br/><br/>Morality would be those nice little things like Truth, Justice, Honour, Loyalty, and all those other things the Thundercats upheld.<br/><br/>Comments on the traits themselves, ill defined as they are, would also be welcome. I may come back looking for the same thing, but with naval galleons and/or highschool football later.<br/><br/>Cheers, your assistance is much appreciated,<br/><br/>Shevaun                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99683/#Comment_99683" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T05:14:16+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  5:14AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you could go with "Libert\xc3\xa9, \xc3\xa9galit\xc3\xa9, fraternit\xc3\xa9," French for "Liberty, equality, brotherhood." <br/><br/>Fraternit\xc3\xa9 would work for Charm and \xc3\xa9galit\xc3\xa9 would work for Morality.

Premise is this: I'm trying to make a system which can be used in a lot of genre settings. The game, in brief, is based on the idea of people before and during a time of crisis, firstly sitting around telling anecdotes about their pasts to pass the time before the proverbial hits the fan (and in doing so making their characters), and then taking on the impending doom-type affair.<br/><br/>The stats were being generic because I wanted to be able to use them in any such situation, from French Nobles sitting around in a darkened chateau, listening to the mob roaring outside and knowing that sunrise brings their doom, to the British Naval galleon that knows it will catch up with the nasty privateer come daybreak, to the high school football team on the bus to the big game, joshing around with each other but all the while knowing that the final is coming up in a few hours. For now I'm concentrating on the French nobles, because its the idea I have set most firmly in my head.<br/><br/>The Traits I'm looking for are to be specific to the individual setting though. So while "Superbuff!"(strength) and "Amazing long pass"(Combat?) might be suitable trait for the highschool football variant, "Master duellist"(Combat) would be more appropriate to the French Revolution game, or "Richest Man in Burgundy"(Strength/Charm) or "Seductive Beauty"(Charm). As you can see, I'm all about the lame traits right now though, which is where I thought you guys would be able to help me. I plan (at the moment) to have a set of traits to choose from for the players to buy for their characters during the course of the game. I'm not sure, but it seemed to work better if the pool was limited, and the traits presented on little cards. I'm still working on this though, so seeing what sort of traits people can come up with might clarify how it'll work in my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99869/#Comment_99869" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T19:32:53+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  7:32PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 28, 2007 7:33PM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But "Libert\xc3\xa9, \xc3\xa9galit\xc3\xa9, fraternit\xc3\xa9" are great!

The original game concept kinda included them as a penalty for it you failed to get the positive trait you desired; you'd be awarded an appropriate negative trait in place of the positive one you'd been boasting about.<br/><br/>At the moment though, I'm flitting between the original idea, which was much more GM-ful looking, and the current idea which is GM-less, which is what I wanted all along. So making situations where people have positive traits to throw at the plot things and make them go away seems about right.

If someone has negative traits, they're already making life tough for themselves and deserve a break. If someone has positive traits, they deserve some karmic backlash.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100291/#Comment_100291" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T14:40:35+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  2:40PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I'm wondering whether it might not be better to let players write their own descriptors.

But seriously, yeah, its either going to go that way or with the preset descriptors, but the reasons for needing the list are basically so that I can have a nice simple game where people throw around cards and the play turns over quickly, without draining people's enthusiasms. I've seen a lot of games where people struggle to come up with a good trait and then feel bad about not using it, plus the cards keep it nice and light. Tell you what, I'll start a new thread to discuss my game concept. I just hope you guys don't pick on me too hard; I'm not used to this whole forum scene (as evidenced by my fluffed attempts at getting my point across above).<br/><br/>Shevy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
