This location happens to also be a stone's throw away from the fae's epic-sized Tree of Darkness. Action generally takes place at Mirkshire Regional High School and the surrounding residential area, as well as the neighboring fae realms.<br/><br/><b>The PCs (up until this point):</b><br/>\u2022 <b>Levi</b> (Werewolf played by Epidiah Ravachol) \u2013 poor trailer-trash boy raised by wolves, now on the football team and dating a ghost<br/>\u2022 <b>Ping</b> (Fae played by Julia Ellingboe) \u2013 centuries-old Seelie fae who is now playing at being human, and romantically entangled with several non-humans<br/>\u2022 <b>Seth</b> (Serpentine played by Emily Care Boss)  - rich Euro-trash bad boy who recently moved into the mansion on the hill, entrusted with his family's powerful dagger<br/>\u2022 <b>Olivia</b> (Ghost played by Meguey Baker) - angry 15 year-old who died in a car crash in the 1960s, now learning to let go of the past and embrace the present<br/>\u2022 <b>Six</b> (Hollow played by Kat Jones) - doll brought to life as a result of an irresponsible mother's wish, now embroiled in a small war over her affections<br/>\u2022 <b>Gerard</b> (Witch played by Vincent Baker) - teen witch kidnapped by the Goat God and made a general of the Unseelie army, in complicated relationship with Ping<br/>\u2022 <b>Terrifying Fake Gerard</b> (Ghoul played by Vincent Baker) - hungry doll with Gerard's memories in Gerard's skin who bites people and fell in love with Six<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2810" rel="nofollow">The Ongoing Actual Play</a><br/><br/><b>My Thoughts on the Ongoing Actual Play:</b> MC-ing <i>Monsterhearts</i> has been a truly liberating experience, as I feel like my job is mostly to be entertained by the ever-unfolding chaos, making sure the spotlight is evenly distributed and that the PCs encounter sufficient adversity. A few points about the way I do this:<br/>\u2022 I rely heavily on <b>love letters</b> at the beginning of the session to generate story kickers, and back off for most of the rest of the session. It turns out that this works \u2013 my modest written text at the beginning of the session unleashes consequences that ripple through the session and the sessions beyond it.<br/>\u2022 I don't have any Threats or other such jazz. Instead, I have a stable of NPCs with a few "best interests," and otherwise obey the Agendas and just keep the story feral. That appears to be sufficient in this case, especially given the size of the group. Also, I have a "season finale" event (the Wild Hunt), which maintains a long-term sense of anticipation and worry.<br/>\u2022 Each session is also secretly a food-saturated event, such that we are stuffing ourselves full of tasty morsels while our PCs sleep with and hit each other. I don't think we could go the full 4 hours at this kind of intensity without constant energy replenishment in this capacity.<br/>\u2022 I made transport something of a non-issue \u2013 the town is small enough that folks can run all over it in about 15-20 minutes. This makes for me not having to worry about silly things like temporal-spatial continuities and so forth. It also makes it more like a TV show, where the right characters seem to meet up at the right time. It also helps drive the action and romance like nothing else.<br/>\u2022 It's easy for all involved to watch supernatural high-schoolers fail. They're floundering through their identities, and thus there is no real <i>serious</i> player stakes in having characters fail or succeed in this particular genre. Whereas <i>Apocalypse World</i> has this kind of life-or-death feel hinging on every roll, the <i>Monsterhearts</i> rolls are suspenseful and juicy and just <i>wrong</i>, no matter where the dice land.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20the%20Quick" title="Jack the Quick"><img alt="Jack the Quick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20the%20Quick">Jack the Quick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386216/#Comment_386216" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T08:43:05+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  8:43AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I\u2019ve been really enjoying your AP reports, and I recently tried using love letters in my own games of Monsterhearts. They went over very well with both my groups, but there is a pitfall I ran into in building them. <br/><br/>They\u2019ve got to not just have the possibility of creating drama, but they must create drama regardless of the results of die-rolls. I had a number of my love letters have potentially interesting things happen (such as failing to summon a demon properly, not being able to complete a protection ritual on time, or spilling secrets all across a Serpentine\u2019s family) but in all three cases the player rolled really well, and this left their scenes\u2026 fairly flat. Do you have any advice on how to make love letters really sing?<br/><br/>Monsterhearts has been an awesome, both as a fun game and as a learning experience. One thing I really noticed while writing up my notes (as unfortunately I haven\u2019t been able to convince anyone else to take over note-taking duties) is that a whole lot of things happen in a session of Monsterhearts in contrast to a lot of other games I\u2019ve played. We blow through a whole pack of scenes.<br/><br/>My one major problem is that the game can drag unless you\u2019re really fierce with your scene framing. I\u2019ve noticed a tendency with myself as MC and the players to dwell on minutia and to stick to a strict chronological set of scenes, which can lead to very slow scenes, or very disjointed Hard Moves. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386250/#Comment_386250" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T14:15:38+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  2:15PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad you've been enjoying the AP reports.<br/><br/>Here's how I make the love letters work for me:<br/><br/>1. I read the last session's AP and ask myself: "What is up with Seth right now?" I answer the question to the best of my ability: "Seth's on a family mission against the fae, in love with Six but not actually sleeping with her, and has a creepy dagger he barely understands."<br/>2. I maneuver one of the four abstract 'Fronts' in my mind against the character. These Fronts are (most inelegantly): Fallout from Last Session, Stupid Mundane B.S., Creepy Supernatural Awfulness, Social Politics. So "Fallout from Last Session" would be that there are maybe some after-effects from engaging Seth's Darkest Self. "Stupid Mundane B.S." would remind him that he's a high-school student with homework and tests. "Creepy Supernatural Awfulness" is usually visions, portals, summonings, etc. "Social Politics" involves how other people get in your way sometimes.<br/>3. I come up with a straightforward opening text that both frames a scene and pricks the attention of the PC (meaning it's got to grab the attention of the player too!)<br/>4. Try to get them to roll on their "off" stat, if you can.<br/>5. Now the <b>guts</b> of the love letter: the three outcomes.<br/>A. The Full Success - How you can make this PC's victory A) give them a little (or a lot of) power to abuse, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> deepen/complicate a relationship with a fellow PC or C) impel them to take action or transform themselves. By all means, give them their success, but make it upset the power balance a little too, or at least give them a few benefits for winning and move on.<br/>B. The Partial Success - The PC has a mitigated victory, and the consequences usually express some fundamental issue with which the PC is grappling. It should also have a mechanical side. Think of the main currencies of the game \u2013 Conditions, Strings, Experience, Harm \u2013 as part of your picture. Offer them hard choices, but know which one of the two options the PC is likely to pick anyway.<br/>C. The Miss \u2013 I write down the miss consequences too because I don't want to have to invent a Hard Move on the fly while going around. Plus it's fun to see the players' expressions when reading them. This should be the kind of thing that the PCs really can't ignore. It should make them feel a real loss, but still get them excited about what potentially will happen.<br/><br/>Remember: if the outcomes that you're writing aren't already entertaining for you, don't write them down. If you don't feel like writing love letters for a session, don't do it. But then you've got more in-session framing work (as you said) to do at that point.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386251/#Comment_386251" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T14:34:43+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  2:34PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would add one piece of advice, which applies for both love letters and custom moves: design content that gives the players a chance to be awesome and clever, rather than designing content that proves how awesome and clever you are. Instead of writing "On a 7-9, you get what you want, but you sour on your relationship with Mara and gain the Condition <i>poisoner</i>" try something that lets the players navigate in interesting directions, like "On a 7-9, you get what you want, but you sour on one of your relationships. Which one? That person gives you a Condition."<br/><br/>That example isn't rock-solid, but the piece of advice: design content that makes the players feel awesome and clever when they engage it (even if their characters are getting torn apart by it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386256/#Comment_386256" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T15:53:22+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  3:53PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, keeping it open-ended somehow that keeps the character's dignity intact is the way to go.<br/><br/>Six unleashing Eight last session was a perfect example. Her love letter was:\n<blockquote>Dear Six,<br/><br/>You go off to create the extra version of yourself. It\u2019s a combination of concerted wishing and strenuous investment of your power.<br/><br/>Roll to hold steady.<br/><br/>On a 10+, you create an exact duplicate of yourself. Decide if you want to take another playbook or not.<br/>On a 7-9, you create a flawed version of yourself, meaning it is unstable in some fundamental way. Put a Condition on it.<br/>On a miss, you wish something terrible into existence, and it gets away from you.<br/><br/>In any case, Mark 2 experience.<br/><br/>Your doting MC - Evan<br/></blockquote>\n(She got to mark 2 experience because she wasn't there for most of the session.)<br/><br/>She totally missed the roll, and I tossed the Hard Move back to her. "What terrible thing do you wish into existence and which gets away from you?" Eight and her memory-stealing power came straight from the player, not from me.  Meanwhile, Six gets to maintain her awesomeness and cleverness, and has an invested enemy to take care of.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386297/#Comment_386297" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-03T08:30:58+00:00" title="August  3, 2012  8:30AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm speaking as a player here.<br/><br/>Love letters can be such a strong influence on the fiction (you are essentially framing them into a situation and its resolution over which the players have 0 control), that building in ways for it to be customized by the player is essential. So, very much ditto to Joe's and Evan's advice. <br/><br/>Also, being okay with the letters *not* having a strong effect on what folks do in game is important. When what you do does connect with the player's interests you'll feel it fire on all cylinders. When it doesn't, don't be afraid to let it drop. It can become another point of interest that may come into more focus later on. You're on a fishing expedition, just wait for the next bite. <br/><br/>And re: falling flat.Winning something simple is always nice. E.g. XP, some inside information, etc. The most fun I've had with loveletters in Monsterhearts has, of course, been when I've failed big on time. But it's nice not to have that kind of upset every time.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386300/#Comment_386300" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-03T08:51:41+00:00" title="August  3, 2012  8:51AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Recently I used a branching love letter for a PC who had been shot up, then missed a session.
