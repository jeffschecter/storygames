Would you help me out? <br/><br/>Don't worry, you needn't understand the rules. Here's a simplified version:<br/><br/><i>You need to overcome 5 obstacles to win.<br/><br/>Each time you try to beat an obstacle, you roll some dice, and there's about a 0.6 chance you'll succeed.<br/><br/>However, you also roll the <i>Danger Die</i>, and there's a 1 in 6 chance you'll spark an Alert.<br/><br/>Each Alert means you need to conquer <i>one more obstacle</i> to finish the game.</i><br/><br/>So, you see how this will work? It's quite possible (40% chance) you'll never roll an Alert. But, if you roll an Alert, you need one more roll to finish: making it likely you'll roll <i>another</i> Alert.<br/><br/>Hence, the more Alerts you roll, the more likely it is that you'll roll <i>even more</i> Alerts. (The rules reinforce this even more, by making you reroll things as you get more Alerts).<br/><br/>I like the idea of this. Either the thiefy job goes well (no alerts) or it goes <i>completely to fuck</i> (lots of alerts). The more trouble you're in, the more trouble you get into.<br/><br/>My problem is: is this fun? It's <i>totally possible</i> you'll play a game and get no alerts (40% chance, so just under half the time).<br/><br/>If I <i>wanted</i> to fix this, I could tweak the rules. But I quite like it as it is. Perhaps some jobs just go very well. What do you think?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97718/#Comment_97718" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T04:56:35+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  4:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a short game, right?

For example: "What do the engravings on the diamond say?".<br/><br/>So, if you do a perfect job, you have an option to answer the mystery with <i>another</i> thing to steal and <i>another</i> mystery. "The engravings identify a map in an ancient library. Where does the map point to?".<br/><br/>Does that make things any better? It means that, if you have a perfect job, you can move straight on to the next one.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97730/#Comment_97730" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T05:29:20+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  5:29AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that does make the perfect job more tasty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stevebarkeruk" title="stevebarkeruk"><img alt="stevebarkeruk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.collective-endeavour.com/files/pictures/picture-239.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stevebarkeruk">stevebarkeruk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97735/#Comment_97735" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T05:44:10+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  5:44AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could have an alternate ending where, if things go wrong, the thief can give up on the mission and the mystery is unsolved, leading to a different consequence; "The diamond is now in the hands of the local crime lord, what is he planning to do with it?" So the new mission is to infiltrate the crime lord's lair and eaves drop on a meeting with his henchmen, hopefully leading to another mission where you can pick up a bigger haul than just the diamond.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, maybe give the thief player the option to hide during the mission and wait for the alert to go down a little; they roll only the Blackguard dice in hiding mode and each footprint reduces the alert by 1.  To make this interesting, you could assign a time limit to the mission with each roll (normal or hiding) representing 15 minutes work or a half hour or whatever, with the mission having to be completed within a certain number of hours.  So when time pressure is on, the thief has to either risk it at high alert or run to filch another day, or if time allows they can play a tactical game by laying low for a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
