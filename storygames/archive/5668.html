(Formerly known as the "Title Game," but "Name Game" rhymes so it wins.)<br/><br/>Game designers come up with game titles way more often than they actually design those games. Sadly, many potentially awesomely titled games are lost in this process.<br/><br/>Six months ago, I started a brainstorming exercise: I come up with a title, you come up with a game concept. It can be a board game, rpg, card game, whatever. It can be just a theme, just a few mechanical ideas, but hopefully a little of both. The point is to keep things moving, not produce a perfect, complete game right off the bat. <br/><br/>Then you challenge me with a title of your own and we go back and forth until we can't go on any longer.<br/><br/>A few took up the gauntlet during the last game, but <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/605311.html" rel="nofollow">Fred Hicks and I</a> went back and forth for over a month coming up with dozens of game ideas. This eventually led to <b>Dinocalypse</b>, a new dinosaur-themed supplement for Spirit of the Century. See? This thing actually can produce some cool stuff.<br/><br/>I'm hosting a Name Game on my livejournal, where the branching comment structure can allow for multiple forking challenges and counter-challenges, but I'd also like to have an ongoing challenge on story-games with Andy's permission.<br/><br/>Let's follow the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5642&amp;page=1#Item_18" rel="nofollow">F1 Re: Esc</a> rules of etiquette since we don't have branches.<br/><br/>Fred's kicking things off with the title:<br/><br/><b>It's About Damn Time</b><br/><br/>To recap: The first poster on this thread will post a game idea based on Fred's title and then propose a title of her own. Someone else will post a game idea based on <i>her</i> title, and so on, until we plotz.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126750/#Comment_126750" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T05:36:02+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  5:36AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2008 5:38AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Its About Damn Time</b><br/>The demonic lords of various sins fight over the soul of a very bad person who has finally expired.

The game alternates between "muck around with the past" scenes and "hang out at the Factory" scenes. Resolution is card-based. Players spend cards to increase their chances of success in manipulating history; the cards that are spent then form a "Warhol Deck" from which players draw during Factory scenes to see how impressed Warhol is with their time traveling antics.

You are an astronaut-in-training, playing out that scenario. <br/><br/>This is a jeepform game inspired by Apollo 11, featuring heavy use of props. The goal is to prevent the Florida Keys Spacecrash through the clever use of random objects you have lying around your "space capsule" (ie, whatever room you're playing in.). Players can bring as many strange and unusual objects as they can find before the game, but every object must find a purpose in order for the crash to be prevented.<br/><br/>Complications arise with each attempt to repair the capsule, but can be diminished or reversed by having personal scenes between astronauts (ie, Dealing with each other's space madness), between the astronauts and Houston (ie, Explaining the various systems malfunctions), or between the astronauts and their loved ones (ie, I love you, Barbara.

On a player's turn, they can either (1) draw a card from the top of the deck, (2) blindly trade a card with one other player at the table, or (3) issue a challenge. To issue a challenge, the player takes two or more cards from their hand and lays them down in front of another player in a particular order of the player's choosing. That player must then say the words on the cards, in order, five times fast without erring. If the player fails to do so, they are knocked out of the game.
