What is it that made real people into real explorers? The rush of novelty; the glory of being "first"; the wealth that comes with new goods/places/products; the opportunity to experience new environments; the learning of previously-unknown information; the ability -- both in travel, and in an alien/hostile environment -- to test new equipment/inventions/philosophies; the ability to escape the restraints of stable/civil society.<br/><br/>Then, once you have your list of what makes exploring fun, go about making game systems that trigger the same responses in players. How do you make players hunt the keys of freedom, discovery, glory? How do you make them feel some semblance of what it must actually be like to set foot where nobody else ever has? How do you simulate the despair that the map will soon have no secrets, and elation of the discovery of a new frontier?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213245/#Comment_213245" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T15:30:05+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  3:30PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More exploration in the "literary-analysis" sense, I suppose. Not playing explorers, but playing characters in a story that, first and foremost, explores the setting. In this case, I'd probably identify the major drawing points as wonder, the thrill of discovering unsuspected awesomeness, the thrill of seeing the world from a different perspective that suddenly makes the mundane magical.<br/><br/>But I suppose, more to the point, what kind of game would you have if, instead of dealing with conflicts, it dealt with discovery?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213269/#Comment_213269" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T17:41:36+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  5:41PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well if instead of dealing with conflicts you dealt with discovery...you'd have to find a source of tension. Most people go with conflict because it's easy: conflict by its nature generates tension. Tension is fun, and without it you aren't really playing a game so much as collaboratively storytelling or something. <br/><br/>I imagine that in such a game, it would be important to set it somewhere unfamiliar both to the players and the characters. Since there shouldn't be much if any conflict, make the NPCs friendly or at least ambivalent. If someone isn't doing what you want, I'd think you'd probably be more likely to go do a fetch quest or trading sequence (to use video game terms) rather than fight them. The tension could perhaps come from time, i.e. the players need to get somewhere/find something/escape before the sun sets/the king dies/the door to the realm of nightmares is shut forever.<br/><br/>Or maybe the players rather than going on a traditional "adventure" are somewhere to build something. For example, perhaps the players have discovered a new and resource filled world, and now they have to explore, colonize, and use the resources of the place to build a thriving civilization. Plenty of inherent tension there with no actual conflict.<br/><br/>Anyways, good luck with whatever you end up doing. I think exploration is a really under-used genre in RPGs, it deserves more attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213270/#Comment_213270" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T17:42:34+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  5:42PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talk to Joshua A.

This reductionism reflects a culture that inflates aggression and competition while cultivating ignorance of other behavioral options. No narrative of any complexity can be built on or reduced to a single element. Conflict is one kind of behavior. There are others, equally important in any human life, such as relating, finding, losing, bearing, discovering, parting, changing.</blockquote>\nI think she has it right, and I got a lot from that thread. Yes, I agree, <em>tension</em> seems pretty critical to storytelling, but it says something more about us than story that we seem compelled to try to reframe all tension in terms of conflict. For instance, you could turn it around and frame all conflict in terms of exploration. I think many martial artists would certainly recognize a model of combat as two people exploring each other's strengths and weaknesses. Exploration, like conflict, has tension. In a conflict, the tension comes from the question, "Who will prevail?" In exploration, the tension comes from the question, "What will you discover?" and "What will you miss?" and maybe even "Will you find it in time?"<br/><br/>I don't mean to preclude conflict by this; rather, recast it. Instead of putting everything, including discovery, in terms of conflict, maybe turning that around, and putting everything, including conflict, in terms of discovery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213294/#Comment_213294" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T20:30:35+00:00" title="June 18, 2009  8:30PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you making up the setting yourself, prepping some beforehand and then as you go along, or are you riffing off some kind of established setting or specific guidelines?

The scope of the game (and therefore, the sort of things you can ask questions about) expands over time, using the questions as a pacing mechanic. At first you can only ask questions about the PCs' immediate environment, but eventually you expand the scope to include questions about local politics, the entire alien civilization, planets, and eventually the entire universe. The characters also develop but I can't remember how those mechanics work off the top of my head.<br/><br/>Edit: And hey, Quickstart rules I hadn't seen before!

I'm hangin' with family and didn't have time to write it out before.</p>\n<p>Like Shock: Xenon: relies heavily on carefully assigned authority. There is a single GM-style player called the World Player. It's that player's responsibility to play the world, describing what they see in their mind's eye at every opportunity. They play the background characters, creatures, the weather, and everything but the select sapient journeyers played by the remaining players. The World Player builds the world starting from a seed given by the players, systematically expanding the horizon as it's approached such that places and people share characteristics with the things they're close to, and fewer and fewer characteristics with things they're farther from.</p>\n<p>The remaining players give some seeds to create their home people and thereafter are responsible for their characters alone, voyagers in a big world. Whenever they look at something, the World Player tells them what they see. When they do <em>more</em> than look, they grab the dice in order to dominate, socialize, or learn. Success in any of these has specific, concrete fictional effects.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the World Player can pick up dice to throw in order to hurt, trap, or reveal the traveler. Again, there are specific fictional effects of these.</p>\n<p>Almost all results of the resolution system are fictional. You get dice for the people who you befriend, the things you learn, the capabilities you gain. If your traveler loses, they can't help anyone else until the fictional constraints under which they're working are relieved. That might healing, it might be being freed from a cell, it might be learning something.

That's become the primary tool of the World Player. As the explorers reach nodes, new ones are implied through their interactions. Those are added to the map.

I do think the structure of having a gamemaster (or "world player") is a good way to go, so that it is world exploration, not world building creating the illusion of exploration.<br/><br/>For Jason (and anyone else):<br/><br/>How about, not struggle without, but struggle within? I built an exploration game a while back (called <i>Bandele: Born Away From Home</i>) that involved characters having traits defined by emotions (represented by suits on cards) relating to a subject. Minor traits were built from one emotion, while major ones were built from two. As characters changed, they struggled with themselves to rewrite their traits (both in description and in card suits) for best advantage. Each change required some time to work through, rendering the trait unavailable until the struggle was over.<br/><br/>The thing about this is that the character is his or her own opposition in the struggle, freeing the character to choose to engage in non-conflicts with the world. Depending on how much influence traits have over character behaviour, and how much influence the world has on that struggle, becoming friendly is potentially as much a struggle as being unfriendly.<br/><br/>If the traits are rooted in cultural practice, then adopting a new culture is another possible form of internal struggle, one particularly appropriate to exploration.<br/><br/>Yes, I know this is a bit of a cheat, that it really hides the conflict within the character, but it does allow the flexibility in story that you desire. There is often a need for mechanics to both change existing traits and gain new ones. Taken in a different direction, if traits were disadvantages (or mixed advantages/disadvantages), then an mechanic to abandon such passions can reflect Le Guin's taoist character development.

I read over the quickstart rules, and I really like the whole questions thing. It's definitely something to think about.<br/><br/>Joshua: Thanks for your description; it sounds like an interesting game, and I look forward to playing it sometime. Your use of the word "horizon," and how the World Player plays, really set off some bells in my head, especially right after Daniel bringing up <em>Sign In Stranger</em> and its expanding scope of questions. That may be a way of defining the scene that really brings some interesting implications. It's given me something good to think about.<br/><br/>You said that it had rules for controlling verisimilitude. It sounds like the main control lies in having a single World Player. Does it have anything else for that, that I just missed?<br/><br/>So far as mechanics and fiction\u2014or, as Vincent might put it, clouds and boxes\u2014I don't know if I agree. I really like the work of an anthropologist named Tim Ingold. He's made a career breaking down Cartesian duality. Cartesian duality runs deep in our thinking, and has some really surprising implications. He never looked at RPG's, but I think I have to thank him for giving me so many examples that I think like this now. I think the distinction of mechanics and fiction follows from our own dualistic ideas. If anything, I'd rather focus on breaking down the distinction between mechanics and fiction at all.<br/><br/>Graham: That sounds like a pretty interesting mechanic, though I have to agree, so far as making a game about something other than conflict, it does seem like a bit of a cheat. I like it in your game! I just don't know about putting it in mine.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>I do think the structure of having a gamemaster (or "world player") is a good way to go, so that it is world exploration, not world building creating the illusion of exploration.</blockquote>\nI have a fascination with questions of perspective and engagement (which might also tell you something of why a game where discovery takes center stage would have so much interest for me). The idea of creating the world by perceiving and engaging with it holds a certain appeal to me all on its own, so I don't know if I'd necessarily place the illusion in the game mechanics, or in the perception of the fictional characters. Call me a dirty post-modern hippie.<br/><br/>Bill: Yes! That transformation, that chance to see the familiar world become unfamiliar, cool, even magical, keeps coming up for me, too, as one of the things I really like about this project. I think you've got it, I need to push that front and center. Maybe instead of abstract land types like I have done, I need to have players start with locations they actually know, and proceed from there.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>The trick in play becomes avoiding the tragedy of the commons, which is where the neat prisoner's dilemma mechanic could be reintroduced in a more pointed way.</blockquote>\nI don't know if I understand what you mean by that.

That transformation, that chance to see the familiar world become unfamiliar, cool, even magical, keeps coming up for me, too, as one of the things I really like about this project.

Could you elaborate?<br/><br/>First, let's envision the basic process of play. At the level of game mechanics, the game proceeds as players "transform" zones on the real-world map. Imagine you've agreed to play on a map of Pittsburgh, and someone gets to decide that play begins in what used to be Heinz Field. What does it look like now? Maybe just a semi-circular concrete spiral on the riverfront surrounding a few acres of garden-plots that the women of the tribe tend when their travels bring them there. Right now, that's all we as players know about the world.<br/><br/>At the level of the fiction, though, that's not necessarily the case, right? The characters we're playing are nomads; maybe they've been up and down the river all their lives, or have been hearing stories about what granduncle Raven found when he journeyed over the mountains to the east. At this point, you need to make a decision: do you expand the "at-start" fictional universe to include all those zones that the characters might reasonably be expected to be familiar with, so that any zones that are "revealed in play" (to the players) are also "discovered in-game" by the characters? Or is it the case that we as players may open up a new zone for us that in the fiction our characters already have some knowledge of?<br/><br/>Either option can be implemented in a bunch of ways. You can decide that there's a GM who determines the transformations for the entire map prior to play and reveals the ones that characters should know of to the players, or that the first session amounts to a world-burning session in which particular transformations are made in order to create the world of the characters, and that anything not defined is "terra incognita." You can begin play in the ruins of Heinz Field and make part of the process of play a determination about whether characters are visiting a known or previously unknown location.<br/><br/>Regardless of how you implement the "discovery" process, it's going to be the case that you've got assumptions about "the known" and "the unknown" such that, in the socio-political economy of the people, known locations as resources are going to be in a kind of homeostasis with respect to the people: "Here we gather berries in summer. Here we honor our dead. Here we initiate boys into manhood. Thus has it ever been." And as long as everyone cooperates, thus shall it ever be.<br/><br/>But when new locations are discovered and explored, the interesting question that emerges is how they will be integrated into the "life-world" of the tribe, and to what extent that integration throws off the sociocultural homeostasis of the people. "Since the young men discovered the new berry patches on the far side of the mountain, only the old women now remain to tend the gardens of Highness Field." <br/><br/>And an interesting way to implement that is through the prisoners' dilemma mechanic you had been using, except where "open" (cooperate) and "closed" (defect) now mean "stick to tradition" and "take advantage of the resources in the new zone," respectively. If everyone opens, things remain essentially how they were, despite the presence of the new. If only one person closes, he or she gains a resource advantage of some sort but also social enmity. If everyone (or even only most) people close, dramatic changes in the culture and society of the tribe occur -- that is, must be implemented in play.<br/><br/>The "tragedy of the commons" occurs when too many folks take advantage of a common or shared resource. So another implication of a lot of closure (defection, tradition-breaking) is to reduce the amount of potential resources available in the future, regardless of how much wealth has been generated. So it's ultimately not sustainable without further exploration and exploitation -- unless everyone refrains from breaking tradition in the first place.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it may be the case that <i>The Fifth World</i> won't be about quote-unquote "exploration" at all; rather, it'll be about <i>experiencing</i> the sort of post-urban society you're imagining. So what players are doing is gradually <i>articulating</i> a post-urban society, and that's what needs to be built into the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Thanks, Joshua. The larger point remains. In the world of the fiction, the "discovery" of new things means that there's a (new) common resource that can be taken advantage of equitably or inequitably, and some kind of dynamic imbalance occurs unless everyone takes advantage of it equitably (and possibly even then, as a scarce resource is depleted, but that's not the tragedy of the commons, as Joshua points out). Minimally, if the rest of you suckers want to keep raising sheep, you've got to find more land, because I'm using this piece here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It's funny that Joshua used sheep-herding in his example; that reminded me of the scene in <i>Red Mars</i> where John Boone tells his ultra-religious shipmate Phyllis that sheep-herding societies tended to produce patriarchal, monotheistic belief systems; later in the book, there's a lot of discussion of "eco-economics" and "gift economies" as alternatives to the corporate capitalism of Earth. So imagine that instead of the tragedy of the commons (where you are advantaged for taking more than your fair share of a common resource), you had a farce of the commons (where taking more than your fair share obligated you in some way to those around you): a "gift economy" predicated on a notion of communal obligations rather than individual property rights. In play, this means that when I go out on my vision quest, other players will be motivated to have their characters help me: give me things they've made, or found, or learned. But accepting their help obligates me, so now everything I possess is a burden of sorts that gives others the right to call on me for help, or hospitality, or shelter, and so forth.<br/><br/>Which maybe I want to have happen, since that lets me step on up and potlach my way to high social status in the tribe.
