That is, take what you're interested in and rub the serial numbers off. Here's my thinking process:<br/><br/>* With any licensed property, you're going to run into the frustrating and inevitable problem of differing levels of knowledge of and investment in canon. You can say "fuck canon, we're going to drop whatever we want to," but obviously you're going to keep some of it, otherwise you're not playing the game, right?<br/><br/>* So, what canon do you keep? I suspect many people would happily drop midiclorians as a symbiotic conduit to Jedi powers in a Star Wars game. But what if that's central to someone's understanding of the series? What if they're really moved by the issues of symbiosis and duality that it brings up?<br/><br/>* So, create a Sorny-fied (c.f. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenes_from_the_Class_Struggle_in_Springfield" rel="nofollow">Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield</a>) version of the game. All canon issues are then rendered additive, rather than subtractive. If it's there, it matters. If it's not, it doesn't. Luke et al. didn't want homo-hating to be a big part of their version of Dune, so it's not in Burning Sands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216389/#Comment_216389" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T11:57:46+00:00" title="July  4, 2009 11:57AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>So all those games that are just setting description + equipment list + some D20 or whatever leave me pretty cold.</blockquote>\nI agree with this. To take a licence and just staple on whatever hack system you have without really considering what makes the core product tick is really frustrating. It's why the <i>Serenity</i> RPG (as an example) is kinda terrible: it's just a generic engine with a paintjob of that setting. It's really important (I think) when developing a licenced product to ask yourself "what is it about this core product that keeps people coming back, and how can I replicate that experience at the game table?" TV shows about paranoia and tension should have paranoia and tension in their mechanics; similarly comedy, action, chases.<br/><br/>Imagine a <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i> licenced game that was just OGL with detailed car stats. How disappointing would that be? Instead, imagine a DoH game that took the concepts of comedy, car chases, and down-homeyness, and developed those into full-fledged mechanics.

I'm not all that keen on that, actually.<br/><br/>TSR's Marvel Supers had both approaches, one in the rule books and another in the modules, as did the DC Heroes game. The TSR Indiana Jones was almost all "The Lost Advetures of" approach (not counting the two movie modules), but handled it kind of badly.<br/><br/>I'd actually love to see some kind of dirty-hippy approach to this aspect of a licensed property game, even if it was as simple as making the game in a way thaat the GM position switched between sessions/adventures/episodes and all players had input into the next adventure ( possibly with characters switching around too, so everyone gets to interpret their version of a known character).<br/><br/>Hmm. I wonder how to work that?<br/><br/>Off-hand, maybe at the end of a session (or between sessions), everyone fills out a sheet that covers the basic gist of their wants for the next episode/issue/adventure, a list of characters in order of expected spotlighting (including any new characters just for that episode), and a few elements they'd like to see. A standardized form might help here.<br/><br/>If you are all actually at the table, the sheets get turned facedown and shuffled, then all players draw one. Each player in turn then reads off, aloud, the episode description, and players vote on which one they want to go with.<br/><br/>At that point, the creator of the voted in-episode reveals they are the creator. They'll be the GM for that episode, and they then get to choose the player-to-character match ups at any point up to the beginning of the following game.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/>In regards to licensed property games, some kind of commitment to emulation of the source material should probably be step one of a design process, and that means looking at what actually happens in the source material commonly. It's fairly important, IMO, to step back and look at that broadly first. LP designs seem to have plunged directly into mechanics ( especially of the old skool physics engine sort in many cases) before there has been any examination of the overriding commonalities of the source material.<br/><br/>One thing I've seen suggested is Levi K's ideas about players playing different roles in the game. I'm not talking so much about playing different characters, as different player-level functions ( although sometimes character protrayal comes into it, too). Building on some of the stuff that Levi has talked about, it might even be worthwhile to talk about different mechanics for players playing non-central characters, with mechanics being much more different the further a given character is from the focus of the play.<br/><br/>For example, many book series or film series I'm familiar with have a central character, around which everything reviolves. Going one layer out, we have companion characters. Often, these companions are better-skilled at something very specific than the main character, but tend to cause trouble for the sppotlight character in some fashion.Having an occasional spotlight scene is important from a source-material perspective, but that isn't the core of the source material fun.<br/><br/>For example, the main role ( stereotypically) of John Watson in Sherlock Holmes stories is to be wrong with his theories. Most of what Watson suggests is either incomplete or a bad interpretation. Once in a while, JW really shines, and aids greatly in events.<br/><br/>So what does Watson really do, once you step back? He tells you what most certainly did not happen, no matter how sensible it sounds.<br/><br/>In other single character focused stuff, the secondary character ( or sometimes two characters) provide really clear support roles, but at the cost of a heavy personal weakness. Supporting characters in IJ stories are like this. They can do something better than the main character, and occasionally have spotlight-time where they really show it off. Mostly, though, they have some personal weakness or role weakness that causes the main spotlight character trouble.<br/><br/>And that's their job, their role, when they aren't in the spotlight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish" title="MJ Harnish"><img alt="MJ Harnish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJ%20Harnish">MJ Harnish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216457/#Comment_216457" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T23:44:54+00:00" title="July  4, 2009 11:44PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Mouse Guard pulled off both the feel of the comics and is a good RPG as well. Most other licensed games I've tried fail miserably on one or both fronts. In most cases it's because the producer ends up simply playing a game in which you "adventure" in that setting. For example, BSG could have been a really  awesome RPG but instead simply turned into a generic adventure game. <img alt=":o" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/open_mouth.png" title=":o"/>(  <br/><br/>The biggest obstacle I see for most licensed material, which others have mentioned, is that hardcore fans of the program/book/comic/etc., as well as the holders of the copyright, are going to want the game to stay very true to the canon which can really constrict the RPG writer's creativity. In addition, licensed products often involve input from the original writers and/or their crack team of legal experts, which can be a nightmare. From what I've read of <i>The Song of Ice &amp; Fire</i>'s development, Martin held up the production of the game significantly simply because he was too busy to provide approval for the final draft. <br/><br/>That's a headache I wouldn't want.

Aside from the obvious ones, like getting access to art assets, a canon library to build/steal setting material from, and a built-in fan base who <i>will</i> buy your game because it's "official".<br/><br/>There are two benefits to play that I can see immediately. These are also considerations when deciding to run/play a licensed game.\n<ul>\n<li>It gets people who know the franchise well on the same page.</li>\n<li>It gets people who like the franchise a lot excited to play.</li>\n</ul>\nNone of these considerations give a hoot about "system" in the sense of mechanics. Instead, the franchise simply becomes a convenient short-hand description of play. What you, the designer, have to ensure is that your game (setting and mechanics) doesn't divert from the expectations implicit in this short-hand. For example, the gorgeous coffee-table-worthy Guardians of Order book "A Game of Thrones", the first attempt at making an official <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> RPG, failed miserably in this regard: while the fiction is mostly about intrigue and character drama, the game presented little more than a d20-based setting book, some special rules for emulating ASoIaF-style combat, and a pile of Prestige classes for you to go Adventure with. What one might expect to be the default play mode (especially given the title of the book), the intrigue-centric play surrounding titles, power and status, was relegated to a short paragraph in the back of the book summed up as "you can play it this way - no really, we promise".<br/><br/>I personally find the d20 system to be very poor at emulating any kind of source fiction, other than possibly fiction based on D&amp;D. The rules are focused around a highly tactical combat system and associated advancement, so any fiction which does not similarly centre around the protagonists slaying swaths of baddies and propelling into godhood will be unsuitable to play using d20. On the other hand, systems like GURPS and Unisystem, with its extensive list of skills which can be streamlined to suit your fiction and a simple default resolution system, present few assumptions about play. While none of these systems get me hot and bothered, I have successfully played a variety of source fiction using them, ranging from high fantasy to gritty sci-fi to modern horror and crime fiction.<br/><br/>There's an oddity in RPGs based on well-known franchises. If a franchise is a short-hand for coming to a shared understanding of how things should work in the game, why do we need tables upon tables of detailed equipment lists and stats for all the entities found in the fiction? Such tables are there to serve a similar purpose to the notion of franchise and genre - so that when the stormtroopers pull out their blaster rifles, I understand that I can probably duck behind a wall, take the occasional potshot, and still be safe, but when they bring out the thermal detonators I should probably look around for a nearby garbage chute to jump into. If everyone is already agreed on these facts, why this emphasis on lists upon lists of stats?<br/><br/>If you don't need a metric ton of source books full of equipment lists, extensive fluff text and official timelines, and a huge amount of art assets to get everyone on the same page with regards to what the game is about and how it should work, what is left for you to do? Mechanics, right... and the games which have been mentioned in a positive light so far are essentially just mechanics. Luke Crane has an uncanny way of adapting the Burning rules to successfully suit most every game he touches - not that there's much similarity between the system used in Burning Empires and Mouse Guard. I'm currently reading Anna Kreider's alpha of Black Sky (which is Firefly inspired), and I'm getting the same vibe - there is no fluff to remind me this is Firefly, but the actual game is more Firefly than the Serenity RPG ever was.<br/><br/>So to my mind, if you're going to write a game for a particular franchise, cut out all the franchise-specific fictional gunk and allow such elements to enter the game strictly through the group's shared understanding of the fiction. Tailor the mechanics to the source fiction, to ensure what the players end up doing at the table conforms to the things we expect the protagonists to do. And understand that if you do not do this, the players have exactly no impetus to buy your game over the GURPS quick-start rules.<br/><br/>I'd be interested to hear what people think of beloved franchise titles such as Star Wars: SAGA, Ghostbusters, Marvel Superheroes and others. Does the above ring true, or is there a compelling reason to include fiction-entity specific stats in these games other than upping page count and catering to drooling fanboism?<br/><br/>I too would love to see a Fallout RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216473/#Comment_216473" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T05:38:06+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  5:38AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I too would love to see a Fallout RPG.</blockquote>\nThere is one, it was made after the release of Fallout 2, but it's quite rare these days and difficult to get hold of.

Any advertising your project gets will come out of your own pocket.<br/><br/>Artwork is definitely one of the benefits of licensing a <i>comic</i>. Even then, you'll be surprised how many pieces won't be usable (especially if the comic predates the digital revolution). Many times, a comics frame works beautifully on the comics page, but doesn't work at all when isolated out of context. You'll find frames you think are perfect, and then you'll pull them out and see that they're cropped weirdly when on their own, or something similar. You will need additional artwork. You'll have to get the artist's sketches to fill out the book, or you'll have to ask the artist to produce more pieces, and that'll cost. Or, if your license allows it, maybe you'll hire additional artists.<br/><br/>Also, you better make sure that your layout is top-notch in order to put that art in its best light. If your layout skills aren't up to snuff, you'll need to hire someone to do it.<br/><br/>And don't forget to lawyer up. You'll need a contract that protects your interests. The licensor's version of the contract will make sure to protect the licensor, but probably won't pay much attention to your interests. You'll want your lawyer to go over it with a fine-toothed comb.<br/><br/>Make sure you can find at least one thing to love in the source material. You're going to suffer far too many headaches to make it worthwhile to work on something that doesn't contain something you're passionate about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

That is why the Serenity RPG was relatively successful despite the licensor fucking with it constantly - because everyone who watched Firefly took something different away from it. (I sometimes feel like I'm the only one who actually noticed that it's a fucking Western, despite the horses and cowboy hats.)  This is also why D20 adaptations worked well, because the D20 system was something people knew and could use in many many different ways to get where they wanted to go. Same with GURPS and Unisystem.  <br/><br/>TL;DR: If you are licensing something that has broad appeal for many different reasons, genericness is a feature and not a bug.<br/><br/>If by contrast you've licensed a laser-focused property that can really only be interpreted or approached in one way, then a specific system will help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216518/#Comment_216518" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-05T13:26:48+00:00" title="July  5, 2009  1:26PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>You can't imagine how disappointed I was with The Authority rpg.

Not an ultra-focused system, but the designer used Cinematic Unisystem and some custom Qualities and rules to capture the feel of the show quite effectively.  There were a few rules-specific hitches, like the way magic works and the truly astounding damage potential for a Slayer with high stats and a big-ass weapon, but overall it works great, giving plenty for both combat and support-type characters to do (with both OOC and IC demarcation of the character types).  I've never met C J Carella, but he seems to have really understood the source material and put a lot of love into adapting it.  Also, the license holder gave them some extra leeway, so that the Buffy books include a bunch of non-canonical material as well as the stuff we see in the show.  <br/><br/>The downside of licensed products is also seen in Eden's experience with the Buffy RPG -- from what I've read online, they had quite a bit of Buffy/Angel material ready to publish but were stymied by the license holder first delaying approval, and then pulling the license entirely.  (I probably got some of this wrong, so please correct me if you know more of the story.)  I don't know why they didn't take the proposed Watcher sourcebook, rewrite it as a guide to generic tea-drinking tweed-wearing occultists, and publish it anyway, but presumably there are legal issues involved.

Sometimes the spirit is actually more important than the canon and the fans know that.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Franchises normally suck. They tend to be, "give the characters stats," instead of helping to facilitate the creation of authentic stories in that universe.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>As MJ says, the Burning Crew know their business. The fact that I've had fun with their systems despite their totally being Not My Thing is a good indicator of that in general, and I understand that the Mouse Guard system is both Mouse Guard and Burning Wheel.</p>\n<p><a href="http://sanguinenews.livejournal.com/5949.html#cutid1" rel="nofollow">Albedo Platinum Catalyst</a> is a pretty decent job, even if it's got a bunch of baggage. It's a gritty, war story SF RPG about a gritty, war story comic. You name your hit points and give them jobs in your unit. You can see where that leads.</p>\n<p>What's neat about that is that it doesn't matter if Erma Felna, the protagonist in the comic, is there. She might make a cameo because it would be interesting or funny or poignant or whatever, but her presence, and the events of her story are not necessary to play an Albedo-style story.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
