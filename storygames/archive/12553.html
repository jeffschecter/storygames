However, I only have good numbers for last three quarters; before that, I just tracked lifetime sales.<br/><br/>Rest of this post is my anecdotal experience, sometimes foggy (if not properly backed with numbers) memory, and blantant wild-ass guesses from 12 years in the game industry as freelancer and nanopress publisher.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>Do these sales numbers represent the whole of your hobby-related income? Or are you doing other contract work?</blockquote>\nThey are the whole of my self-published income. I do freelance writing and editing work in the game industry (for example, Dresden Files, Unknown Armies).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>Do you have a day job? What percentage of your income comes from sales of your games? What percentage from contract work? What percentage from the day job? How have these percentages changed over time?</blockquote>\nDay-job: yes. On average, game sales are approximately 2% of my income [1], freelance work between 1% and 4% [2].<br/><br/>[1] Can go higher, in a year with a new release. <br/>2005 (T&amp;J) and 2009 (S7S) were possibly 5%.<br/><br/>[2] Can go higher or lower, depending upon number of gigs I get, size of gig, rate I agree to, etc. <br/>2009 (DFRPG) could have been 7%.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>The typical sales curve for a game is an early spike, and then a tapering off. Are any of your games defeating that pattern? Are any of them on a rising curve? If so, what do you think accounts for that?</blockquote>\nNo, but the rate of decline of the taper is not as sharp for two of my products: T&amp;J and ZoZ. The slope is flatter, at a higher sales level. There are occasional downticks (for unknown reasons) and upticks in that slope/tail, this latter usually related to reviews, awards, and new releases. [3]<br/><br/>[3] Size of uptick related to widespreadness/word-of-mouth of source.<br/><br/>Reviews uptick sales of a product [4]. Back catalog  sales effects minimal.<br/>Awards nominations uptick sales of a product [5]. Back catalog sales effects minimal.<br/>Awards uptick sales of a product [6]. Back catalog sales effects very small.<br/>New release gains a small uptick in sales of a product in back catalog [7].<br/><br/>[4] Review effect greatest in 1st qtr/inital 90 days of release; maybe one or two dozen copies over qtr. Afterward, 5 to 10. Increase this when there are several new reviews out at the same time.<br/><br/>[5] Nomination effect seems good for additional 5 to 10 copies that quarter. May add to flattening that product's long tail slope.<br/><br/>[6] Awards effect seems good for additional 10 to 20 copies that quarter. Pretty sure this adds to flattening the long tail. Also, 3 to 5 additional sales in back catalog that qtr seems to be usual, sometimes products that have sold a single copy in months.<br/><br/>[7] New release effect seems good for additional 5 to 15 back catalog sales that quarter. Unlikely to add to flattening the long tail of those products UNLESS those products already have reviews (several), nominations, and awards. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>And thanks for posting them.</blockquote>\nMy pleasure.

They do have excellent online publisher tools, tho, like sales-tracked and special offers and version updates and whatnot.</blockquote>\n30% and 35%. There used to be a $40 sign-up fee. They'll pretty much take anyone, but there are loose standards for products and covers - if someone puts up something a bit naff it might get spotted and they'd be asked to improve or remove it. I'm thinking of things like a cover that might have been drawn by a child with a dodgy crayon (it occasionally happens).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
