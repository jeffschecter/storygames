I'm still working on assembling footage, but these are approximately the first half of the game:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS-MmxpjbSQ" rel="nofollow">A Flower for Mara Opening</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id_SL9JbaOE" rel="nofollow">A Flower for Mara Funeral Dinner Part 1</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFEjb0DwgHA" rel="nofollow">A Flower for Mara Funeral Dinner Part 2</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV3xumnQaPo" rel="nofollow">A Flower for Mara Spring Scenes part 1</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5bVs3WccBc" rel="nofollow">A Flower for Mara Spring Scenes part 2</a>:  this clip illustrates the use of "phone call" techniques to have two characters talking to each other on the phone.  In our game, we ended up turning this conversation into two spotlight scenes, one for each side of the conversation.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCFdOIhiqhI" rel="nofollow">A Flower for Mara Spring Scenes part 3</a>:  This clip illustrates the use of off-stage characters.  Also shows the general mood of the evening, which was happy and not at all bleak.  This is an important point, actually.  <i>We enjoyed playing the game.</i>  Sure, a lot of it was catharsis, but we enjoyed doing this thing together.  Finally, you can see the feedback from the "audience" to the developing storyline.  Cast members are perfectly free to make comments during the game, and there was a lot of talking in between scenes.  This is a Good Thing; it showed me that everyone was engaged in what was going on.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFQWB1NMWSA" rel="nofollow">A Flower for Mara Spring Scenes part 4</a>:  The exchange beginning around 2:10 shows an excellent example of Endowment in play by Whitney (portraying Ruth).  (Endowment is giving another character or object an attribute of some kind.)  It was fairly subtle, too.  It took me a little bit to realize that, according to Whitney's statement, Mara had stolen Ruth's boyfriend and then married him.  This wasn't part of anything preplanned, and it is an excellent example of what makes this game work.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PUFkVTd8ao" rel="nofollow">A Flower for Mara Easter Dinner Part 1</a>:  I was particularly pleased with a shocking explosion from Jana (starting around 8:00), set up by Jennifer as a result of the preceding soliloquy.  This is a good example of how one player can use soliloquy information to help set up another player's actions.  In addition, Jennifer's statement that that pizza was for dinner was another excellent use of Endowment.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BFGNg0UwBk" rel="nofollow">A Flower for Mara Easter Dinner Part 2</a><br/><br/>Watching these has been pretty neat, since it reminds me of playing the game that night.  Ever have a game that was especially meaningful to you?  This was one of those games.  Thanks again to everyone who was a part of it.<br/><br/>Anyways!  Hopefully seeing this footage gives you an idea of how <i>A Flower for Mara</i> will play.  I need to playtest a couple more times (and some external playtesting would be <i>great</i>), but I think that I will soon be ready to write this sucker.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127475/#Comment_127475" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T04:42:13+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  4:42AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa.

What were the logistics of filming?</blockquote>\nWe had the camera set up in the corner, with Crystal doing the camera work.  I told her that the goal was to document.  She did this quite well, I thought.  With the exception of a couple of minor hiccups, I didn't have to think about it at all.\n<blockquote>2.  How did it impact the experience of play?</blockquote>\nMinimal at best.  As I said, the camera was in the corner, as opposed to a cameraman prowling around, shoving the camera in people's faces.  I also told the cast that this was primarily for my playtesting purposes and that, if I released footage to the public, it would not include any of the flower monologues (in other words, their personal stories).  They all understood why I'd want to document things, and I don't think that they gave the camera much thought.\n<blockquote>3.  What are you, as a designer, going to glean from this?  What's your plan?  How will you use the footage?</blockquote>\nFirst, I figured that I'd use it just like any other AP recording that I'd receive from a playtest group:  see what worked well in play, what didn't, where there was confusion, etc.  Second, I figure that I'll use it...like I am right now, to give some insight into what this game looks like in play.  I mean, it's not a hard game, but it is conceptually foreign to most gamers in the U.S., I'll guess.  Finally, I may use clips to illustrate specific techniques, similar to what I did in the original post.<br/><br/>In other words, I'd like to figure out ways of helping the final users of <i>A Flower for Mara</i> understand and enjoy the game, using this footage as illustration.  Still not sure exactly how I'll do it, but that's what I'm thinking about.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127509/#Comment_127509" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T06:11:59+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  6:11AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks.

Where did the idea for the game come from?</blockquote>\nYeah, I've been calling it "Jeepform-ish", because it has definitely been inspired by my looking into Nordic LARP and Jeepform in particular.  However, I've made no specific attempt to follow the Jeepform truths, nor have I actually played any Jeepform.  So, take all that for what you will.<br/><br/>Here's the basic situation.  Mara is a woman who has suddenly died under some sort of tragic circumstances.  Think "car accident" or "sudden heart attack" or even "murdered".  (This is decided by the group.)  The cast plays through the first year after her death.  All the characters are direct relatives of Mara:  her husband, her daughter, her father, her mother, her brother, and her sister.<br/><br/>Play goes through four acts, based on the four seasons.  In each Act, each player who still has a flower gets a spotlight scene focused on his character.  After each scene is finished, the group sits down for a holiday scene, centered around a meal.  While they play through this, they also give soliloquies to inform the "audience" of their actual emotional state.<br/><br/>At the beginning of play, each participant is given a flower and a piece of paper.  You write a "grief" on the piece of paper and attach it to the flower.  This grief is something that has actually happened in your life that has brought you sorrow.  That flower then represents the overwhelming grief of your character.  Putting down the flower is a symbolic gesture, indicating that the character has taken the first step towards moving past his grief over Mara.  In order to put down the flower, the player tells a little bit about his grief to the rest of the group.<br/><br/>Mara is a character in the game.  She's a metaphorical ghost, only appearing to a character whose scene or soliloquy it is.  She represents all the memories that the character has of Mara.<br/><br/>The idea was originally a ghost story that a friend of mine was working on.  Slowly the idea became more and more influenced by me, until we did an idea swap.  I got Mara, and he got an idea of mine.  Good trade.<br/><br/>Originally, he was going to do this as a screenplay.  Then, when I got custody of the idea, I decided that I wanted it to be a play.  Then, as I was reading about Nordic LARP stuff, I wanted the play to be all funky, breaking the fourth wall and drawing in the audience.  The flower thing was originally an audience participation idea.  Then, when I was reading about Jeepform, I realized that, while I might never get a play off the ground, I'm not really a playwright.  But I am a game designer....<br/><br/>The rest came fairly quickly, drawing on the prep work that we had done on the project up to that point.<br/><br/>For more information that you might care to know, I'm <a href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/category/games/roleplaying-games/flowers-for-mara-development-and-playtest/" rel="nofollow">tracking development</a> on <a href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com" rel="nofollow">my blog</a>.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127574/#Comment_127574" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T08:34:18+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  8:34AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, one more thing.
