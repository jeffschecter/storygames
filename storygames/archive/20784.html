I give them a couple of random words their characters overheard and each player comes up with a rumor. Then they choose one and start making questions about it. I impro most of the answers, if there isn't already something in my prep I can use.<br/>-I'm using a few hexcrawler guidelines so players spend part of the session travelling to the place of the quest. We often end the session when they have just arrived, which gives me time to prep the actual place.<br/><br/>So far I can impro places, NPCs and dungeons on the spot quite nicely, but monsters and encounters pose an entirely different problem. It isn't enough for me to pull a few monster cards with stats and calculate the encounter. I've got to come up with a story for the encounter: a reason these things are here and will threat the party in a way that makes them react (I'm not handling XP at all in this campaign) From that I infer what traces the party finds in their way to the encounter that could either pick their curiosity, give them a hint of how hard the encounter could be or even what kind of stuff they should prepare in advance.<br/><br/>Then I've got to design the encounter: play with the variables as visibility, terrain, hazards, obstacles, things that can be used against the monsters or things that could make the encounter worse, time constraints and monster equipment if applicable. Then comes treasure, I've got to include there something interesting but balanced. <br/><br/>And along all this process I've got to hit a few player flags. Maybe the treasure includes a weapon that gives the fighter an interesting new tactic, or it's a new spell for the cleric. Maybe there's something that brings up something in the rogue's background. Maybe the place of the encounter is important for the cleric. At least I made all the backstory from things that the players created themselves, either on the setting brainstorming session or on their character sheet, so I'm hitting flags left and right most of the time.<br/><br/>I'm leaving the encounter calculations and monster lists to a couple of online random encounter generators, and then prepping the rest myself. It's not as fast as I'd like but it yields good enough results. I started using Evernote to help me with this but it isn't as good as I expected, with the 60mb upload limit and the fact that on the table I'm using a tablet and not a laptop to visualize the files. However, the model to organize the info stuck with me and I'm trying using it on googledocs next session.<br/><br/>So, any tricks to handle encounter prep? Anything else you have found to be quite useful when doing prep?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456408/#Comment_456408" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-20T21:47:03+00:00" title="September 20, 2016  9:47PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WarriorMonk,<br/><br/>It sounds like you're giving yourself very little to work (many limitations), and then saddling yourself with incredibly steep expectations.<br/><br/>For instance, why is it necessary to make "something interesting but balanced"? Why is it necessary to hit player flags with treasure? Why do you have to have backstories for monsters in place? Etc.<br/><br/>Each of these is entirely optional. In fact, my favourite games of D&amp;D didn't involve any of those three things, leaving alone your other various requirements.<br/><br/>For example, many D&amp;D campaigns simply feature a fictional explanation for the existence of monsters. ("Twenty years ago, a magical cataclysm opened rifts around the world. Before they closed, thousands of monstrous and alien beings came through them. Now, those who remain wander the landscape or hide in abandoned caves. All are hungry and fierce.")<br/><br/>You could also move a lot of the onus for this stuff onto the players. Hitting flags with treasure? Have each player come up with a fun item for another character to find. ("Hey, Jim, send me an e-mail: what do you think Alice's character would love to find in a dungeon sometime?") Then, in secret, roll a die for each one, and on a bad roll modify it somehow - add a complication, a curse, or change its parameters. ("Yes, you find a magical item that allows you to teleport. However, it requires human sacrifice to operate/it's so big you would need some kind of vehicle or many, many beasts to move it.")<br/><br/>Sounds like fun to me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456410/#Comment_456410" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-20T22:05:16+00:00" title="September 20, 2016 10:05PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the party's purpose?

Actually I'm enjoying doing all this and I want to make something special for my players. Like, the draconic warlock with the sage background, who has a letter from a dead comrade posing a question... I went as far as writing a riddle with invisible ink on a piece of paper that needs to be folded and read through a mirror. It's going to be easier to find out than it sounds anyway, since a couple of players already saw my sketches by accident. But I'm having tons of fun anyway. What's so bad about trying to improve a bit, and then make things a bit easier on my side so I can focus on sharing that with the players?<br/><br/>But don't take it as if I'm actually trying to do too much. My encounter prep still ends up being five lines of text or so, a couple of images and monster stats copypasted from a digital monster manual. I'm just looking for even an easier way to do it. I do use some monster without story or improvise the encounter and it isn't too bad, but definitely I get better material when I give it some thought and players pay more attention whenever the story turn involves them directly. It's not like I'm hitting flags every scene, I'm okay doing it once per session, preferably one flag per PC but it isn't a must.<br/><br/>For items, since I'm a more visual-oriented thinker, I tried Pinterest for stuff and got <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/explore/espadas-936724516716/" rel="nofollow">images for weapons</a> and items that tell a whole story or pose an interesting puzzle by themselves (forgot to include this one on my list of tricks above)<br/><br/>Also, skimming through the monster manual or the list of spells is also enough to give you interesting ideas for items, places and enconuters. I'm still eager to try the animated object combo: An ornamented dungeon entrance that looks like a reception, complete with a standing ornamental full armor with a sword and a red carpet. You can animate any combination of those and even reuse the scene to keep players at edge.<br/><br/>And JD, surprisingly enough, the players seem to be acting like adventurers instead of murderhobos, for a change. I mean, they haven't stated their purpose yet but since their options feel unlimited they are totally going for the "we're adventurers" feeling.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456420/#Comment_456420" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-21T04:09:34+00:00" title="September 21, 2016  4:09AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So are they interested in money and fame?

They came up with a couple interesting features in their backgrounds that Im exploiting and since they made the world, whatever that targets their specie's culture is also game. <br/><br/>I've never prepped anything considering distances, though we use a grid that now I've covered with transparent film to draw on it with markers. I always improvise whatever location features are needed, and lay bottle caps to signal bushes, trees, columns or whatever that could count as cover. This alone often ends up making the location quite interesting in tactical terms, at no extra prep cost.<br/><br/>My prep for an encounter now looks like this:<br/><br/>-On the way: you see a tenuous red intermittent aura from far away, as you get close it looks like a mass of dancing red lights, accompanied by a low humming sound.<br/>-Four columns of dirt/mud stand surrounding the lights, amidst a few trees and bushes -it's a colony of giant fire beetles. <br/>-In the middle, old and half buried, lie the remains of a humanoid creature.<br/>-There seems to be someone sitting with their back against one of the columns, though you can't see much from where you are. <br/><br/>Then comes the giant beetle stats, a pic I found on the web and a similar amount of lines explaining things about the two corpses and their belongings, where the rest of the interesting stuff is. And that's it. The bushes and trees around the colony present the tactical opportunity, whict I'll randomly position when the encounter starts, so no further prep there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456687/#Comment_456687" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-28T13:42:06+00:00" title="September 28, 2016  1:42PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, note for anyone who would like to try the invisible ink trick: once the players come up with the idea to use fire, don't let them use an open flame on the paper, an iron is better.
