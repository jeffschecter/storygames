The thing is that those procedures weren't needed for the game to be fun, and the rest of the procedures used made up for the ones we didn't use. <br/><br/>I know most of this depends of what kind of atmosphere you're replicating, and lately games are kinda modular, so it's not like you have to use and know all the rules of a game to have fun. So my question is more on the lines of "In how many procedures an average player can concentrate while having fun?" (which is absolutely NOT the same as "in how many things you can concentrate for about two or three hours?")<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverwizard" title="Silverwizard"><img alt="Silverwizard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverwizard">Silverwizard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385983/#Comment_385983" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T13:57:56+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  1:57PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps a better question might be "how many procedures in a class" (or race, player, whatever).<br/><br/>A lot of games will have a lot of complexity, but have each player managing only a fraction of that complexity. In Dresden Files, you see only spellcasters dealing with all the magic difficulty, only people with certain powers using the alternate forms, or the Hunger Stress. Apocolypse World even has moves which are per player.<br/><br/>I definitely think that there are only so many different pieces in a toolbox before people decide to not dig deeper though, but I think complexity should be thought of on a per-player basis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385990/#Comment_385990" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T15:56:32+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  3:56PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps I'm using the wrong words, since not only english isn't my native language but what I thought was called "procedures" is probably something else. Perhaps If I use some examples from my own experience it could make the question clearer:<br/><br/>When we play Pathfinder, our group doesn't need or use the whole book of rules or keeps exact order in the use of all of them (I thought "procedures" was used for this last meaning). We make most of the character management part before or after the session and in the session we use 50% of the time doing almost free style roleplaying, 20% dealing with the resolution mechanic and some offtopic the rest of the time. Since the GM deals with the rest there are a lot of things we don't use:<br/>-Keeping track of the maps<br/>-Using weather rules<br/>-etc since I haven't readed thoroughly the core rulebook, so tell me what else I'm missing.<br/><br/>My point is that as a designer you can (and you probably have to) design a few steps ahead of what the players will make with the game, like rules for mass combat, players using monsters as PCs, rules about aging, followers and political intrigue, etc etc.<br/><br/>So I'm not wondering about which rules (well, I insist I remember this was called "procedures" since it wasn't only rules but rules+mechanics+social interacion, in and out of character events) again, I'm not wonderin about which rules are used for each type of game, but about the number of procedures you use in a game. It's really hard to tell since now we play by instinct and we're probably mixing procedures from other games into the games we're playing right now.<br/><br/>Would you say it's like... 5 procedures? 10?, 3?<br/><br/>Let me try to separate some procedures we normally use, as an example:<br/><br/>-The GM narrates/explains some background. Perhaps allows some input from the players.<br/>-Then the GM frames an scene with the players in it, in present time. It's no longer part of the previous stage, which probably bored the players to death, now everybody is really playing attention since they know what it means when the GM mentions they are somewhere doing something.<br/>-Everything comes to the point where the GM asks "What do you do?" and players state their character's actions. Again, this is another process, probably players are now checking their sheets to see what options are available to them if they are not inspired already. The GM will probably make some comments to distract them or point them to an specific place or route of action.<br/>-Conflict resolution! This is the part where players roll the dice and add their bonuses, and the GM compares the result to determine the outcome. This part is completely mechanic.<br/><br/>And as you see, though all processes are connected, your mind has gone from the story, to your own story, to the actions, and finally to the numbers. Each process had some enjoyment of it's own but yet each one was a completely different part of the game. The cycle then goes backward: the GM narrates the outcome of the dice roll, which prompts new actions, sending the story in a particular direction and eventually modifying the background. So, outside of character management, that's 4 procedures (probably more or less depending on how you play it, and some particular scenes may require other specific procedures) on the players side, add perhaps five more for the GM... that's 9 for your regular trad game. What about other games? How many do you think you use when you play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385994/#Comment_385994" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T17:27:50+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  5:27PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a fan of three.

So far the game I'm designing has:<br/><br/>-a short character and world creation procedure (I'm thinking of making it a bit more random or recycle another procedure to do this part)<br/>-a procedure to create a story for the players (on the next playtest I'll try making a single story to connect all PCs, since having each player make their own story and trying to connect them will create more unnecessary procedures)<br/>-a procedure to create random challenges (with one variant procedure to add social conflicts)<br/>-a conflict resolution mechanic<br/>-some character micromanagement<br/>-Another procedure to record and add twists to the story.<br/><br/>So that's six so far, though I'm still thinking of what I can do to recycle and make procedures more simple. Most of this processes are usually left to the GM to figure out from some simple guidelines, but here I can't have that luxury. The audience I'm selling it to doesn't have previous experience with tabletop rpgs, so the risk of players having an acute case of blank page syndrome through all the game is quite high.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386302/#Comment_386302" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-03T10:05:14+00:00" title="August  3, 2012 10:05AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Each of the procedures you've listed might easily develop into separate procedures as you work out the system.<br/><br/>BUT the rule about 7+/-2 procedures, isn't as hard and fast as 7 per game. It's per context. <br/><br/>You could easily have a game where there are, say, 7 procedures for setting up an adventure, 7 procedures for doing one type of conflict (and 7 more types of conflict to choose between), 7 procedures for handling advancement, and so on. You don't need to hold the entire game in your head at any single moment.<br/><br/>Procedures themselves will vary. Some will be elegant, intuitive, or flow naturally that they are easy to manage. Others will be clunky, confused, maybe with lots of detail that make them hard to use off-the-cuff. So a hard and fast rule of 6 or 7 procedures doesn't make sense to me. Dont start with an arbitrary number of procedures you need to make a game. Design what your game needs, and the number of procedures needed will arise naturally.<br/><br/>Also, individually people will vary massively on how much they are willing to tolerate, or how much crunchiness they actively enjoy (or hate). That is a different issue IMO to how much they can cognitively cope with. One person will like lots of detail in the combat system, another will prefer to handle it all with a single die roll. That second player might like lots of detail in the game's intrigue and social positioning system, which bores rigid the first player. But both can handle 7 procedures confidently if they need to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386307/#Comment_386307" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-03T10:49:02+00:00" title="August  3, 2012 10:49AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that no one player should ever have to deal with any more than 3, but different characters could have access to different procedures. <br/><br/>At least I hope....<br/>The game I have been play testing of and on for about the last year has several systems (physical conflict, unit conflicts, debate, social networking, social status, computer hacking, chase, and simple tests), but no one character ever has access to more than 2 per episode.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386309/#Comment_386309" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-03T11:06:04+00:00" title="August  3, 2012 11:06AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thadrine, Nom, for example that's one of the best things about AW and it's hacks: as a player you don't need to know each procedure, you can read and use it right from your character playbook; it's almost the same procedure for everything in the game and it makes things more interesting even when you fail.<br/><br/>So yes, you can have a ton of procedures but you would probably prefer to give those procedures only to the players that will use them, in a separate booklet for each player to have the procedures at hand, instead of listing them mixed in the corebook.<br/><br/>Yet, for the game I'm designing I'm specifically looking for the optimal minimum, so if I can make it in five, or have the players choose or design procedures of their own for specific cases, it would be perfect for my design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
