Meeting me sort of vicariously plugged him into the story/indie games community and he's looking to make indie games a big part of future cons. This left me with a mission to use my "contacts" in the community to see what needs to be done. Here I am! :-P<br/><br/>I'll give you guys the basic info about this particular con since I know it makes a bit of difference. My experience at NeonCon showed it to be a 4 day convention centered more around actual gaming than advertising new releases and the like. The owner has a ton of event experience and picked a good location and a good price of $45. The event was mostly RPGA stuff since that was the only thing the owner was familiar with a year ago. There were 300-400 people this year, but 90% of them were RPGAers. That number could easily be doubled with a few efforts to attract the other side of the gaming crowd.<br/><br/>I have a few ideas of my own, but I'd like to leave the floor open to whatever comes to mind from this particular gallery of peanuts.<br/><br/>1. What attracts you to a particular con?<br/>2. What turns you away from another con?<br/>3. What makes a con worth heading out of state for?<br/>4. What do you look for as a gamer?<br/>5. What do you look for as a designer or publisher?<br/><br/>That's the only questions I can think of right now. Feel free to add any pertinent ideas, advice or questions you have!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189125/#Comment_189125" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T04:51:38+00:00" title="January 20, 2009  4:51AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your dude should get in touch with Vinnie at Dreamation, who does these things extremely right.
