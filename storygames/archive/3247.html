As such, it will undoubtedly have some similarities to the base Heroquest system. But it will also be significantly different, reflecting our vision of the sort of game that we always hoped HQ would support (but which it didn't always provide, at least without some modification, and a lot of technique in play). Not a simple imitation of Heroquest, then, but a departure in a specific direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Worlds will be released as a core rulebook of around 100,000 words. Most of that material will be advice; advice on playing the game, advice on running the game, and advice on adapting the game to any genre or setting you see fit. We will also be including 'genre snapshots' for a wide variety of different genres - Fantasy, Science Fiction, Wild West, Pirates, Horror, Superheroes - to enable you to start playing more or less straight away. The game will be released with some sort of open license, and will be followed up almost immediately with a few more detailed books on how to play with the rules in specific genres, and even specific settings meant for play with the rules. Others will, of course, be able to create their own products based off the core rules as they wish as long as they abide by the details of the specific license.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen will Other Worlds be released? Given that we already have a very strong direction, we're hoping it won't take too long for us to take what we already have, and fashion the text to what we want it to be. We aren't making any promises, but it shouldn't take too long for us to get to an advanced state. That said, we're committed to thoroughly playtesting the game (both internally and independently), and it won't see the light of day until such time as that has happened - however long that takes. Our priority is to get this done right as opposed to getting it done quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, we'd like to say a big thank you to everyone who contacted us with messages of support and encouragement. While we are disappointed that we won't be able to continue working on the Questworlds project, we are looking forward to creating our own game for publication. We have spent the last few months re-examining our design goals and making sure that we have something new and interesting to bring to the table. The response from all those who have seen our playtest manuscript has been an unqualified 'yes'. From that perspective, we thank Moon Design Publishing for pushing us on to create the game that we really wanted to make. This is a real labor of love for us and we hope it shows.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe'd be pleased to answer any questions you have about the project in this space.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73800/#Comment_73800" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T11:20:01+00:00" title="June  5, 2007 11:20AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mike,<br><br>Congratulations on the new project.

In our writing of QW, we had really taken some of the HQ design in some very specific directions. So it was already probably "new" enough to count as it's own game at that point. Now that we're not constrained by the idea of the project having to be "Generic Hero Quest" we've taken it off even further. So it's definitely it's own game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, you'll recognize some of the structures and their functions in play, and some of the mechanics will be vaguely familiar from HQ play. But there'll be substantive differences, and it'll all fit together into the puzzle that we want it to be. Not just a generic version of an old set of rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a "for instance," I think we've settled on a single resolution system that covers every type of conflict you might want to have - no more multiple resolution systems to handle different situations (steals back a bit from TSOY, actually, but goes a step farther and steals from DitV, too). That might include ways to handle all of the mechanical variations that you tended to find in HQ (things like variable augmenting, heroforming, HQ Challenge rules, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nUnsurprisingly, perhaps, the resolution system will be firmly set as conflict resolution, with methods to support that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's also likely that the dice mechanics will be pretty different from HQ - we're toying with several working models there right now. The goal being to keep HQ's strenghts in such things as scale, but allowing for faster and more nuanced results (to say nothing of them having to fit our various other changes).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way that the character is structured will be a little different than the HQ keyword/ability model, in that the relationships between these things will be clearly defined and unambiguous. All while allowing you to create structures you feel you need to support whatever genre in which you find yourself playing. Allowing you to nail characters down to the genre with ease and power.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe currency becomes clearly metagame, no longer tied down to any notions of learning effort or such. Character ability development will be very dynamic - capable of fine grained tuning, but allowing for more radical changes in the character.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that give an idea?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll have a playtest version of this with me at GenCon (one way or another), so if anyone wants to try it out there, let me know! We'll also probably be looking for independent playtesters pretty soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the Interest, gents!<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74046/#Comment_74046" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T13:44:02+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  1:44PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gives a great idea, Mike.

In HQ, there is a serious question as to what keywords are, precisely. Are they simply packages of abilities that a player gets to start play? Are they broad abilities? Do they provide abilities at their rating? By what criteria? <br>\n<br>\nWhat we do is to say that a template (the term we're using nowadays) is very specifically a set of abilities that some set of people in the setting could be said to have... even if that set of people might currently be limited to one. <br>\n<br>\nThat sounds contradictory, on the surface, but consider: let's say that I have a "Trademark" (a special template that is player defined, as opposed to being categorized as, say, an occupation) that represents my character having a unique ray-gun. Nobody else in the words has the powers of that template. Until, of course, they pick up the ray-gun. <br>\n<br>\nFor another example, say you have a character who has learned a very specific assassin's way, and learned it from the world's only living practitioner - who then dies. Leaving the character the sole owner of this template. Well, it's still a template, because, if taught to somebody else, it's still the same set of abilities. <br>\n<br>\nAs soon as the player says, that an ability he wants to add was learned as a side-effect of the template... now that has to go into the character's "Other abilities" (we've been considering that a special template of it's own for a while now, since that's mechanically sound). <br>\n<br>\nGot to run now. But later I'll explain how abilities get into templates - both at chargen, and later. <br>\n<br>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Newt" title="Newt"><img alt="Newt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/923/nGMWSF8SCT3UB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Newt">Newt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93616/#Comment_93616" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T23:02:02+00:00" title="September  6, 2007 11:02PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Best or luck with this one Mike <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nYou and the rest of the Otherworlds team deserve bucket loads of success <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Flynn" title="Flynn"><img alt="Flynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Flynn">Flynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118512/#Comment_118512" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-08T10:42:12+00:00" title="January  8, 2008 10:42AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, Mark, and Scott -<br><br>Any update on the status of Other Worlds?

Other Worlds and HeroQuest are entirely separate games. Still, it's fair to say that it won't be too difficult to translate characters from one system to the other, because they are both based on similar principles (i.e. characters as long lists of descriptors).<br/>\n<br/>\nDroog: If you've already drifted HQ in a narrativist direction then you will find the Other Worlds system gives you a lot more mechanical support for that playstyle. You will also find a huge stack of advice and suggestions about how to make it more fun and about how to adapt the system to different genres (including several quick-start genre conversion packages). <br/>\n<br/>\nNeither myself or Mike can speak for the revised HeroQuest because we have nothing to do with it whatsoever. <br/>\n<br/>\nMark Humphreys                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135182/#Comment_135182" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T07:38:48+00:00" title="March 17, 2008  7:38AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me put it this way... I've played with HQ for years now, and I love it. But I'm switching to OW for my own play. Because the way we've designed it, I can play it without any modifications. I do modify HQ somewhat when I play, because some of the rules simply militate against the style of play that I prefer. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you read my second post above, you may get some idea as to how we've done this. But to give another example, a subtle change that we've made (and one that will surprise nobody), is that we've done away with "bonuses" for equipment that are not situationally based. So there's no more incentive to "game" the game by getting the biggest sword, and heaviest armor, etc. There's still incentive, but it's more organically in-game, in that the bonuses are local to the contest at hand. Or penalties. So if you're swimming in heavy armor, the modifier is going to be appropriate for the contest at hand. Just as it will be when your armor outclasses another combatants. So your character will want such stuff if he would want it.. is he going to be a swimmer, or a warrior? Or even, we use this sort of sword, because it's what our culture can produce, and we think that it's best. It's only when you say that the scimitar is objectively better mechanically than the longsword that players have their knights weild scimitars...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm hoping that the combination of rules that Mark and I have come up with will appeal to players like he and I who have minor gripes about how HQ runs as written. Some of it is simply clarification. In HQ, if you cast a spell to leap over a tree, does the tree resist with "Tall?" Or does the player get to use the default 16? The HQ text simply doesn't give you a direct answer, or even a principle from which to judge. We give clear rules, or clear indications on what method of judgment is indicated for a particular decision. So that the whole thing meshes together well. Hopefully, the way we've written it, the question "How do a melee combatant, and a ranged weapon user interact?" will have an obvious answer. <br/>\n<br/>\nWill Other Worlds do anything that I can't currently do with HQ? Nope, not really. Will it do some things better and more easily? Yes, definitely. It's a better tool for the same job. If Mark and I have done what I hope we've done. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlaytesting will tell. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/grey.spiral" title="grey.spiral"><img alt="grey.spiral" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i148.photobucket.com/albums/s2/greySpiral/boogiepop012hushie1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/grey.spiral">grey.spiral</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135302/#Comment_135302" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T22:04:00+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 10:04PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everytime I read the Heroquest book I feel like the game is somehow lying to me about how it works.

Actually if I can get somebody to make a good HTML version, I'd like to distribute it that way as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe playtest rules are using percentile dice... though I've also done some preliminary testing with pools of D20s, and other systems as well. Can't say for sure what the final form will use until we've got playtest info back. Note that we don't adhere to any die conventions out of comfort, or novelty, but seek to find the one that works best for what we're trying to accomplish with the system overall. Including things like speed and ease of use, but also all the other myriad goals that the system has. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137813/#Comment_137813" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T07:12:21+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  7:12AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>It's OoP, so I guess the answer is "no where" or "various places" depending on if you want a new or used copy, or get lucky.</blockquote>\nUmm, as far as I know, you can still get <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php?products_id=12424&amp;it=1&amp;filters=0_0_0&amp;manufacturers_id=79" rel="nofollow">a PDF of the HeroQuest rules from DriveThruRPG</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137964/#Comment_137964" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-03T14:28:12+00:00" title="April  3, 2008  2:28PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, FWIW, the stillborn Exile game from WW had an interesting percentile mechanic wherein the tens digit equalled "successes" and the units digit just helped you hit your target number, which fell somewhere between 1 and 100, obviously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138214/#Comment_138214" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-04T14:04:35+00:00" title="April  4, 2008  2:04PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm....

I do this for one because I really like it, and what is produced. I also do it, however, because it means that I don't have to carry around a scenario, and can play the game at the drop of a hat. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I don't want to give people the idea that this is the default way to play Other Worlds. We don't really present a default in the text, allowing people to play with whatever level of pre-creation that they're comfortable with. The option to play starting with nothing is just that, an option. Even if you do start with nothing, you can do a lot of character generation prior to starting the first scene, and not be thrown in the deep water immediately as I do most times in play at the cons. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, the game to which Clyde refers was a short one in which several species of "fish-men" (for lack of a better term to group them) were at war with each other. My old co-conspirator Ralph Mazza created a race of "shark-men" that were completely subject to the whims of their appetites, who had apparently eaten the queen and children of the king of another race. Tony (I forget his last name), created and ran that side, as a spy for their people about to make a retributive attack agains the shark people. He watched as Ralph's character, a War Oracle named someting like Bloodmonger Jawrek Tok, made predicitons about the battle, and dictated a battle plan to another PC. That PC belonged to a race of spikey fish-men who served as warriors for the shark-men, who formed an upper-class priesthood for the overall culture who, it turns out, was ruled by a killer whale (apparently a regular one, not any more intelligent than those in the real world). Another PC was a spymaster for the War Oracle. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs the battle erupts, I had a huge volcano beast erupt from under the sands, and start boiling the members of both sides. An emmissary from each side tried to parley with the PCs, to see if they would break off the engagement, perhaps to join up to deal with the new threat. To no avail, both sides decide to stay at each other's throats. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd after the PCs personally struggling to kill each other, both cultures are pretty much devastated, everyone dead...<br/>\n<br/>\nAren't you glad we're mammals? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Tweaker" title="The Tweaker"><img alt="The Tweaker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Tweaker">The Tweaker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139586/#Comment_139586" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T08:49:05+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  8:49AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must say that I am very impressed by your summary, Mike.

Especially the part about him being so loyal to the sharks that he couldn't possibly think about saving his own skin. You see, he was both physically and metaphorically spineless...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Matt!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlfredo, how do we create settings on the fly? By creating characters, and requiring that character creation to include the character's culture, occupation, species, etc. The players made it all up, 100%. Hell, as I noted to somebody after play, all I added to play was an altar, and the big lava monster. <br/>\n<br/>\nI find now when I play other games, especially fantasy games, that the dissociation of characters from their culture is just bizzarre. Oh, we might be seeing elements of their culture in their acts, but we rarely ever know. In Other Worlds it's always quite clear whether or not something the character is doing is characteristic for his culture or just something that he's on about himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes this is mechanically critical in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several potential mechanisms one can use to control things other than one's character. I was using an admittedly kludgey one, and should have use one of the tighter ones I realized after the fact. That is, it would have been best to make the battle a conflict between Tony's character and Ralph's character, and treated the armies as "equipment" (basically a situational modifier). But the rules include more than one way to skin that cat. Including, for instance, taking an army or a culture or something as a "trademark" for that character. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, the players didn't have direct control of the armies. Their characters had indirect control, however, and so we represented this as a fight between the armies, supported with the abilities of the PCs. Since the armies were equal for the most part, this meant that character abilities made the difference in the size of the dice pools. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of my favorite moments was when the shark contingent, lead by Ralph's character, blew their roll to augment, and instead of adding dice, subtracted one die from their army as a whole... this balanced out the advantage that the three players had against the one, and was narrated by Ralph as the shark-men being distracted by the release of many small prey fish which they promptly chased down for dinner, ignoring the rest of the battle. Laughed my ass off. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the good questions!<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139650/#Comment_139650" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T16:25:44+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  4:25PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The vile blue sinuous finned people, known by my people as "Food" were played by Tod Olsen, who having watched me create Blood Monger Jawrek Torn (the War Oracle who fortells the outcome of battle by cutting the arms off of starfish and reading the future in how they grow back) promptly made himself my enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile he did manage to kill the mighty Blood Monger Jawrek at the end, it was not before I ate him.<br/>\n<br/>\nI claim victory!<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139651/#Comment_139651" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-14T16:34:19+00:00" title="April 14, 2008  4:34PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm so ticked I missed out on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Tweaker" title="The Tweaker"><img alt="The Tweaker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Tweaker">The Tweaker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139741/#Comment_139741" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T09:02:34+00:00" title="April 15, 2008  9:02AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Mike, what dice did you finally use (d20s, then?), and how does the dice rolling mechanism works?

I thought about running it whenever I saw you, but there was always something else going on. When the game started, I suddenly had too many players, and didn't have the heart to turn any away (and I'm not sure if you were busy or not at the time). <br>\n<br>\nI owe you one. Origins? GenCon? <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlfredo, great questions,<br>\n<br/>\nI ended up using the D20 method, I admit, but mostly because I didn't have a copy of the rules on hand, and didn't think that I could run the percentile method accurately. Actually it's a tribute to the simplicity of that system that I almost did use it from my memory of it - I've only played with it once before. As opposed to the many games I've run using my system. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as a playtest, we don't know anything more about the dice system than before. And, frankly, I wanted the game to be a demo, very specifically. That is, it was short-ish... 2 hours? 3? And meant to be a taster, not to get really involved. As such I didn't even formally take feedback. Though, as always, any feedback from the players would be appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want to go into too much specifics with the die pool methods, but it's basically like this:<br/>\n - D20 Method (won't be in the playtest copy) - roll a pool of d20s equal to one tenth your rating, plus a non-rolled die for any fraction, and high die wins. Multiple dice that exceed your opponents means higher levels of success. <br/>\n<br/>\n - Percentile system - Simply add the ratings to a roll of percentile dice, and subtract the opponents rating plus roll. The margin determines the level of victory. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n"Augmenting" is now "supporting" (we changed the term for various reasons). Its very similar to HQ, with one tweak being that the first ability you support with counts at half it's rating. Everything after that is one-tenth. Note that the effect this has, we've found, is to make the one-tenth augments seem to approach superflousness. Meaning that players don't spend a ton of time looking for them, just a few for color. A simply psychological trick. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are rules for rolling over victories from previous contests in terms of temporary abilities... this means that there's now only one rule for both gaining abilities (and flaws, etc) and "variable augments." Covers this sort of thing and all of those odd rules like "Heroforming" that you had in HQ. Much more streamlined, and you can still get whatever level of mechanical complexity you like. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139756/#Comment_139756" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T10:24:59+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 10:24AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was zero "initial brainstorming and character generation process." Again, this is not the default style of play, just one I commonly use myself when I don't have stuff prepped. But, to be clear, play began with sheets of paper that were blank except for markings for blank templates to be filled in, and the opening dialog went something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nMike: Matt, name a biome. <br/>\nMatt: A what? <br/>\nMike: an environment, like forest or something. <br/>\nMatt: OK, forest. <br/>\nMike: can you add something? Like Conniferous or deciduous? <br/>\nMatt: Deciduous. You're lucky, I was going to say underwater. <br/>\nMike: Oooh, I've never done underwater, can we do underwater instead!!!<br/>\n[Murmurs of enthusiasm from around the table]<br/>\nMatt: sure. <br/>\nMike: Cool... Tony, your character peeks out from inside of a bed of kelp, what does he look like? Three things.<br/>\nTony: he's blue, sinuous, and scaled<br/>\nMike: OK, so he's not human, I take it? You probably want to note that as a trademark for his species. Put any abilities that he has because he's a member of that species under that trademark. <br/>\n<br/>\nEtc. The other players are asked to simply describe their characters. At some point somebody has their character actually do something with the environment. In this case I describe Ralph's character as being by a stone altar, being watched by Tony's character. Immediately Ralph figures that his shark-headed character is cutting up a starfish. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike: So does that say something about his occupation? <br/>\nRalph: Yeaaah... he's a... War Oracle.....<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the other players decide that their characters are a general, a spy, a spymaster. More traits get added as play goes on, and we find out that Tony's race hates Ralph's... hence why he's spying on Ralph's character. Suddenly the game is all about an imminent battle between their races...<br/>\n<br/>\nNo prep. Just questions in play that lead players to make stuff up about their characters, which, in turn defines the world. This is key...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers, by creating the character they want to play, shape the world of play. They aren't given "Director Stance" authority directly, they are given the authority to make up whatever they want about their character. But in being given full authority to do so as long as it doesn't conflict with what the other players are doing (or with agreed upon setting info in a game that has that), the players are given ownership of much of the setting. A "cone" of authority, if you will, that descends from their work in creating an interesting character. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis can be done before play, yes, but it can also happen during play at any time. If the player is allowed to add an ability, or otherwise define his character, he's modifying the world as he does so. Note that, to begin with, you have grandios numbers of free abilities you can add to a character (typically from 50 to 80 depending on how wierd you want the setting to be), so you can go a long way in creating things before slowing down as things sorta solidify and "gel" if you will. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that with a more pre-prepared world, you usually still have such lattitude, but may decide to relinquish some of it, and just select from what's presented, and not feel forced to be creative. It's up to the player to decide how much they want to add (in my radical form, I force them to create everything, but, again, that's just one way to play). <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued again...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_139757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139757/#Comment_139757" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T10:25:13+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 10:25AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n"Trademarks" are a sort of "Template." To be clear, Templates are what's replacing keywords. In fact, I'm not really comfortable with that term, either, truth be told. We need a term that means:<br/>\n<br/>\nA grouping of abilities that represent different important types of facets of the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think we even tossed around "facets" or something, and didn't like that. Any ideas? <br/>\n<br/>\nTrademarks are a specific meta-category of template that is tailored for the character. This is a bit complicated, but basically every Template has the following qualities:<br/>\nMeta-category: Is it a standard template, the sort that shows how he is like others, thus defining the world? Or is it something unique to the character (either totally, or he's one of a select group that has it)? <br/>\nDefinition: Inside of those categories, you have an infinite number of actual selections you can make. They are only constrained by whether or not the category itself shows commonality, or individuality, or the like. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for instance, you will usually have a culture for your character. This is one of those standard linking sorts of keywords. But you're free to make up your culture, or select from any available in the game world. By putting abilities in such a keyword, you define large sections of the world. On the other hand, a Trademark is something that is probably pretty rare, and perhaps even unique to your character. Only he owns the Blade of Pure Truth, for instance. The trademark template here serves to better define this quality of the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nMark's text uses better terms and makes this all a lot more clear with good examples to back it up, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Tweaker" title="The Tweaker"><img alt="The Tweaker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Tweaker">The Tweaker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139769/#Comment_139769" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T11:19:22+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 11:19AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is getting really interesting, Mike.

Also, the 'supporting' trick (adding one-half of the first supporting ability and one-tenth of other abilities) is a nice Jedi mind trick, even though I wonder if players won't find it limiting :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, you can define the world at large through the characters, who have two kinds of 'templates' - 'Facets' (which can be either cultural or personal features, for lack of a better name) and 'Trademarks' (highly character-specific features).

I knew I was being unclear, and the answers reflect that. That said, they are like a brainstorming session on the structure as a whole, so it's fascinating. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo try to clarify the structure as it stands, a character is compose of several "Templates" right now. There is nothing outside of one of these areas to list abilities. And tha's what's in templates, abilities. As in HQ, these can be anything, including equipment, and specifically include personality traits and relationships (some of the slots require these). <br/>\n<br/>\nTemplates can be pre-specified. Often, or even usually, you'll have the standard pair of Culture and Occupation. That's the category of template, and the template is specified as being one specific culture or occupation. So my character's Occupation Template may be a Warrior templete, for example. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then there's a template called Individuality which is not specified, it's the same for everyone in that it's "Parts of your character that are not part of some other template." Then there's Trademarks which are groupings of abilities that the player specifies, but which have no constraint other than genre. They don't have to be any specific sort of template. So I my warrior might have a Sword of the Ages Trademark Template. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny clearer? <br/>\n<br/>\nI kinda like Loci as a term for these. To be clear, however, Trademark is a term we're very happy with. It says exactly what it means to say. This is something the character has that makes him stand out from the crowd, in an identifiable way. It may not be unique to the character, or it may, but it's distinctive. Like Chewbacca being a Wookie, Scaramanga is the man with the Golden Gun, Batman has Robin, Arthur has Excalibur... each of these things are part of the identity of the character by which we most strongly identify them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI included the Wookie example intentionally. Wookie is the a species trademark here. Varies from a cultural one, in that there could be many cultures made of Wookies, just as there are many cultures of humans. Yet it's not unique to Chewbacca. And, yet, it's still the most identifiable thing about Chewbacca. Oh, sure, Chewie is a navigator, and has another trademark, the crossbow blaster. But the most important fact about a wookie is that they might tear your arm off if you win a game against them. Because they're a wookie. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140128/#Comment_140128" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T20:42:54+00:00" title="April 16, 2008  8:42PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2008 8:47PM by Valamir.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tod...Tod's character was hiding in the kelp. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm really looking foward to Other Worlds.  I'm also really looking forward to further refinement of the d20 method because marrying something so cool to something as intrinsically crappy as %iles with math strikes me as a fine way to torpedo a design.  But then I've long harbored an overzealous resentment of the misleading false precision of %ile dice so that may just be bias talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did want to talk a bit more about the d20 system we were using.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one point you said something to the effect of "never take away dice, only ever add, more dice means more possibility for extreme results".<br/>\n<br/>\nPondering that I'm not sure that that's true.  Since you're using a modified Sorcerer mechanic (count each die of the winner that rolls higher than the loser's best) I think actually that more dice decrease the odds of an extreme result.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going off of "gut math" as opposed to real math here, but it strikes me that to get multiple successes the winner must roll multiple high dice.  To prevent the winner from getting multiple successes the loser needs only 1 really high die.  As dice get added to both sides the odds of each side getting at least 1 high die to block an opponent's multiple successes should be increasing faster than the odd of getting multiple high dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd be surprised if your really big pools ever gave more than 1 success (or just 2 or three at most).  I think every time we rolled, we got only 1 success.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking that after a certain point...the point at which your pool is big enough to reliably roll a 19 or 20, additional dice would be most effective reducing the opponent's dice...and thus reducing their chance of getting a solo high die to block you...if your goal is to have a good chance to get multiple successes you might want to consider that option.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option that I kind of like is to allow the winner to trade consequences.  Say I roll really good, and you got a 19 in a pool that's otherwise crap.   Dang...I get only 1 success out of this.  BUT, I accept 1 "consequence" and gain the power to discard your high die...now you're faced with 4 or 5 successes because you have no backers to that 19, but I didn't get off scot-free either.  I don't know what that "consequence" might be...a narrative complication that you get to saddle me with...the equivelent of you getting a single die success against me...whatever.  But it would essentially help deal with the "single big lucky roll" (or even couple big lucky rolls if you allowed multiple consequences) effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140131/#Comment_140131" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-16T22:17:17+00:00" title="April 16, 2008 10:17PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2008 10:29PM by Hexabolic.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say that rolling a bunch of d20s holds very little appeal for me.

In which case maybe it's more palatable? But a typical character, after counting in all of his support, might roll 4 d20 in a typical contest. With the higher than normal characters we were playing with at Forge Con, we would typically have 7 d20 in a contest. With more powerful characters, I've seen pools as high as about 12 dice at times, I think. But I also think that this was before we had our current scheme for support figures. So I don't know that we'll see that again. <br>\n<br>\nIt's not as many dice as Dunjon. I managed to scale things down in part because of critiques of that system. Is that still too many dice? Or does that ameliorate some of the concern? Or is it not the number of dice at all that concern you? <br>\n<br>\nAs you your concern, Ralph, about my design goal for the system, I sorta over-stated things. That is, the math is interesting. It was actually Walt that set me straight on part of this (I knew how to do the math, I had just never actually done it, and made wrong assumptions). I'm really not interested so much in wild results happening a lot. I like that they might be rare. What I prefer, really, is that the winner be pretty randomized, and lots of dice tend to do that... the more you roll on both sides, the less certain you are of who will win. And, actually, the number of likely successes also increases overall. The propensity of a bell curve to push the results inward decreases the likely range more slowly than the range itself increases. The standard deviation increases as you get more dice. Not proportionally, no, but slightly. This seems pretty optimal to me. We have slightly more "wild" outcomes with more dice. <br>\n<br>\nBut what I was really on about is that the range is wider. That is, it's simply more possible in theory for one to get a really wild result with a lot of dice. And, what's more, with the way the curve works, it's actually somewhat likely. <br>\n<br>\nNote that, in fact, the rule is that you cancel tied dice (not sure if you were aware of that). So, yeah, when you have a lot of dice, and you tend to have some high results, a lot of times you'll have to 20s out there that cancel, and then one guy drops to a 14, and the other has three dice above that 14 for three successes. Our game happened to produce one and two die level successes, but I've seen more in play, and quite frequently. That said, the curve makes it so that really outrageous results like a 5 die win *are* really rare. Which is fun to me, because when they do occur they *will* be special. (Ties are even rarer, almost impossible... I may have to fix that). <br>\n<br>\nSo it seems to do what I want it to do fairly well. In fact the problem that I have with the system in some ways is that when rolling low dice pools, the stakes are low. I've considered giving each side a few "base dice" to counter this somewhat, but that's non-optimal. <br>\n<br>\nOh, and your idea about cancelling dice by taking consequences? I already had something like that, but only for the tied dice. I'll have to consider your version. The version I like is allowing the player to "increase the stakes" by stating before hand how many dice of his opponent's he's willing to "take" to get the level of victory that he wants. That way we don't know before the roll if he will take any... he might get that level of victory based on the roll alone. With my version they can only ignore ties, and so that means that the actual level of victory is randomized. With your version, they would be able to ensure success at a certain level, and only the cost would be random. I think I like mine better, but yours is more dramatic. What would be really cool would be something in between that didn't rely on uncommon tied dice. So consequences would be more frequent, yet the level of victory would still be random. Hmmm....<br>\n<br/>\nAs for the repercussions of something like this, it simply follows the standard system... which I now realize I completely forgot to employ in play at the Con. But, essentially, every contest may result in one side or the other getting a new temporary trait - often a flaw for the loser. Basically if you take consequences, you are simply allowing the opponent to tag you with a new trait. The level of the ability of the trait is based on the abilities you used to inflict it, and the level of victory rolled. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this said, the playtest version is going out with percentiles. I don't know if that'll ever change to the D20 system, or some other, but that's as it stands. I'll answer concerns about that below...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140170/#Comment_140170" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T06:30:37+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  6:30AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2008 6:37AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To deal with your concern, Ralph, the percentile system is less about giving an impression of precision than it is with dealing with the actual precision of the abilities we have. Our range of abilities goes into the hundreds, so you need to have percentile dice simply so the math works out. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, the problem here that we've considered is whether or not the level of precision of the abilities is useful. Even with the D20 system, it means that you end up with that "fraction die" which seems sorta... vestigial... at times. It's interesting when that die affects resolution, but it's rare. There are three reasons for the precision:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) We're geeks, we like that we can compare our characters ten times as accurately. There, I've said it. There are times when I'm playing a game where I have one through ten as potential ratings that I'm feel very strongly that I should take a 4.5. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) It's important for the support math. Otherwise you'd be adding up fractions. We're just eliminating the fractional accounting. (In doing the "dice math" for the D20 system, you'd be doing <br/>\n<br/>\n3) It makes for potential incremental advancement, again without resorting to fractions. This one may be geekery as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure there are other positive effects as well that I'm not recalling. Anyhow, the precision of the abilities drives the precision of the dice. So percentile dice seem justified here. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it still sound like "false precision" to you? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, the percentile system is simpler to use, quite clearly. I think it might lack some of the quirks of the D20 system that I like, but it also lacks any of the bad quirks as well (like requiring a large number of D20s in order to play efficiently). Also what you're not aware of is that there are some interesting rules with the percentile dice system like "reversing the polarity" which is something like the flip-flops from UA (or whatever that system calls em). Stuff like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice it seems to have worked fine. But that's why we're going into playtesting. To get past our own observations, and get others. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf somebody has any ideas for a system that accomplishes the following, I'd love to hear it:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Uses common dice in common amounts. <br/>\n2) Takes into account the precision of the system. <br/>\n3) Produces multiple levels of victory/defeat. <br/>\n4) Has an interesting curve in terms of chances of the levels coming up. <br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of playtesting, we decided to enter one last round of small revisions, which is why the playtest copy is not out yet. But we have a deadline set by which it will be out. No, I won't say what that is. Only that it won't be long now (I know, I've been saying that for quite a while!).  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140260/#Comment_140260" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-17T15:11:35+00:00" title="April 17, 2008  3:11PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Mike.  I have found that in practice comparing dice a la Sorcerer can be a little slow in terms of handling time.  The smaller die pools you've discussed might ameliorate that concern.  I tried this particular mechanic in my hybrid Wushu game with d6 pools that varied between 7 and 14 ('cause, you know, <i>Exalted</i>), and it did get a little tedious.  Part of that may have resulted from the large number of ties.<br/><br/>The percentile with flip-flop mechanics sounds intriguing.  I've always wanted to find a percentile system I liked.  Aside from the interesting <i>Exile</i> mechanic, I haven't found that yet.  For me, I think the presence of a % element seems to undermine my...I dunno, sense of zeitgeist in the fictional environment.  Put another way, it pushes my mindset into pawn stance.  I'd very much like to see what you have.  I'm converting my Ars Magica game to Heroquest, and though in some ways it's a surprisingly good fit, in others it's presenting a challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140304/#Comment_140304" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T06:33:58+00:00" title="April 18, 2008  6:33AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh. For "percentile dice" does it help if we call it a d100 instead? Or is the number 100 simply too "metric?" <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the d20 method, the system of comparison goes like this:<br/>\n1) find each side's high die.<br/>\n2) Compare these dice. <br/>\n A) if they are tied, discard (or use the special rule above), and look for the next highest. <br/>\n B) for the side that has the higher die, count all dice higher than the opponent's high die. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith D10s we had significant numbers of tied dice, yes. But with D20s, these are actually somewhat rare. So often you just go straight to B. Meaning that it's one comparison, and then one count of comparisons. Seems to work out pretty quickly in practice, from what I've seen. Of course I might just be too close to it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's definitely not any longer than HQ's system. Where you have to do comparisons to a target number, and then compare the results of those comparisons on a chart. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the d100 system, there is a double-digit math step, which some people mind, and others do not. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, remember, each roll in this game resolves an entire contest. No "soak" rolls following the initial rolls. Well... actually you can do stuff like this, rolling one victory into the next, but you only do so to the extent that you're interested in doing so. There's no particular incentive to do so, other than player interest, which automatically justifies the roll. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice we roll pretty infrequently. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's far more time consuming, and what people report as frustrating sometimes, is the support math, adding up abilities. With these you have to do a division step, with rounding, and then an addition step, for each and every ability you want to use to support. My hope is that people are willing to put in the work to get in the abilities they think are interesting. And, actually, if they're disincentivized from adding tons of abilities in because of the math, I think this balances things out pretty nicely. The system says, "OK, we'll give you that if you want to do the work, but if it's not worth the work to you, don't put it in." <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the theory, anyhow. I'm sure experiences will vary, and I'd love to hear from folks on that subject. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140379/#Comment_140379" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-18T13:13:10+00:00" title="April 18, 2008  1:13PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A 1/10 division step is trivial, so I don't worry about that.  1/4 shouldn't be too much hassle, either.  I'll find out in my HQ conversion how that works since 4 of 5 of my players are math-aversive.

As for handling time, I agree simple 1/10 or 1/4 division shouldn't be a problem.<br/><br/>I am still thinking about the number and type of Templates which might make up a character and the distinction between species and cultural templates. I believe Worf - from Star Trek TNG - would be a clearer example than Chewbacca: you have a Klingon who happens to have been raised in the Federation by a human family. If you were to stat up Worf as an Other Worlds character, I suppose it would go this way (in no particular order):<br/><br/>- <b>Species template</b> - Typical Klingon abilities, relationships and character traits, such as Resilient, Redundant Physiology, Mean, Vengeful, House of Mogh, Enemy of House Duras, etc.<br/>- <b>Culture template</b> - A very unusual mix of typical Human/Federation and Klingon cultural abilities and traits, as Worf is a Klingon who also has human values (such as compassion, theoretically absent from the Klingon mindset) and is familiar with human customs. This would also include Worf's relationship with his Human and his Klingon family.<br/>- <b>Occupation template</b> - Abilities and personality traits of a typical Starfleet officer (general procedures, knowledge of Starfleet regulations, fidelity to the 'Fleet, relationship with other officers).

Got it. That's really what we're intending, and dice preferences be damned. Basically we'll see what happens in playtest, and go with what works in practice. <br>\n<br>\nWhorf is, indeed, a good example. <br>\n<br>\nRalph's interpretation seems pretty good. But remember that there's some judgment involved here, and no really hard and fast rule for where something must go. Basically with an ability, I ask the questions:<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it something that everybody in your character's culture knows how to do? If so, then it goes in Culture.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it something that everybody who share's your character's occupation knows how to do? If so, then it goes in Occupation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs it something inborn that not all humans have as an ability, or is unusual? Then it goes in a defined Species Trademark. <br/>\n<br/>\nBatleth is an interesting case. The question is really something like, "Does the batleth, itself, have personality?" And "Does Whorf have a definable relationship with his batleth?" <br/>\n<br/>\nBy answering the above questions, you create the world as you go, and show how your character fits into it, and also how he varies from the norm. As such, I can see House of Mogh being an individuality thing, or being an entire Trademark if you wanted to work it out in that sort of depth. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, batleth could be a cultural trait for cultural Klingons. Perhaps they all do learn how to use it. This is particularly believable for Klingons. On the other hand, perhaps it's only something that Klingon Warriors learn. In that case, it goes in warrior. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in Whorf's case, it's neither - he isn't culturally Klingon. He distinctly did not learn the batleth as part of being raised by Klingons. He learned it after the fact from an interest in his ethnic heritage. I would make his Culture keyword "Federation" like everyone else's on the Enterprise. Then his Batleth skill would be either part of his Individuality "template" or, if you really think that it makes sense, as a Trademark. <br/>\n<br/>\nI probably, if I were making up Whorf, would not make it a trademark. But that's just me. Jordi Laforge's "visor," on the other hand, is definitely a trademark. It defines the character. Whorf's species is definitely a trademark, he's that big-bad Klingon. It is, in fact, the tension between Whorf's cultural template and his species trademark that make his character so interesting. <br/>\n<br/>\n(You see this too much in fantasy games with the "Half-elf," but it's definitely a fun issue to play around with)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, if the batleth is a Trademark, then he probably still has the skill in "Individuality." You can have the skill there, and all of the other stuff that goes with the batleth in the Trademark for it. So basically if Whorf is bereft of it, he loses those Trademark abilities, but still has the skill. Which he uses all the time in unarmed combat. <br/>\n<br/>\nTwo trademarks is the maximum, and only really used when you want the game to be quite fantastical or adventurous. If you're looking to play in a world with a genre that's rather "realistic" then you may have zero trademarks, in fact. I rather prefer to play with two trademarks, and I think many gamers will, but constraint to less is important if you're really not trying to import dramatic conventions like cowboy trick gun shooting BS, or superpowers, or magic. <br/>\n<br/>\n Mike                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Tweaker" title="The Tweaker"><img alt="The Tweaker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Tweaker">The Tweaker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140644/#Comment_140644" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T08:10:53+00:00" title="April 21, 2008  8:10AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the input, Ralph.

SotC probably gives a good example of a story lens, where you ground the chargen decisions based more on the backstory of the individual character rather than starting from whether it's internally consistent in the world, which to me would be a world lens.<br/><br/>Worf's hybrid culture does make him an interesting example.  My way of doing that might be either to let the player stitch together a hybrid culture with some trademark consequences derived from that hybridization, or to have the player pick one culture and then place the other culture's traits in the Trademark area, since they'd be (if I understand the design concept behind Trademark correctly) highly individualized, unique traits when contrasted with his cultural background.<br/><br/><i>On a definite side note: </i>Ran my Ars Magica Heroquest conversion for the first time last night, and even though we only had a couple of minor contests, the experience with the mechanics was sweet, sweet relief for me.

The text speaks mostly on how you can come up with a world before hand. As such, that means that players who don't find it interesting to make up this stuff will have lots of stock templates from which to choose. These can have more or less detail built into them, from fully-fleshed out, to just being the template title. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it seeks to fulfil both the player who wants a sense that he's plugging in, and the player who wants to be creating parts of the setting. Depending on how you implement play. I think that they typical mode will be to have some templates thought out before hand (or even referenced from materials in the book or online), and then the rest be constructed as you play by those interested in doing so. Players like Matt above, who really get into that sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, with regards to Lenny's comments, you may note that one of my biggest influences for how I adapted HQ (and thence how we've made Other Worlds) is my play of FATE. I would distort that game way out of shape, having categories of Aspects that conform to the world-building stuff that I like, in an attempt to make the system go from being "notional" about characters in the story-fashion you identify above, to the sort of "we can discern everything about the character if we want" mode that I like, which you correctly equate to world-building. <br/>\n<br/>\nDon't get me wrong, I think that FATE is perfect for the sort of play you're going to get from Spirit of the Century. But for the sort of investigative fantasy play or sci-fi in which I'm interested, I need things to be less "literate" and more "in-game" if you will. Somewhat more. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the text hopefully conveys regarding templates is that they're not, "What I learned while part of X." It's easy to fall into that trap. They're "what everyone else with this template has." So... if I'm in the military, and I get assigned to cooking duties, then I shouldn't be taking "cooking" in my "Soldier" occupation keyword. Not unless the military organization in question has everybody rotate through cooking duty. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if my occupation is defined as "Military Cook," and this is not some incidental duty that just happened to be uniquely assigned to me... if there are other Military Cooks (or even if there could have been, but there just didn't happen to be any)... then I can make that my profession. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, templates like occupation and culture exist to show how your character is similar to other classes of people in the game world. Individuality and some trademarks exist to show how your character varies from the other types of people with whom he is associated. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne reason for this, by the way, is that once you've created a template like an occupation, then it exists as an example to be used for any other PC or NPC who has that similarity. So you can then create similar characters by plug-in. Mechanically what this does, too, is make it so that the player will have an idea of what to expect from those things that he shares templates with. Or even ones he's read about. Does his culture have "Prejudiced Against Goblins?" Then he will realize that he'll probably be up against that, mechanically, when his character who is trying to overcome his own predjudice against goblins tries to get his new goblin friend a job at home. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou get the idea. Templates become a quick reference for what those elements of the world are like. In addition to defining the character as being a part of the world. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf/when you make Templates "What my character learned as a soldier" or the like, what happens is that you don't then neccessarily know anything much about the world other than that, somehow, this character developed inside of it. Meaning he may be typical... or maybe he's not. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, plenty of room in the "Individuality" category for you to customize your character, and show where he varies from the norm. Important to worldbuilding, too (in addition to simply making a fun protagonist), because it shows the sorts of variations that can and have happened in the world, and, perhaps, you can then investigate how odd these things are, or if they're part of the expected norms of variance. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_140679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140679/#Comment_140679" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T11:51:28+00:00" title="April 21, 2008 11:51AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S. Blake, glad to hear your game went well. It's interesting to me that I balked at Ars Magica's magic system because it seemed to be handwavey. I realize now that the problem was that it was "half-handwavey." That is, the noun-verb system seemed like it was a hard-constructed system to an extent. But then there was always that "GM just decides difficulty" step that followed. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's interesting to me that, if you just make it "handwavey" from step one, that it all feels right. Rather, it's not handwavey until you have something to deal with and then handwave it. If you don't set up that structure only to ignore it afterwards, there's nothing to handwave away with the arbitrary judgment. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr at least that's been my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140713/#Comment_140713" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-21T15:55:23+00:00" title="April 21, 2008  3:55PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2008 3:56PM by Hexabolic.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/><br/>Thanks for the illuminating comments on templates.  I look forward to tinkering with them, and I like the notion of templates in the first place.  They look like a great shorthand for plugging characters into a game.<br/><br/>I suspect folks will look to your (plural "you" for all OtherWorlds designers) take as the default approach.  It's fine to have a default and to encourage variations and different directions.  In fact, I see that as true for any game.  There's the default alongside the kijillion other equally valid ways of play.  Put another way, a default establishes a metric for mutated play.<br/><br/>I ought to start a thread on the Ars-HQ game rather than risk a threadjack.  I've been wanting to play HQ for a long time, and last night's small glimpses of the possible play is stirring excitement I haven't felt since, well, since getting into DnD in the first place, lo these many aeons ago.  But I will say that considerable fuel for my interest in <i>OtherWorlds</i> comes from having participated in your FATE Shimmering Seas game and following your philosophy about HQ over the years.  Last night's experience underlines how much I'd like to get my hands on something like OtherWorlds.<br/><br/>Naturally, your sparkly personality adds a compelling selling point.

I know, I liked em too, and how some of the dice mechanics were funky in a good way. But we're looking to try to reduce handling time, and the first order of business there was to get rid of the quirky base-20 notation system that made every single math step just that much more difficult. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere's still a scale with a definite sense of levels that includes the sorts of definitions that existed with the masteries system. It's just handled now with straightforward ratings. The scale itself hasn't changed a lot, but we tend to think more in terms of what each ten points changes, rather than what each 20 points changes. More focus on the human end of the scales. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_140949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The%20Tweaker" title="The Tweaker"><img alt="The Tweaker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The%20Tweaker">The Tweaker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/140949/#Comment_140949" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-23T10:20:03+00:00" title="April 23, 2008 10:20AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Mike.

Which silence, I hope, says something...<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I formerly was pretty bad at public speaking, but two things worked to ameliorate that in this case. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, Clyde really is a good interviewer. He made me feel comfortable, at least. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I've been reading books aloud to my children. Believe it or not, that's made it a lot easier for me to get concepts out more coherently than I have been able to do so in the past. Not sure why exactly, but I'm pretty sure it's helped a lot. So I highly recommend it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I don't sound like an idiot in the interview, it's likely because of those two things working together. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo get back on topic, what's interesting about a good interview is that you get some ideas out that you never managed to form coherently in your head previously (as I mentioned to Clyde, this is Charlie Rose's genius). Meaning that a lot of what I said in that interview is helping me going forward with Other Worlds, and other design considerations. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody else care to do me the favor of interviewing me? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144048/#Comment_144048" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T15:01:13+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  3:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 3:01PM by Denys.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>as for the repercussions of something like this, it simply follows the standard system... which I now realize I completely forgot to employ in play at the Con. But, essentially, every contest may result in one side or the other getting a new temporary trait - often a flaw for the loser. Basically if you take consequences, you are simply allowing the opponent to tag you with a new trait. The level of the ability of the trait is based on the abilities you used to inflict it, and the level of victory rolled.<br/></blockquote>\nMike -- I know you guys are still putting the playtest doc together but when re-reading this thread, I was curious about the excerpt above.

Basically the GM may decide to give the loser in a contest a flaw based on their opponent's rating. The duration of the flaw (it's permanency) and such are determined by the level of defeat. <br/>\n<br/>\nConversely, at the same time, the winner may elect to buy an ability based on the nature of the contest as well, based on his opponent's total rating (we like that taking on a higher risk means higher reward potential). These are temporary unless further points are spent to make them permanent. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo winning a tactics contest on approach to an enemy might gain you a temporary ability like "Upper Hand" which can be used to augment in the actual engagement. Again, this covers "Variable Augments." Or a character might shapeshift to a wolf form with "Claws" ability he can use in a fight, only to have this fade in a while. Unless he pays to permanently adopt the wolf form as something he can use at any time. Or a player could have a contest over obtaining a Death Ray, paying to get the ray from his win. This will fade, the gun going to the authorities or whatever, unless the player pays for it to be permanent. <br/>\n<br/>\nThink Hero System purchasing of abilities, except there's an intermediate stage that also has to be paid for. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother fun effect of this system is that it means that incremental character advancement is replaced by getting whole abilities at a relatively "full" level of competence. This is something that people clamored for with HQ, and we've solved that problem. Using one system that covers both angles of abilities as "situational modifiers" and "character advancement."<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144225/#Comment_144225" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T13:02:19+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  1:02PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>Another fun effect of this system is that it means that incremental character advancement is replaced by getting whole abilities at a relatively "full" level of competence.
