It must relate to them being a magician. It can just be a little bit of colour, and epic ritual, or some obscure spell combo.<br/><br/>For example, one magician devised a spell which enabled them to communicate with people in stasis, by entering a mental landscape under their control. Later, a group of adventurers used this spell for some aggressive psychoanalysis on a fellow party member.<br/><br/>Another magician absolutely refused to use any manual implement to perform labour, insisting on using magic even if peeling an apple.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345557/#Comment_345557" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T09:40:31+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  9:40AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A magician in a campaign I ran spent weeks researching a teleport spell and only ever used it to teleport into a womans room to smother her with a pillow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345558/#Comment_345558" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T09:46:16+00:00" title="October 11, 2011  9:46AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Burning Wheel my weather witch miscast a spell that ended up cursing him.
