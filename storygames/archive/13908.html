It was my first published design. I have a handful of decks still for sale. I think there are eight in a box, as of this week.</p>\n<p>In it, you play the toys that belong to a child. Those toys are made of personality traits, drawn from a deck. They're traits like "brave", "calm", or "ugly". You use those cards to describe your toy; "Sharp, selfish, and beautiful" might be "Legal Action Barbie", for instance.</p>\n<p>As a group, you create a child and their environment from the childhoods at the table. As written, you make up any time, but I think if a group hasn't played together before, it should be in the era of the youngest person at the table. The rules also recommend a fantastic element \u2014\xa0the initial inspiration was The Wizard of Oz \u2014\xa0but you can make it as realistic as you like. I have a caveat, though: the fantasy is there for a reason. Without it, you're just detailing a real threat to a child. Some players have benefited from that kind of play, but I don't recommend it until you've played a few times and know how the game goes. It might not be worth it. I've never enjoyed playing like that.</p>\n<p>As part of that process, you establish a Story Goal for the child: what she wants, or what you want for her, in the course of events. What they toys want, though, is to become the favorite toy. That toy will represent the child after the end of the story, giving its personality traits to the child as the proven best way for the kid to confront the world.</p>\n<p>You have a bag containing a colored coin (we use glass beads) for each player, representing how beloved their toy is. To start the game, you draw a bead. Whoever's color it is, starts detailing the situation in ways that would benefit them if their toy were the one addressing it. They won't be able to, though; they're pitching the story to someone else, chosen by bead selection. You detail it as appropriate to your character because it makes it less likely for anyone else to succeed \u2014\xa0no two toys have the same personality traits.</p>\n<p>Each of those trait cards is worth a die. When it's your turn, you put a die on each card and pick them up as you use them to address a challenge to the wellbeing of the child. The player who issued the challenge rolls as many dice as they have beads. The highest single die wins the challenge. If the toy loses, they lose a bead. When they have no more beads, their toy is lost. The person who issues the challenge issues another challenge and a new bead is drawn for a new toy to face that challenge.</p>\n<p>When the toy wins, the player has an option: choose one of three cards face-up on the table, or add another coin to the bag, making yourself more favorite.</p>\n<p>The game goes until one toy is has 8 favorite coins, at which point all challenges are about the Story Goal. Since the favorite toy is most likely to be chosen, they have the greatest chances to gain cards, as well; and since that player has the most coins, they are throwing a lot of dice during challenges. But the reason they're dice is because they're fickle!</p>\n<p>I've got eight decks left over from Dreamation. As you may have noticed, it doesn't get talked about much any more, mostly because it ran into a weird marketing problem. There are also rules that it has that I've learned from and do differently now, but those rules worked to good effect, as well. I've never figured out how to get the good without the bad of them.</p>\n<p>Ben Lehman wrote a supplement to it called <a href="http://swingpad.com/dustyboots/wordpress/index.php?page_id=245" rel="nofollow">Journeying West</a>, where the "child" is Tripitaka and the toys are Monkey, Sandy, Piggy, and Horse (or something like them, depending on what you draw). It's clever, as you'd expect from Ben. He's also working on a game called Clover, which is, in many ways, the opposite of Under the Bed, about an unusual but joyous and self-reliant little girl.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315293/#Comment_315293" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T10:43:51+00:00" title="March  3, 2011 10:43AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool, how do I get one?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
