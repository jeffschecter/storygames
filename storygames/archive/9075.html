To quote the author's play example:<br/><br/><span style="color: #000066;">Puppet Master: "And then, the door burst down! Three nutcrackers stood there, one of them still chomping on the doorknob. 'Stop, you mangy puppets!' cried one."<br/><br/>Actor 1: "Run! Run out the back door! We must escape the nutcrackers!"<br/><br/>Actor 2: "Where is that rock? Here it is! I shall hurl this rock and smash your greedy mouth, nutcracker!"<br/><br/>Puppet Master: "The rock flew across the room and hit the first nutcracker in the jaw. 'Rmmf!' cried the injured nutcracker. 'He cannot bite nor chomp!' cried another. And he was right: the nutcracker's jaw was broken in two."</span><br/><br/>I've played IAWA and Shock: once each.  I think both of those sessions would have been enhanced by this approach, coming out as tales one might write, read, or speak to an audience, bard-style.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200737/#Comment_200737" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-05T09:57:48+00:00" title="April  5, 2009  9:57AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly, I was just talking to Shreyas about playtesting Daniel Solis' upcoming game, <a href="http://www.danielsolis.com/do/" rel="nofollow">Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple</a>, and a related issue came up. Apparently, in the most recent draft, Daniel was trying to get the players to narrate things happening instead of roleplaying the characters doing stuff and some of the players found this distancing and a bit awkward, feeling stuck in director stance without being about to enjoy being the characters.<br/><br/>But, yeah, there's definitely something interesting that happens when you can have the whole narrative framed as a story that you're reading or telling instead of something that's happening right now, in the present tense.  The past-tense thing from Puppetland is definitely an early exploration of that kind of idea.  I do think that, like in the <i>Do</i> playtests, finding some way to allow players to shift out of director stance (which does look like it happens in your example, with the Puppet Master mostly being the one focusing on past tense) may be necessary in some cases.  Or maybe it would just involve a lot of practice, so you can feel comfortable shifting between stances/tenses with declarations like:<br/><br/>"Phillipe ran for the door, with the panther right behind him.  Suddenly, he remembered his magic amulet. 'I knew this would come in handy!'  He turned and pulled it from around his neck..."<br/><br/>That's not the kind of thing that comes naturally in many roleplaying styles, so it might take a while, if the group really hopes to cultivate it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200745/#Comment_200745" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-05T11:10:13+00:00" title="April  5, 2009 11:10AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Jon, the rule in Puppetland is "The only thing players can say is what the characters say."

The most helpful technique I evolved was when I began to show up with a bag of puppets, mostly finger and hand, picked up cheap on random trips to craft shows/IKEA/toy stores/etc, and to have the players each pick one out.  We then played in a LARP-ish way.  There were not a lot of props, no backgrounds except when someone was moved to sketch one, and some of the GM characters were not represented by appropriate puppets, so it wasn't quite up to the usual LARP level.  (I did make important NPCs on the spot from paper lunch sacks, socks, and a few blank finger puppets and hand puppets, sewn from old T-shirts and stuff and then modified with Sharpies.)  The most important effect was that the players could, instead of saying "Oh, nasty nutcracker! I shall stuff your mouth with flowers so you can't hurt anyone any more!" or whatever, they could say "Abracadabra!", and have their puppet gesture magically at the mouth of my NPC.  They could then make it known via eye contact that they were planning on using their "This puppet can make flowers appear magically wherever she points" ability; upon realizing that, I could more naturally be the one to say "And <i>poof!</i>, a bouquet of bright red roses appeared in the nutcracker's mouth!"                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201111/#Comment_201111" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T10:42:24+00:00" title="April  7, 2009 10:42AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, that's exactly where my brain went when I drew the IAWA connection.

Most of play occurs in "normal roleplay mode" only the GM-esque bits like "scene framing" or "now this horrible things happens to you" are unique to the Chronicler.  Often the player winds up just doing those things in "normal roleplay voice" too.  But when they remember to do it in "The Voice" it can be very powerful.  The quote above was from actual play (modified to make a better in text example) and was pretty memorable.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, the ritual phrases NEVER get forgotten.  Slamming your hand on the table and loudly proclaiming "that's not how it happened!" or meekly submitting with "as you will..." after losing a Challenge is too much fun to get overlooked.  The other players will sit and stare at you expectantly until you utter the right phrase.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe combination really makes the play experience feel special and unique, much the way the First Person Present Tense requirement for Puppetland does or the ritual phrases in Polaris.  There's no mistaking what game you're playing, when the very language you use to play it is different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like that.  More so than just different dice or fancy character sheets it really puts a stamp on play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201265/#Comment_201265" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-08T10:34:00+00:00" title="April  8, 2009 10:34AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting topic. <br><br>I worked on a number of story-telling games over the last two years: like roleplaying games, except no one plays a role.

If I described the situation in past tense and turn to the player to say, "What did you do then?"
