And by and large I agree with him.  Yes, the technical writing skills of the RPG design community can always use improvement.  But I also wonder how much improvement we need to be as a readership.<br/><br/>One of the most lambasted texts in indie-publishing is Sorcerer.  God knows, I'm one of its harshest critics and so is Ralph.  But the really frustrating thing about Sorcerer as a text is that every clarifying thing Ron has ever said about "how to play the game" is actually in there somewhere.  It really it is.  It's usually stated exactly once and it's not often expanded upon but it is in there somewhere.<br/><br/>So why doesn't anyone ever see it?  Because we bring a shit-ton of expectations from other RPG texts.  That doesn't happen with say boardgames.  We read every set of board game instructions with fresh eyes.  We don't say things like, "Oh it has cards, so we must be taking tricks."  We do, do that in RPGs.<br/><br/>I was just re-reading Sorcerer for the like the 20th time and near the beginning there's this section called "The Heart of The Game" and under it is a description of what makes a good Sorcerer character.  And.  Holy Crap!  Like, the whole fucking game is right there.  Every one of those questions is KEY to making a Sorcerer character work.<br/><br/>So why haven't I ever noticed the importance of those questions before?  Because in a lot of OTHER RPG texts those "questions about your character" are just 'fluff'.  They're ways to get some ideas going and any real content in them will not likely make it into actual play.  It's just a way to give stat and skill choices some context.  The questions in Sorcerer, on the surface, look exactly the same textually but here they really matter.  A Sorcerer character just isn't complete if it doesn't address every single one of those issues.  But the gamer-text trained eye just goes, "yeah, yeah, character questions...."<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age... suffers from the same problem.  It's procedurally very clear step by step.  But people get confused because they bring in assumptions from their experiences with Dogs in the Vineyard or Primetime Adventures.  If you do what the book says and ONLY what the book says, you'll be fine.<br/><br/>I think the flaws in the technical writing quality of RPG community reflects the flaws in its readership.  As long as we continue to import out assumptions about "how RPGs work" or even "how Story Games work" or "how indie games work" from text-to-text then there is no incentive on the writers to fill the gaps because we will (sometimes errantly) fill in the gaps for them.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196571/#Comment_196571" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-11T12:51:40+00:00" title="March 11, 2009 12:51PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely know what you mean, but I don't think there's going to be a solution, so to speak.

Lots of flaws in how we read texts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think part of the solution is controlling how the audience reads the text.  That's a whole other related topic to the content of what the text is.  We can control how a text is read by how it is laid out.  What's highlighted, what's called out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagazines are especially good at this.  One can detect the political bias in a Times magazine article by looking at what pull quotes the editor chose to feature.  The article may read fairly unbiased...but those pull quotes, choices of picture, and captions can totally spin things one way or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nMouse Guard is a good recent example of a book that uses layout to direct the reader in how to read the text.  I'm not enough of a layout guru to identify exactly what was done...but I know as a reader I could definitely tell I was being carefully guided from point to point to point.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo use Board Games (again) as an example of this...the use of illustrated examples and side bars in a set of board game rules blows away anything I've ever seen in an RPG game text.  Current text books also do a good job of graphically laying a large volume of information out in easily digestible chunks.  Text books also often follow the old speaking guideline of "tell them what your going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them"; with introductory "here's what you're going to learn in this chapter" text closed out with a quiz or "what you know" section at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of people here in the indie community who have mad skillz at making a book LOOK good.  What are some good indie examples of layouts that help guide the reader through the text.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven using the exact same text, I think a more technically oriented layout probably would have helped the "I-get-it-ability" of both Sorcerer and IaWA.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196578/#Comment_196578" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-11T14:23:42+00:00" title="March 11, 2009  2:23PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think more or less suscribe to the idea that the consumer more or less cannot do it wrong.

Whenever you present something to an audience they will always have some built in bias that leads them to make assumptions about what you say. When you write something you have to account for 1) how much you are challenging your audience, and 2) their expectations about how much effort they have to invest to get it. From what I've read of Ron's comments, I think it's pretty clear he assumed a small audience with an academic level commitment to working with a text. That proved to be a mismatch with the audience that actually responded.<br/><br/>I certainly agree that rpg readers could be more open to working to understand the actual text of any rpg -- but I also note that this is a hobby and supposed to be fun. How hard do you want your players to work before they get to the fun part?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196662/#Comment_196662" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T11:14:49+00:00" title="March 12, 2009 11:14AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting.  It's true that readers of RPGs carry assumptions from game to game, and that probably hinders understanding in some cases.  However, I think the reason this happens is because RPG <i>writers</i> frequently leave things ambiguous or unsaid and this has essentially created a <i>requirement</i> that readers make assumptions to fill in the gaps.  Board game rules generally don't leave things as ambiguous.  Though, saying board game players make NO assumptions is probably over-stating things.  For example, if the game uses special cards that the players hold and use, I generally assume there is probably a hand limit.  If the game rules have nothing to say at all about hand limits, I'll probably go ask some question on a forum or something to confirm that there actually isn't one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HerpestesFantasticus" title="HerpestesFantasticus"><img alt="HerpestesFantasticus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HerpestesFantasticus">HerpestesFantasticus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196679/#Comment_196679" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T13:14:45+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  1:14PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2009 1:15PM by HerpestesFantasticus.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really have anything to say about rpg book layout, I haven't yet written any rpgs. I have to say, though, that I have seen boardgame players also bring their assumptions to the rules. In Carcassonne, another player once thought you could just keep putting meeples in an already claimed area, that you could get into a bidding war on a particular area of land. This is something the rules explicitly say you cannot do. Also, I know someone, who in playing Monsterpocalypse, assumed there were line of sight restrictions. The Monsterpocalypse rulebook explicitly says, "There is no line of sight." because it knows boardgame players will assume that there is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Mouse Guard's printing half the rules on the Character Sheet is a big help.

Similarly I was playing Viktory a game where build your map out of hex tiles like in Settlers of Cataan and the designer made sure to point out that in Viktory you occupy the actual hex not the vertices between the hexes...because he knew that people would assume you use the vertices like in Cataan.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost RPGs unfortunately fail to answer those sorts of questions when it comes to procedural issues...like...after seeing what difficulty the GM is assigning to the roll, can you change your mind and decide not to make the roll after all?  Failing to answer that question in a boardgame would be utterly unacceptable.  I continue to be shocked by how willing RPGers are to not only accept such failures in RPG texts...but celebrate them as a good thing...and defend them against criticism...ridiculous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196689/#Comment_196689" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T13:43:58+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  1:43PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>Though, saying board game players make NO assumptions is probably over-stating things.

I've experienced mechanics like the use of symbols instead of colors to mark players (Tigris &amp; Euphrates), drawing a card at the <i>end</i> of your turn (Lost Cities, Blue Moon, and others), soft hand limits (the Catan series), multiple currencies (Tower of Babel), and others. So, I find that I <i>don't</i> make as many assumptions about games as I used to.<br><br>Seth Ben-Ezra<br>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196691/#Comment_196691" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T13:53:19+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  1:53PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't actually agree with this.

First, faults in presentation cause people to miss things, which they then fill in from what they know of other RPGs.  Second, the presence of large amounts of "fluff text" in many mainstream RPGs encourages readers to not read completely.  This becomes habit, and is carried over into non-mainstream RPGs, which causes more things to be missed.<br/><br/>A third factor, which I think was alluded to earlier in this thread, is that many people haven't actually read the games they play.  They are instead taught to play by someone, who was taught by someone else, and so on.  Thus, one person's misunderstandings and/or "house rules" become what other people believe are the standard rules.<br/><br/>None of this is particular to RPGs -- it happens with other kinds of texts as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196719/#Comment_196719" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T17:09:09+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  5:09PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, I disagree with the idea that the reason we don't understand Sorcerer/IAWA is because we bring expectations from other texts.

Only three of the players own the game rules. Despite the relatively low price tag ($10), and despite the availability of one photocopied and bound rulebook specifically created as a "loaner", the other players have not read the game rules, and probably will not do so in the near future.<br/><br/>If this were a class or fiction workshop or book club, or any other social group that revolved around a particular text, failure to have READ the text would be a fairly serious issue. But this is pretty normal in gaming circles. <br/><br/>So it's not just some sort of misplaced indie-elitism to say that the player/reader can sometimes be at fault, rather than the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
