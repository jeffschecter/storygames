Serious and contemplative, and really getting you to think about who and what your character is and stands for, rather than going out with both guns blazing. No major nitpicks (aside from a spell-checker standpoint), but I can't really tell how well it'd play until I play it...<br/>If anything, this might be good mechanics for running a hack of Vampire or Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>And, at your urging, I am continuing with my stormtrooper game.

It looks absolutely brutal, and the rules make it look like you'll be paying a hell of a lot of prices. And it's totally wicked that there's an incentive to cross off "my kids" to save your own ass. I mean that 'wicked' in every sense of the word, there.<br/><br/>The resolution itself still seems a bit. . . awkward? But I haven't tried it out, it might be one of those things that's more intuitive when you're actually moving dice around. I will admit that I got a *lot* more out of it after reading the description and then the example, rather than just the example that you posted earlier. <br/><br/>Also, I like the Lady Blackbird-esque "ready to go" package. It lets you get down to business, which is nice. <br/><br/>Finally, I was a tiny bit unclear on the 'goals'. Are all of the goal cards available to pursue if you want to, for everybody?

Looking through the eyes of the Imperial troops as people, rather than as the cannon-fodder they were inthe movies. Maybe not all of them were as fanatically loyal as the movies would portray. Just like many WWII movies always seem to portray every single Nazi as an evil baby-killer, in reality we know that some were really blinded to the truth by their propaganda, and others didn't have much choice but to obey.<br/>True, it's not exacly easy to stomach the idea of playing either a Nazi or an Imperial, but that's kind of what makes it an interesting challenge, particularly if you want to then bring out more human aspects of the character. Think of it as Star Wars as a Film Noir, or a gritty arthouse film.<br/>Still, it's not everybody's cup of tea. Of course, I'm an Imperial, so it's more up my alley, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272036/#Comment_272036" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T11:45:29+00:00" title="May 19, 2010 11:45AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>In 1977, the Empire is called "evil" three lines into the roller caption, and the next 9 years and 3 movies were spent showing us exactly how undeniably correct that evaluation was.

My jumping-off point for the fiction of my game is absolutely "These films are propaganda. The revolution was not good vs. evil." And I get that some people won't care to play in that world. No worries.<br/><br/>For what it is worth, I also consider our tales of the American Revolution to be pure propaganda, but it doesn't stop me from having heroic regard for George Washington or James Madison or Caesar Rodney.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272037/#Comment_272037" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T11:56:00+00:00" title="May 19, 2010 11:56AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>You really just have to see it as a retelling from the other side of the battlefield.</blockquote>\n<i>All Quiet on The Western Front </i>, Star Wars edition? <br/><br/>I hope everyone's familiar with LucasArt's 1994 <i>Star Wars: TIE Fighter</i>.

Anyone can earn progress toward any goal at any time. Now, some characters logically have more intense interest in some goals than others. And as you gleaned from the rules, pursuing goals can be punishing. So part of the game is seeing what happens when players are pulling together to help each other, and then someone starts to "hit the wall" in the prices he's willing to pay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272046/#Comment_272046" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T12:14:50+00:00" title="May 19, 2010 12:14PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Hey, this looks very interesting!<br/><br/>Has it been playtested at all?<br/><br/>I agree with JDCorley about it being a really "harsh" re-envisioning of the Star Wars story.

I hope to playtest it again tonight.<br/><br/>With 4 players, it took us 2 hours on my one playtest.

In practice, it went very smoothly after a few runs.<br/><br/>Regarding the fiction, I had thought I would need to hammer, hammer, hammer in order to get players to adopt an anti-Republic POV to play their characters.

This would also have the nice effect of making the decision to, say, use your six to cancel out one of the GM's an interesting tactical choice rather than merely a lucky break on your dice. So if I roll six dice and get 6, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1 and the GM rolls four dice for 6, 4, 2, 2 and I group (6), (4, 2), (3, 3) then I get 3 progress and cancel out the GM's 2 (since he doesn't have a 1), which means that the GM could group (6), (4, 2) and extract two concessions from me. But if I group (4, 3, 3) and use the other dice for caution, I cancel out both of the GM's 2s as well as the 6, leaving only a 4 which means no concessions to the bad guys plus 1 big progress for me. Something like that would make the whole process seem more coherent or organic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272048/#Comment_272048" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T12:26:48+00:00" title="May 19, 2010 12:26PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.<br/><br/>Some more comments:<br/><br/>1. Why did you choose not to put in any kind after-the-roll choice for the players? Like, say, being able to give up on a Goal or something like that in exchange for not paying a Price. Because sometimes it seems like you could get totally shafted by a GM's roll, and not have any "way out". Is that part of what you're going for?<br/><br/>I'm thinking of mechanics like Giving in Dogs in the Vineyard, where you can Give on the conflict in exchange for avoiding Fallout you can't afford to take. <br/><br/>2. Why do characters who escape the planet not need to pay a Price? I think it would be cool to have someone try to escape the planet... only to die on their trip out of the system.<br/><br/>3. How often in play does it feel weird to retroactively narrate a Price into the fiction? I'd be worried about this. Because the Prices are not linked to what you're doing or what Goal you're striving for. For instance, say you get into a fight, and choose to check off "my kids", who aren't present... what now? Do we narrate in a whole new set of circumstances to explain that? That seems to be the case in your example of play. I could see this becoming a problem particularly as the choices for Prices begin to get narrowed down, later in the game.<br/><br/>I do like how all the mechanics reinforce the situation in play, and act to lead to wrapping it up, through escalation and worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272049/#Comment_272049" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T12:27:46+00:00" title="May 19, 2010 12:27PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill,<br/><br/>I was thinking along the same lines!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272059/#Comment_272059" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T12:49:05+00:00" title="May 19, 2010 12:49PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite>Jason, that's absolutely true, and a fair assessment. My jumping-off point for the fiction of my game is absolutely "These films are propaganda. The revolution was not good vs. evil." And I get that some people won't care to play in that world. No worries.<br/><br/>For what it is worth, I also consider our tales of the American Revolution to be pure propaganda, but it doesn't stop me from having heroic regard for George Washington or James Madison or Caesar Rodney.</blockquote>\nA historical situation is a bit different - I'm far more open to having my real life historical understanding and emotional investment called into question because there's always more to "discover", whereas an artistic one is something where, when the final "The End" comes up, I then solidify my feelings about it in that moment, when I reflect on the work as a whole.  In other words, I wasn't told by a galactic historian that the Death Star destroyed Alderaan for no reason, I <i>saw it happen myself</i>.

That's good stuff, and is hereby yoinked for the next revision. Thanks!<br/><br/>#1: Yes, part of what I was going for was the sense that once you've committed yourself to a subversive act, you are going to pay the price for your uppitiness. Shifting some Caution over is a way of protecting yourself some, but there ain't no free lunch.<br/><br/>#2: Escaping the planet is intended to be a "panic button" move, desperation salvage of things gone terribly wrong. So I didn't want to pile on. Your scenario has got some punch, but I think it would too often be the case. Maybe reduced price....<br/><br/>#3: Retcon of the scene as described is not intended as part of the Price narration. In your case "my kids" case, a savvy player might have put the kids into the scene before rolling, in order to be able to use them as a shield ("wicked" was the term Jeff used.) OR, you could describe running home from the fight, barely shaking the peacekeepers. And when you arrive home...smoking ruins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272085/#Comment_272085" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T13:42:52+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  1:42PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>One theme I see running through this that I think could use some expansion is that I get the idea that this version of the New Republic is very Jedi-centric.

I definitely like the idea of questioning the whole Jedi thing. I'm doing some of it, but as you point out, it's not as central to the core conflict. Hmmmm. Thanks for the thoughtful input, Jason.
