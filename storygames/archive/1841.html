                    In the thread on where this forum is going, Jason Morningstar wrote:<br/><br/><code>Here's something I notice and dislike - people shilling their own stuff. Not in Directed Promotion threads, where it is fine, but in threads where people ask for advice. "The answer to your query is, in all cases, my game."</code><br/><br/>That's something I've been thinking about recently, and I'd actually like to talk about it.  Here's the deal.<br/><br/>Several of us just finished designing a game.  It's a process where you think about it all day long, rewrite it every day, and basically immerse yourself in it.  That makes it take over a certain part of your brain.  So when I see a discussion, more often than not, my mind automatically turns to how that relates to my design.  Not because I want to market it by talking about it all the time, but because that's just the thing that's been on my mind all this time.<br/><br/>I'm aware that I did this with one of John Kim's threads recently, not purposely to talk about my game, but just because I felt I could share some insight based on the design I'd just done.  But afterward I did feel weird, like it could be perceived to be "shilling" after all, and that's not what I want.<br/><br/>So my questions then are:  Is this always annoying, or does it actually help people when you have that as a concrete example that the designer really knows well?  Is there a difference between saying "This is how that relates to my game" and "You should buy my game because it does exactly that?"  Anything else that relates to this topic you'd like to get off your chest? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>- Christian                </div>

                            Personally, I think it would be useful in those cases where an immediate example from your own work leaps out to take a breath, look around, and find a comparable example from another game.  Particularly a game that deserves love.  Any love your own work gets is a wonderful gift, so ... golden rule.  You make your point, you share some goodness, you don't look like a pimp.  I'm not saying I'm the poster child for this but it would be nice.                        </div>

                            Enh.  I admit, once I accepted that I'd be taking people's money for a game (suckers!) I became much more ok with saying "Y'know what's awesome? My game."  I like to presume that anyone who has written a game did so to do things they thought were cool, and if those things come up in conversation, I would far rather a game designer speak up and say "Yeah, we thought about that when designing our game, and we did X, and it's worked out for us in Y fashion" than have the designer (who hopefully has useful things to say) remain silent for fear of appearing to be a shill.<br/><br/>That said, I also expect a game designer to be keenly aware of what their game _doesn't_ do well.  You can do a lot of different things with a lot of different games, but if you can't step up and say "No, you don't want my game for that" (and ideally "But this other game might work") then yes, you're shilling.  If you don't know what your game can't do, it's probably worth figuring out, because if you really and truly feel your game is the best choice every time an issue comes up, then you really, really owe yourself a long, hard look.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - That said, I usually see the worst of this behavior from fans rather than the designers themselves.                        </div>

                            What Jason said.  I make a point of not talking about my own games unless specifically asked or someone else brings them up first.  Also, if I'm like "Game X does this and it rocks!" then maybe the author of Game X will be like "Jonathan's game totally does that too!"                        </div>

                            To elaborate.<br/><br/>Let us suppose the topic is puppies.<br/><br/>Our theoretical game designer cared enough about puppies that hae sat down to make the best damn puppy based game he could imagine.  He read up on puppies, tried puppy variants, and just generally did a lot of puppy related work.  In our field, we probably can't get away with calling anyoen an expert, but it's safe to say, this guy has gotten pretty deep into the puppy issue.<br/><br/>So when a thread comes up about puppies in gaming, why in the would would I _want_ him to be silent? <br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I've dropped Verge into conversations a couple times when I thought it was appropriate. I don't think I'm just shilling the game. I really thought my game was the answer for the particular problems the poster was postulating. (I just used up my quota of P words for the day. Damn.)<br/><br/>And since I think the answer was true, why wouldn't I suggest it? It feels weird doing it when it's my own work, but barely anyone else has <i>heard</i> of Verge, so I doubt anyone else will suggest it. <br/><br/>And even if I were shilling like a used car salesman, it's just annoying. No real harm done. Skim to the next post.                        </div>

                            Rob, you can totally say "Here's a whole bunch of stuff I've learned about puppies" without pimping your 5-volume puppy-pedia, which may not be what people want at all.  Maybe they just want some basic advice on puppies.  Being helpful is one thing.  Gratuitous self-promotion is another.  And people will have to make their own judgment calls on the dividing line between them.                        </div>

                            It's one thing if the puppy-, err, -lover simply brings his puppy knowledge to the topic. (I have no qualms about discussing samurai stuff, when it comes up.) Sometimes, though, it <i>feels</i> like people are stretching the topic to include references to their own game.<br/><br/>Alot of it is really just the tone people use. Something that adds to this feeling is when people only reference their game. I don't think it's so bad when someone mentions 3 or 4 games, and their's is one of them. MJ Young use to be really good over at the Forge with mentioning (pimping?) his game Multiverser in ways that didn't sound like he was trying to sell it. He would often be like, "In Multiverser I did it this way, in games X &amp; Y they did it this way, and in game Z they did it that way..."<br/><br/>[edit] <i>Cross-posted with Jonathon</i> [/edit]                        </div>

                            Sure, but if I'd written the puppy rpg, and I don't mention it in a puppy related gaming discussion, that seems pretty disingenuous on my part.<br/><br/>Seriously, I'm totally down with suggesting that people not look at every topic as an opportunity to pimp their game.

                            Oh my god, yes.  Having just finished off my own game, it was like the thing was taking over my brain and literally every thread that was happening seemed to relate directly to my game.  I really had to pry myself off of my keyboard sometimes, and often I wasn't successful.  On the other hand, though, I agree with Rob: when a thread really is about a topic that your game covers well, that's the time to stand up and represent.  The key is just to do it in a way that isn't overbearing and obnoxious (which can be a little difficult).                        </div>

                            Nobody's saying you shouldn't talk about your own games.  What Jason's talking about (and, correct me if I'm wrong) is when people bring up their games at <i>inappropriate times</i>.  If you mention your game when it's really and truly pertinent to the conversation, AND you have something to say about the topic, you won't come off as a shill.  At least, you won't to me.  That's because you're mentioning your game in service to the conversation at hand.  It happens a lot in design or theory threads.<br/><br/>Another thing to consider is overall community participation.  If 9/10ths of your posts include the phrase "my game" then you likely come off as a shill.  Whereas if you frequently have things to say that are interesting and on-topic that don't involve your game, people will know there's more to you than selling your game, and will be more inclined to take posts that <i>are</i> about it in the correct spirit.<br/><br/>Then again, this may be just the way I perceive things.  I imagine other people are different...                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>MJ Young use to be really good over at the Forge with mentioning (pimping?) his game Multiverser in ways that didn't sound like he was trying to sell it.

MJ always does this with Legends of Alyria too.                        </div>

                            Actually it's funny, because even MJ felt at times like he was going over the line. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, Jamey, we do have a difference of opinion in this thread. There's one camp saying, "Talk about it to your heart's content, as long as it's really pertinent." And we have another saying, "Don't talk about it, talk about other games instead." These are pretty incompatible notions.<br/>
<br/>
I think I side with the "talk about it" people, with the caveat that you should also share the love. But that's just me.<br/>

                            Of course you should talk about your own designs and discoveries and thoughts, because those things are interesting and important.  You can do that without posturing or jockeying for status or marketing to your peers.  You can do that while being gracious and kind-hearted.                        </div>

<p>So, in my case, I'm primarily a consumer, and that means that I see other people talking about other peoples' games a lot more often than I see Shreyas talking about Shreyas's games or anyone else's.</p>
<p>I really like to see designers talk about their own games, or at the very least playtesters, because I really don't trust other folks to understand the game well and be able to explicate it in its full flexibility and depth. That's the designer's special knowledge, and I suspect that not a few of us know about cool things that they can do with their games and didn't put into their books explicitly.</p>
<p>That stuff is great. I hunger for it.</p>
<p>But there's a limit... if you the designer are the only person at all talking about your game, maybe that's not so good. If you find yourself never talking about anybody else's games, maybe that's not so good.</p>
<p>And, of course, you can get real jewels out of the things that naive players, or very design-minded ones, derive from games that aren't of their own design, and this is stuff that's really important to talk about.</p>
<p>All that it takes is a bit of sensitivity and attention, carefully applied.</p>

<br/>
Huh. I don't know, man. I'm inclined to say that the buying/monetary aspect isn't really part of it. I mean, isn't it still shilling (or at least annoying) if your game is free? I'm in the position where the only game I've "published" is a free PDF. I know I've mentioned it in a few threads, but only where it seemed appropriate to the discussion at hand.<br/>
<br/>
If I were all like, "Yeah, my game's perfect for playing a game about puppies. Or cyborg puppies. Or drug-enhanced cyborg puppies fighting magic-using dinosaurs. You should totally download it right now and try it out, because it's the best damn game EVAR!!!'," then I'm probably shilling <b>more than</b> the guy pointing out that his game specifically addresses the topic at hand, and that you should buy it if that's your thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's more a matter of tone than anything else. I don't really think anything needs to be <b>done</b> about it, because I just self-filter. If it's seems like a shameless plug, my respect for the poster goes down a bit, and I skip over it. If it interests me, and/or it's related to the topic, I might be more inclined to check it out.                        </div>

                            I've got no problem with people shilling their games per se. I think it's good. What I do have a problem with is shilling games <i>at the expense of helping out the guy who started the thread</i>.<br><br>So, this is totally cool with me...
<blockquote>First Post: I'm thinking of writing a game about puppies.<br>Second Post: Cool! I wrote a game about puppies! Take a look!</br></blockquote>
And so's this...
<blockquote>First Post: I'm thinking of buying a game for my sister. She likes animals.<br>Second Post: Take a look at my game about puppies!</br></blockquote>
And this...
<blockquote>First Post: I'm having trouble with conflict resolution between non-humans.<br>Second Post: Yeah, I had that problem with Puppy Game. This is what I did...</br></blockquote>
But this is borderline...
<blockquote>First Post: Can you recommend me some GM-less games?<br>Second Post: My game about puppies doesn't have a GM!</br></blockquote>
And this is right out...

                            That's a lot of great input.  I guess it does come down to moderation and self-awareness, in that we as designers should try to keep in mind that there might be other, better examples than our own designs.  That said, it's not easy to shift your perspective when you're so immersed in one thing, and I figured that JBR totally knew what I meant, seeing how much you've been working on FLFS recently.<br/><br/>I must agree with Mike in that (sorry MJ) I remember getting to a point where I instinctively skipped all of MJ's posts because all that I'd read felt like Multiverser ads.  I really don't want to fall into that same trap.  So I'll agree with Graham on the lines here and try to stick to that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>
