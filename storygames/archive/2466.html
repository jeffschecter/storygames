                    I currently need to design an awesome alternate history one-shot to run at Go Play Northwest. Despite the fact that I've got a file full of alternate history ideas, I kind of want to mix it up a bit and also find out what other people think is interested. So I propose this: let me know what alternate/awesome-ized/lasersharked peice of history you'd like to see as the kernel of a one-shot. I'll pick one that sparks my enthusiasm, write the adventure, run it at Go Play NW, and send you a copy.<br/><br/>Here are some more guidelines:<br/>What I need for an entry:
<ul><li>An obscure historical figure you think is awesome and/or</li>
<li>A real historical person or event and idea of how to lasershark it and/or</li>
<li>A real historical person or event and an idea of how to aweseom-o-fy it and/or</li>
<li>A wild macguffing dropped into a historical setting</li></ul>
The setting for Mathematica is rennaisance Europe, but I'm willing to consider ideas in other settings and times (I can just use TSOY for them if they're not appropriate for Mathematica).<br/><br/>You don't need to be intimate with Mathematica, but here's the quick pitch if you're interested:<br/><br/><i>Mathematica is a game about the war of ideas set in renaissance Europe. But in this renaissance Europe, ideas are made starkly incarnate. This is a world where we might see Michelangelo building giant clockwork war machines, Machiavelli training eldritch doppelganger assassins, or Sir Francis Drake on a daring journey to Avalon to consult with Merlin. It's also a world about epic conflict: the Old Church against the upstart reformers, city states struggling for independence against central powers, threats of foreign invasion, the light of science against the dark of superstition (or vice versa).</i> </div>

                            Hi Tony,<br/><br/>I found the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS-GB" rel="nofollow">SS-GB</a> by Len Deighton to be fascinating.  It deals with a Scotland Yard investigator collaborating with a sympathetic German counterpart in 1941 Nazi-occupied Britain.  There are still pockets of resistance in the hinterlands, but in London the battle is long since over even if the scars can still be seen.<br/><br/>I always thought it would be a great setting for a game.                        </div>

His memoirs are great and he met some really interesting people like Voltaire, Ben Franklin and Catherine the Great.<br/><br/>He did some good writing as well, including a little-known early piece of science fiction called 'L'icosameron' about a brother and sister who spent 81 years inside of the Earth amongst strange creatures called Megamigres.                        </div>

                            Tony: in 1598, William Shakespeare's theatre company had no theatre to perform in.<br/><br/>So, that winter, they went to the theatre they used to perform in (called The Theatre) and took all the wood. They were armed to the teeth. They took the wood to Southwark, on the South Bank of the Thames, and built a new theatre, The Globe. <br/><br/>That's my favourite story and it hardly needs awesomifying. Oh, OK, you could have Shakespeare leading an army of swordsmen against the Globe defenders, swashbuckling on the frozen ice of the Thames.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<p>What we know, historically: Lorenzo DeMedici has the world's largest information network, used to deal information between his silver mines in Germany and the Offices in Firenze. It takes mere days to get precise and accurate information because of this carefully built network, including trusted messengers, well-guarded wayhouses with fresh horses, and coded messages.</p>
<p>What we don't know: This is no mere financial scheme. Lorenzo, in fact, has a network that spans Europe entire and will tell anyone whatever it is they need to know for a price. This is the true fortune of the Medici; the silver in their mines is quicker than many have thought.</p>
<p>In fact, Lorenzo himself is Hermes Trismegistus, an incarnate of Hermes, Mercury , and Tehuti. He's making his power play now; this will be the age of information and commerce. He laid the seeds thousands of years ago when he taught the PhÅ“necians to write down their records. Ares has ruled the day, but Hermes is making his move now. Medicine, magic, words, and money will rule this age. Silver, not iron, will shake the roots of the human world in Hermes' age.</p>

                            How about something in Norman Sicily with one of the seemingly more enlightened rulers (for example William II "the Good") bringing about a lasting reconciliation between Christians and Muslims?  Norman Sicily, from what I understand, did have a peacable mixture of the two cultures and religions for some time, who is to say what could have happened if that had spread? (Need to look up references to be sure about this, thinking from me aged memory right now...)<br/>
<br/>
Some other characters in this period: Innocent III and Frederick II (Holy Roman Emperor)... anyway, a pivitol point in history of the church and some say Western society in general.... (for general reference, "Europe in the High Middle Ages" by William Chester Jordan, check out page 195, et. al.)                        </div>

                            I'm stealing Joshua's format.<br/><br/>What we know: A bit late for Mathematica perhaps, but Hernando Cortes was the conquistador who started the conquest of Mexico. He was a mayor of a town, beat up Mexico, fought the governor of Cuba and won. Won a crappy title when he argued that his conquest of Mexico wasn't mutiny but a great military for Spain.<br/><br/>What we don't know: Cortes had actually already made a good number of deals with the high priests of the Aztec civilization. In return for their backstabbing, Cortes would provide endless sacrifices of European peasants imported under the guise of settlement.<br/><br/>In fact, Acolmiztli, the Aztec god of the ninth level of underworld, promised Cortes easy victory if Cortes promised to come to Acolmiztli's underworld after his death. In addition, he made the promise that if Cortes could deliver 100,000 of God's chosen people to sacrifice to Acolmiztli's name, he would show Cortes to the Lost City of Gold. Cortes needed the gold to clear his name of mutiny and return home to Spain.                        </div>
