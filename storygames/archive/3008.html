Gain 1 XP every time your character successfully completes a Crafting project. Gain 3 XP every time your character completes a Crafting project that is met with great appreciation from many. Buyoff: Destroy one of your creations.<br/><br/><b>Key of (Metaphorical) Impotence</b><br/>You ought to be able to do something just fine, but for some reason you can't. This difficulty could be sexual, social, or physical; the source of the problem may be self-doubt, overconfidence, or an evil curse. In any event the player should select a single skill when choosing this key, and may apply a penalty die to that skill at any time to reflect these mysterious difficilities. When the penalty die applies to a routine situation, gain 1 XP. When the penalty die applies to an important situation, gain 2 XP. When the penalty die applies to an urgent, life-or-death, out-of-control-story-madness situation, gain 5 XP. Buyoff: Overcome the source of this anxiety.<br/><br/>At the end of the last session, she had the opportunity to (a) destroy one of her creations (an automaton that had run amok) and thereby (b) get rid of Key of the Craftsman.  She wasn't very happy this key (since it created, in her words, a "mage scroll-scribing economy" where the character could just sit in a locked room and make cuckoo clocks to churn xp, and didn't seem to 'fit' with the TSoY-mojo of 'interacting with other characters is where it's AT), so she dumped it.<br/><br/>Now, the plan is to replace that Key with a new one that is much less about 'creating new stuff all the time' and much MORE about 'making the stuff that I create more fun for everyone playing.'  In essense, some kind of Key, that functions in the same philosophical vein as this Secret:<br/><br/><b>Secret of the Heart of the Machine</b><br/>Your character has more oil in his veins than blood. For the purposes of refreshing ability pools, your character may count machines as characters, whether they are sentient or not. In other words, spending a long night tinkering with the engine of an airship is the same for you as drinking with a buddy.<br/><br/>In short, a key that rewards the player for (re)incorporating her creations into scenes with other characters.  Or something.<br/><br/>Problem: I'm a bit stumped; I call upon the power of the Internets to help me put together a good key for this.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>(cross-posted to the Forge)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68515/#Comment_68515" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T12:32:48+00:00" title="May 11, 2007 12:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2007 1:02PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Key of the Ethical Machinist</b><br/><br/>Your character makes machines that solve problems and ease suffering.

Machines are just tools, of course, but for whatever reason -- fate, an evil curse, or just plain bad luck -- your character's tools always seem to end up being used for evil.

Gain 2 XP whenever your character struggles to keep his/her creations from falling into the wrong hands. Gain 5 XP whenever a seemingly innocent or actively good device of your character's invention is subverted to an evil cause. Buyoff: stop making things.<br/><br/>I'd say the buyoff needs some work, depending on the tone of the campaign. The PC for which I originally developed this concept had stopped making useful objects -- instead he invented increasingly elaborate Goldberg-esque devices that did totally useless things (like turning Coke into Pepsi). But of course they always turned out to be useful after all (the innocuous spife/spoon-knife that turned out to be the perfect size and shape to unjam the Army's assault rifles, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68614/#Comment_68614" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T17:49:34+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  5:49PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Key of the Jealous Artist<br/>Your character is not just a craftsman, trying to make it through the day -- his/her creations are works of art, deserving of public acclamation and praise.

The ethical/blind keys focus on what effects "the stuff she's made" has in terms of other characters and the setting/situation at large. Similarly, the Jealous Artist key only gives XP when the character's creations are made to interact with society or other characters. <br/><br/>Maybe you could kind of twist Judd's key around and turn it into a Key about how the character's clockworks are spontaneously developing intelligence? (Or maybe that's what Judd intended?)
