I am a boardgamer who stumbled across Fiasco through a boardgame podcast and was immediately taken with the game rules.  It took me a few months to even find a group of people to play with (my girlfriend and my sister, and the game went splendidly!).  But in the mean time  and after the Fiasco session I've had a grand time reading RPG rules.  I love to read boardgame rules and I find RPG rules equally interesting, so its pretty exciting cause now there is a whole new world of gamerules to mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile skimming the "workout and read RPG" thread I noticed some folks digging into the wayback machine for their workout texts.  And it made me think that I should ask what y'all think I should check out as a newbie to this field.  What would be worth reading as a primer to this type of gaming.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not necessarily asking for a list of light games that help ease a newbie into the hobbie slowly, though that would be nice.  Nor am I just asking for a list of your favorite RPGs, thought at would great too. I'm interested in a well rounded list of good games that are worth checking out and which would give me a good overview of the hobby.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor what its worth, I went through this exercise of making a "personal canon" of eurogames and ended up with 6 categories with three games each.  Here are the categories:<br/>\n<br/>\nHistorically significant games, <br/>\nModern Classics, <br/>\nCurrent Hotness<br/>\nPersonal Favorites,<br/>\nLight Games of note<br/>\nInteresting Hybrids.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365823/#Comment_365823" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T23:19:58+00:00" title="March  7, 2012 11:19PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2012 11:21PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll skip on roleplaying games in general - the history goes back to the '70s, but as you asked specifically about "story games", let's concentrate on that.<br/><br/>First, <i>Sorcerer</i> is a definitive work. Its impact has been slow in building, but it's easily the most influential single game in this tradition. It's a dense work that is intended for long-time roleplayers; no guarantees that it'll be interesting for an arbitrary reader. It's not a foundational text in the sense that other design would be limited by it; rather, the game and other writings by its designer Ron Edwards formed an unique artistic platform upon which others have expanded and built upon.<br/><br/>Other games with both popular and critical recognition include <i>InSpectres</i>, <i>My Life with Master</i>, <i>Dust Devils</i>, <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, <i>Polaris</i>, <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> and certainly a few other games that don't occur to me right this moment. These form a hard core of Forge design (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com" rel="nofollow">The Forge</a> is a website where the community originates) that is emulated by dozens of other games - each is considered successful, well-designed and influential for a reason, as the games feature both strong gameplay and innovative, new ideas. This is a strongly neophilic community, but the new stuff builds mostly upon this foundation, so the quickest way to get "up to date" is to check out these antecedents from the early part of the '00s.<br/><br/>There are other vectors of influence and more exotic heritages of gaming out there: jeepform, dense traditionalism, old school D&amp;D, Japanese games, traditional freeform and so on. These are usually individual designers with esoteric interests who mostly hang out with the Forgean crowd because they feel that their interests in gaming and design philosophy are well-matched.<br/><br/>I don't particularly feel a need to name-drop recent titles, as you're not looking for recommendations in specific genres or styles. The undergrowth is dense and delightful, there are several dozen of games in this cultural space that I find filled with intricate and deep insights. Finding your own favourites is ultimately an intensely personal task, despite how keenly people will push their own this month's favourites at you. The games range heavily in terms of social footprint from one-off things that resemble boardgames (like Fiasco, say) to projects that are intended to span months or years of weekly practice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365824/#Comment_365824" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T23:20:44+00:00" title="March  7, 2012 11:20PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 12:01AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to have a good answer to this, but it's hard.  My experience started with the least well-defined games, suddenly jumped over to very tightly defined games, and then expanded back out into in-between territory.  So the learning curve I had is absolutely not what I'd recommend; but it's hard for me to suggest a sequence without reference to my own experience.  Plus, there are some games that are great to play, but godawful to read!  That said, here's my best attempt at a sampling of some of the variety that's out there:<br/><br/><b>GMless:</b><br/>Montsegur 1244<br/>A Penny for My Thoughts<br/>Kagematsu<br/>Sign in Stranger<br/><br/><b>Very different GM roles:</b><br/><a href="http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_puppetland.html" rel="nofollow">Puppetland</a><br/>Sorcerer<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>1970s Dungeons &amp; Dragons<br/><br/><b>Group collaboration tools:</b><br/>Primetime Adventures<br/>Universalis<br/><br/><b>Fiction:</b><br/>King Arthur Pendragon<br/>Vampire: the Masquerade<br/><br/><b>Strategy:</b><br/>Burning Empires<br/><br/>Most of these have aspects I don't like, but I'd consider all of these good games, except perhaps for Vampire, which is an amazing <i>book</i>.  Call of Cthulhu is similarly inspiring and problematic, and is much more venerable.  If you want a sampling of RPG history, I'd also recommend Rifts as an exemplar of various trends in the hobby.  You might also find my <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/resolution.html" rel="nofollow">cartoons</a> interesting, as a style of play that's definitely out there but not in many books.  If you're curious about freeform, I've been told that <a href="http://jeepen.org/games/upgrade/" rel="nofollow">The Upgrade</a> is quite good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365832/#Comment_365832" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T23:44:49+00:00" title="March  7, 2012 11:44PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My two favorite games:<br/><br/>Apocalypse World<br/>Fiasco<br/><br/>Other great games I've played:<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>Universalis<br/>Dread<br/><br/>Games that are classics but I haven't played (or played much):<br/><br/>Burning Wheel<br/>Sorcerer<br/>Primetime Adventures<br/><br/>Things I think are interesting, and have been meaning to try:<br/><br/>Inspectres<br/>Remember Tomorrow<br/>Monster of the Week<br/>Diaspora<br/>Spirit of the Century                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365856/#Comment_365856" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T03:33:48+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  3:33AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 3:34AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you are really interested in the evolution of the hobby, a hard look at each edition of D&amp;D is pretty essential. <br/><br/>If you want the same thing through the lens of a single designer's changing sensibility, look at Steve Jackson's games Melee/Wizard, The Fantasy Trip, and GURPS.

Also compels: other people can dictate (well, encourage) how a player character behaves - not just its player ... <i>and the player can be totally cool with that!</i> Also books: the idea that the characters knowing one another beforehand could be a required part of character creation.<br/><br/><b>Houses of the Blooded: </b>The idea that a game can exclude physically possible behaviour on the grounds of genre. Skirmishes don't happen in ven theatre, so you can either duel or fight a war - nothing in between. Also that players can create the world rather than simply interact with it.<br/><br/><b>Mortal Coil:</b> My first exposure to the idea mentioned above in HOTB: that the players can create magic rather than simply interact with it. I think the 'Fact and a but' is a very elegant way of doing player interaction.<br/><br/><b>Archipelago II:</b> The idea of ritual phrases. Originally from Polaris, but I first encountered it in Archipelago II. It actually took the Love in the Time of Sei\u0111 resources to convince me that Archipelago's ritual phrases weren't stupid.<br/><br/><b>Love in the Time of Sei\u0111:</b> When creating flavour, you can give several options to be chosen in play. <br/><br/><b>In a Wicked Age:</b> The power of oracles.<br/><br/><b>Ghost/Echo:</b> Decoupling 'bad things happen' from 'success or failure'. Getting rid of mechanical differentiation between characters and depending on fictional positioning. Getting rid of mechanical differentiation between challenges - so climbing a 10-foot wall is 'as difficult' as climbing a 100-foot wall, provided both challenges matter to the story. The idea that a pared-down, abstract, player-directed story game could be <i>more</i> accessible than <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>.<br/><br/><b>Lady Blackbird and Apocalypse World:</b> Elegant applications of ideas discussed above. And (in Lady Blackbird) the idea of separating compels from aspects and making them their own thing.<br/><br/><b>Fiasco:</b> Extreme (and great!) application of ideas discussed above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365887/#Comment_365887" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T06:33:54+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  6:33AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 6:35AM by Teataine.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I cast as wide a net as I can without being too broad, and try to capture the "essentials" of the hobby, this is what I'd list:<br/>-Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Basic ('81), also a pick of Advanced D&amp;D 2nd Edition, 3rd Edition, 4th Edition<br/>-Chaosium stuff: Runequest and/or Call of Cthulhu and/or Pendragon<br/>-Various Classics: at least two or three out of Shadowrun, Amber Diceless, Over the Edge, Ars Magica, Vampire the Masquerade and/or Mage the Ascension, Paranoia, Prince Valiant RPG, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying (2nd edition), GURPS or HERO, Cyberpunk 2020<br/>-"Forge Boom": at least two or three out of Sorcerer, In Spectres, Universalis, Polaris, Dogs in the Vineyard, My life with master, The Mountain Witch, Primetime Adventures, The Shadow of Yesterday<br/>-"Contemporary" stuff: Apocalypse World (and assorted hacks), Burning Wheel and/or Mouse Guard, at least one of the FATE games (Spirit of the Century, Diaspora, Dresden Files, Starblazer...), at least one Cortex+ game (Smalville, Leverage, Marvel Heroic Roleplaying), Fiasco, Aces &amp; Eights (for an example of "retro" design), one of the Old School Renaissance texts (like Stars Without Number, Adventurer Conqueror King or Lamentations of the Flame Princess)<br/>-Little gems (many of them free): Lady Blackbird, 1001 Nights, Kagematsu, Montsegur 1244, Puppetland, Archipelago II, Ghost/Echo...<br/><br/>Man, that's a lot of games and I still feel bad about leaving out a lot of stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365931/#Comment_365931" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T08:55:28+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  8:55AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want a list that's been vetted somewhat, you can always look at <a href="http://www.rpg-awards.com/archives.shtml" rel="nofollow">the Indie RPG Award winners from the past 10 years</a>, which is always the first list I suggest.

If you find it offensive, use whisper to let me know. No need to clutter the thread.)<br/><br/>If you want to familiarize yourself with the stuff that folks who've been playing since the 80s are familiar with, one of the classic things to look at is Palladium (which is an umbrella of related games). Rifts is the behemoth game in the Palladium set. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is another. Ninjas and Superspies is another. (Yes, lots of ninjas - probably not an accident.)<br/><br/>That being said, don't invest any real time or money on this one. But when you find someone with a collection of old stuff, ask him if he has any old Palladium stuff and flip through it. If you have a few hours, try to make a character. And, of course, try to minmax out the most powerful character you can.<br/><br/>Then put it down and never do anything with it again. At that point, when someone makes a joke regarding Palladium, you'll be able to laugh along.<br/><br/>That being said, if you want to look at really awesome, fun games, feel free to skip this suggestion altogether. The suggestion is mostly there so you can get the occasional joke.

If you can get a copy reasonably, its not a bad read or a bad play through<br/>\nFor me, the next "brakthrough" was 1984 TSR Conan RPG. I received it as a bday gift and played it despite my trepidations. I am so glad I did. This game dispensed with a lot of the tried and true RPG tropes of the time and focused on heroic combat.<br/>\nToon is another turning point for me. The game is pretty arcane by m,odern standards, but it included the key feature of involving player actions (as opposed to character actions) into the actual game mechanics. If you laughed at someone elses joke, you lost a turn.<br/>\nCyberPunk 2020 was another big one, it put the spotlight on the character with cool lifepaths and forced the player and GM to discuss the PC and figure out details, like why is htis megacorp out to get me when I was 21, etc.<br/>\nI did play the heck out of Paladium, mostly because of the TMNT license.<br/>\nThen I discovered the Forge and I learned aobut some great gems:<br/>\nDogs in the Vineyard, to me this game is the perfect marriage of encouraging narration and description along with fun and interesting mechanics<br/>\n...In Spaaace! This is a free RPG and it showed me that Game mechanics can be Win/Win instead of Win/Lose<br/>\nInSpectres, This is the first (and so far only) RPG that involves mysteries that I have enjoyed. Both as a player and a GM.<br/>\nExalted is a game that brought the one-off rules interactions of CCGs to RPGs. It is fun to play, but it can be difficult to keep all the powers rules straight<br/>\nShadow of Yesterday highlights several key innovations:<br/>\n1) Players get some say in what it is they are rolling for and what skill they are using<br/>\n2) Players get a say in what actions they take earn XP and when they earn it<br/>\n3) It said in the text that an inexperienced character can defeat an experiencedone and they deliver on that promise (unlike every other game I have heard make that claim).<br/>\n4) The magic is varied, interesting and not more complicated than the rest of the game.<br/>\nAlex Cherry's Ensemble is still in playtest format, but it generates fun play on the fly pretty well.<br/>\n3:16 combines story, combat and fun mechanics in a way I have not seen before or since<br/>\nZombie Cinema is a great example of a pick up and play RPG. A product I never thought was possible!<br/>\nD&amp;D 4 is revolutionary in the sense that for the first time a 1st level fight takes the same amount of time to finish as a 10th level fight.<br/>\nRemember Tomorrow is one of the few GMless games I enjoy. IT realy rings the players creativity together in a fun simple way.<br/>\nWushu is storygaming done right, everything you say your character does, happens. And the there are rules and they work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ope this list helps<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366098/#Comment_366098" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T15:59:09+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  3:59PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the Gloranthan setting of Runequest - specifically the setting not the mechanics - is special.
