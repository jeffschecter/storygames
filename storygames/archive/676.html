<p>Okay, all of you philosophy degree types out there can <strong>totally</strong> snicker at me.  I know this is such a total layman's distortion of the concepts that it's almost unrecognizable.  I think it's neat anyway.</p>
<p>People don't think about Abductive Reasoning as being a thing on its own, because they can't track the process.  It's mysterious to the point of being miraculous, sometimes.</p>
<p>Like, if I show you a half-completed jigsaw puzzle, and hand you a piece and say "Where does this fit?" I can imagine a step-by-step deductive process by which you'd answer that.  You look at all the possible places it could fit, check your piece against each possibility, and you do it really, really quickly.</p>
<p>But then if I show you a half-completed jigsaw puzzle and a <strong>whole box full of pieces</strong> and say "Find something that fits," my experience is that you will find a piece which fits <em>somewhere</em> much faster than you would have found the right place for the individual piece.  And when I ask you "How did you find that fitting piece" you'll say something like "Oh, I just looked and saw that it would fit."</p>
<p>The brain has this wierd, wacky ability to parse a vast amount of possibilities in parallel and give <em>an answer</em> to a question more quickly than it can parse a more limited number of possibilities one-by-one and give <em>the answer</em> to a question.</p>
<p>So where does this come up in RPGs?  Since I started thinking to look for it I see it all.  the.  time.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Josh:  There's no freakin' way we're getting past the guards on that castle wall.  They're too tough.<br/>
  Betty:  We totally need some entrance they aren't guarding.<br/>
  Josh:  Like a sewer.  If there were a sewer we'd be home free.<br/>
  Betty:  Right!  There has to be a sewer.  It's not like they're storing all their waste products inside the castle walls, right?<br/>
  Josh:  Exactly!  We have to find that sewer!</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I love that moment.  "If there were an X then Y and Z would follow, so let's discover/create X."  That's what I (at least) mean when I talk about abductive reasoning.</p>
<p>Funky, ain't it?</p>

                            It's interesting stuff.
<blockquote>The brain has this wierd, wacky ability to parse a vast amount of possibilities in parallel and give an answer to a question more quickly than it can parse a more limited number of possibilities one-by-one and give the answer to a question.</blockquote>
Yes, it's fascinating. This is a major topic in improvisation, actually.<br/><br/>Keith Johnstone (who wrote Impro) has this theory that the best possible answer to a question is the one that seems obvious to you. The one that just occurs to you, not one you have to think about. Like in your example above: where's an entrance they aren't guarding? The sewer! It's obvious!<br/><br/>Not only that, but the answer that seems obvious to you <i>won't</i> be obvious to everyone else. In fact, your answer will seem brilliantly creative, even though you just said the obvious thing. You just said "sewer", because it seemed obvious, and everyone else goes "Yes! A sewer! That's brilliant!".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I do like this line of discussion, but I can't restrain myself from making a small correction.  Your description of abductive reasoning isn't bad, but that isn't the same as the phenomenon you are describing.  Abductive reasoning is, essentially, deductive reasoning where one of the components is lacking in certitude.  In other words, "All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal" is deductive in most cases but would be abductive if we weren't sure Socrates is a man ("omg--Socarates could be an immortal, soul sucking vampire!").  <br/>
<br/>
Now, what is getting discussed is a touch different.  <br/>
<br/>
Hamsterprophet / Graham--Aristotle has some discussion of this (methinks in the Rhetoric stuff, but I may be wrong)--if you are fairly sure that given A and C, most of your audience will think B, you should only present them with A and C, because the effort they make to fill in the middle term gives them a sense of 'ownership' that makes it more likely they will take it at face value.<br/>
<br/>
Which is why I think it makes sense for a GM to 'steal' a player's rationale for why things are happening--the fact that the player came to it on their own, makes it feel more like the 'real thing' to them.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the question about finding solutions by creating new interim steps--there is some really neat psych stuff that puzzles over how we make these sorts of 'leaps.'  One of the most interesting elements of it to me is the notion of 'experts'--what defines such an individual is not (just) there mastery of the material at hand (in this case, rules of the game), but the ability to make lateral moves (definitely in line with 'parallel' process talk, Tony).  A few ideas as to what happens in a lateral move:<br/>
<br/>
1. The expert draws on a different set of rules and applies them experimentally to the domain they are actually working in--this seems to be related to metaphors and such (this is like this, maybe, also like this, we can do this...)<br/>
<br/>
2. The expert begins to vary the rules internally and sees what happens (ok, so what if A is really B, can I get to C then?  no, well what if it is Z...)<br/>
<br/>
It seems like you can encourage this sort of behavior by encouraging players to think metaphorically--which, counter some strains of playing, probably encourages more metagame chat (at least metagame thinking)--sort of like "oh, this castle is totally like that prison in a movie I just saw--they broke in by pretending to be doctors...maybe we could act as wealthy merchants and..."<br/>
<br/>
Brainstorming, too, goes a long way--as a group activity, you distribute some of the 'processing' power to others.  In other words, you are varying X to Y, but as soon as you say Y, Joan thinks D, which makes you think of E, and D and E get you F (which is what you wanted all along).<br/>
<br/>
Although, if you do too much of that, you may lose the rhetorical element--the players see so much of the 'guts' of the process that there final answer doesn't seem so 'wow.'  (although I don't think that has to be the case)                        </div>

                            Isbo:<br/><br/>Actually, the current research on expertise suggests that experts aren't any better than ordinary people at applying <i>outside</i> rules to the domain that they're familiar with.  They're no better at transferring in other skills; it's just that they literally see the domain that they're expert at differently.<br/><br/>The classic experiment was done with expert chess players.  They could look at a chessboard mid-game and memorize the layout of the pieces far, far better than a novice player could.  However, when the chess pieces were laid out randomly, the chess experts weren't any better at understanding what was going on than the novices.  In other words, through this and other experiments, they figured out that chess experts see the board in <i>chunks</i> which have a different meaning to them than the individual piece locations that the novices see.<br/><br/>Similarly, physics experts classify and understand problems differently than novices do - not because they are conducting mental experiments, but because they understand better what kinds of similarities, patterns and activities really matter in being able to solve the problem.<br/><br/>Expertise research is fascinating stuff!  I don't know if this is what you were trying to say, but I thought it might be a useful addition to the discussion.  It's also making me want to look at what "story" and "game" experts are better at than novices in both areas!!<br/><br/>That said, I'm wondering if there's something that you (or Tony) can recommend for me to read on abductive reasoning.  It sounds like something I definitely need to know about in more detail than I can necessarily get here.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<br/>
You surely know more than I do on the topic, so perhaps you can clarify this for me.  I remember the research about chess experts, but I thought there were other claims associated with that passle of work.<br/>
<br/>
Way back when (before I was in grad school, which is getting to be a long time ago indeed), I remember reading stuff that went along these lines:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Experts are good at chunking, yes--but also good at manipulating those chunks in their head (i.e. my not-professional-psychologist talk about variation)<br/>
2.  Experts are very good at using analogies--which I have since took to mean something like this--while experts are not better at using rules (bad choice of words on my part) from another domain than anyone else, they are very good at seeing how other domains are 'like' their own and (sloppy terminology ahead) 'interpreting'  those 'foreign' objects (concepts, relations, etc.) so that they can facilitate their own thinking in their domain.<br/>
<br/>
A good example of the (2) would be how Einstein (physics expert) was able to take his experience in the patent office where he was reading a lot about the synchronization of clocks and apply that (analogically) to developing the general theory of relativity.  We don't want to call Einstein an expert in whatever clock synchronization entails (perhaps engineering), but just show how he was able to use that as an analogy for a project within the domain where he had expertise.<br/>
<br/>
Now, is this basically right?  Or has some research qualified this?  Or have I since effectively overcoded what I did know to include all sorts of ideas not contained in the original claims made by researchers into expertise?<br/>

Oh, now we gettin' fancy.  Mr. Lehrich is making use of an even more technical definition of the term abduction--that developed by our good pragmatist Charles Sanders Pierce!  Hmm, this makes me really want to dust off my Americans again...<br/>
<br/>
btw--Jess, if possible, could you toss out a few recent citations about expertise?  One of these days, I should go update my psych tools and it's always good to have an expert point the way ; )                        </div>

I had a friend who depended on abductive reasoning to plan games.  He would plan out these impossible (to his reasoning) situations and let the players' abduction come up with a plausible way out, then roll and shout.  It wasn't real what you might call scientific, but that's what he did, hehe.                        </div>

<i>I'm now more confused now than when Tony started.</i><br/><br/>Oh, sorry, Larry, thread foul ; ) <br/><br/>Let me see if I can state my original point clearly:<br/><br/>Abduction occurs when you posit a possible term in a deductive frame that allows you to draw conclusions of a tentative nature--because (at least) one of your antecedents is not full-proof, the resulting deduction isn't either.  I am that philosophic nitpicker Tony mentions in the abstract ; )<br/><br/>Now, what I think the abduction talk blurs into is the question of roleplaying a story where it isn't simply the case that you have a (probable) set of antecedents and derive a likely conclusion, but where you have an end result  for which you then <b>create</b> the antecedents.  <br/><br/>I introduced the expertise talk largely as an analogy--as someplace you could rip some ideas off for creating an environment that encourages this creation of antecedents where there simply weren't any before.  <br/><br/>I think there are some real structural similarities between abduction and this creation of the antecedents, but I fret about collapsing them.  The link to the Forge article highlights one reason why I dislike fusing them--abduction in a mystery occurs when the antecedent posited as possible ends up being the 'actual' antecedent (here we get to an Ockham's razor situation--abduce multiple antecedents until one is capable of supporting the conclusion and the evidence--i.e. until you reach an antecedent that can be supported by both the deductive and inductive dimensions).<br/><br/>Confusing the two would actually spoil its application in mystery, where the fun is discovering whatis the case, not making things match what you want the case to be. * <br/><br/>The creative version, on the other hand, takes a posited case and *makes* it the case--i.e. makes the deductive and inductive dimensions fall in line with it.  In other words, it bypasses the question of probability and makes it the actuality. <br/><br/>*Although, clearly, a game could exist where determining the mystery would be part of the game, in which case the two get a good deal closer (but I don't think they fuse--but ignore that, it gets us away from the 'core')                        </div>

                            Just a couple of points.<br/><br/>Apologies to go back, but to clear this up:
<blockquote>Hamsterprophet / Graham--Aristotle has some discussion of this (methinks in the Rhetoric stuff, but I may be wrong)--if you are fairly sure that given A and C, most of your audience will think B, you should only present them with A and C, because the effort they make to fill in the middle term gives them a sense of 'ownership' that makes it more likely they will take it at face value.<br/><br/>Which is why I think it makes sense for a GM to 'steal' a player's rationale for why things are happening--the fact that the player came to it on their own, makes it feel more like the 'real thing' to them.</blockquote>
That wasn't quite what I was getting at.<br/><br/>I was making a general point that, if you present people with a problem, they'll often see a solution that, to them, is obvious. Their "obvious" solution won't necessarily be obvious to anyone else. I was just remarking on the brain's ability to solve problems without really thinking about them.<br/><br/>I wasn't suggesting you should present problems in an attempt to guide players towards a solution. (Interestingly enough, considering the conversation we've had about railroading in another thread, I find this a really unpleasant idea. It's interesting, to me, that I react to it that way. But anyway.).<br/><br/>On a wider note: I think this thread's got into trouble because, in his first post, Tony wasn't really talking about reasoning.<br/><br/>To go back to the first post:
<blockquote>But then if I show you a half-completed jigsaw puzzle and a whole box full of pieces and say "Find something that fits," my experience is that you will find a piece which fits somewhere much faster than you would have found the right place for the individual piece. And when I ask you "How did you find that fitting piece" you'll say something like "Oh, I just looked and saw that it would fit."</blockquote>
Now, to me, this doesn't sound like reasoning at all (abductive or otherwise). It's more like intuition. And it's a fascinating topic, but it's slightly and significantly different from abductive reasoning.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Graham--I'm not trying to equate what you said with Aristotle.  I'm trying to use aristotle to extract a secondary claim from what you said: namely, that the rhetorical process by which you have your listener produce the conclusion you want is similar to the process by which you actually create the conclusion without coercion--namely that both make the person feel invested in their idea--that the process of hashing it out on their own makes them feel like it is theirs, and gives it the aura of 'obviousness.'  I.e. with or without coercion, coming to an idea on your own makes you more invested in it than being told it.<br/>
<br/>
I think we are talking about reason-what we call intuition often just seems like reason that has been well learned and insightfully applied without a lot of conscious chatter.  <br/>
<br/>
To Larry: the hair splitting is this: abduction is a stop gap measure, a probable reason that is then used 'as if' if it were the actual reason.  The idea is that if it is the actual reason, then it will be vindicated in practice.  If it is not the right reason, it will be disqualified and we will have to go back to the abduction board.<br/>
<br/>
Tony is actually talking about a creative process in which the reason is created and immediately enters actuality.  There is no need to test its probability--as soon as it is accepted, it is.<br/>
<br/>
The distinction seems important to me because I think you could design a cooperative, sleuthing game rooted in the interweaving of these two elements, in other words create a game in which the distinction makes the game work well.  It seems a good distinction because you can do stuff with it.  I might just try to hash this out in another thread when I'm not racing against the clock--lunch almost over!<br/>
<br/>
funny thing: I'm not really disagreeing with what is being said, just trying to clarify and elaborate upon it.                        </div>

Not them again...I knew I was going have to read them...eventually ; )<br/><br/><i>I don't mean to re-derail the thread</i><br/><br/>Hmmm, sounds like a new thread waiting to happen, we already have an undiagnosed problem (game bleed) just waiting to be solved...                        </div>

<p>Hrm ... I came upon two paths in a wood and ... wait, it's the internet!</p>
<p>Which way do we feel like going on this thread?  Which one should we split off?</p>
<p>How about we talk about the Other Thing here, and someone who actually knows a respectable amount about abductive reasoning can frame that question better in a second thread?</p>
