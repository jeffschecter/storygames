Things like unnecessary negotiations in the least appropriate times, when the action should flow smoothly... which leads towards a polarisation of the GM's role that, instead of facilitating the game and doing their part, is forced to somehow build their own interpretation of "how to play"... which leads back to a tribal state of play where every table almost plays a different game than anyone else.<br/>Fortunately we're not talking about a phenomenon as marked as what happens with traditional/incoherent games. But that's the same general direction. And to me, this is problem enough.<br/><br/>So when designing my moves I attempt to support both GM and Players with a text that is as unambiguous as possible to minimise negotiation. It has to be clear, so clear it is obvious by just looking at the fiction, if a Move is triggered or not.<br/><br/>I don't believe perfect clarity is humanly achievable. But I firmly believe that the current state of things has plenty of room to improve towards that direction. This is my attempt to move towards that direction.<br/><br/>This ties deeply with the Fictional Harm System described in my previous post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467105/#Comment_467105" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-19T13:52:44+00:00" title="October 19, 2017  1:52PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HACK &amp; SLASH ... WHY?</span></b><br/>[This is not in the book; it is just me commenting on the above mechanics]<br/><br/>The reason behind this version of the H&amp;S move is that I want H&amp;S to not be a the "generic attack" that it too often ends up being in both DW and many other PbtA games.<br/>I want it to trigger during a melee.<br/>And I want a melee to feel dangerous.<br/>And I want skilled fighters to be able to get more out of it than just hurting one another.<br/>And I want it to be clear that if you get into a melee you will get hurt, and you will hurt someone.<br/><br/>A friendly duel? Not H&amp;S.<br/>Attacking someone that is not attacking you? Not H&amp;S.<br/>Attacking someone that is unable to meaningfully hurt you? Not H&amp;S.<br/>Attacking someone you can't meaningfully hurt? Not H&amp;S.<br/>Being clever and describing an attack that is truly aimed at producing some special effect, rather than hurting someone? Not H&amp;S.<br/><br/>H&amp;S is what you get for not being able to come up with anything better than "I attack". It exposes and damages you; in the end is a losing game. Although, on the short term, you might achieve important results that maybe are worth the effort.<br/><br/>Putting H&amp;S together with the Fictional Harm System (FHS) is also important.<br/>I was always positively impressed by the (in)famous "<i>16HP Dragon</i>" example, especially the part where the adventurers swing their swords at the dragon, are already grabbing the dice to H&amp;S, and the GM stops them: <i>nope, a simple swords, no matter how cool, can't do shit against what amounts to a building covered by metal plates 1cm thick ... think of something else to do</i>.<br/>The problem there was that it felt arbitrary. It blindsided the Players. And I heard/read a LOT of people complain against such use of the rules because they felt it actually moved <b>outside of the rules</b> as they perceived them: if I swing my sword at the beats, it is H&amp;S, and I must roll.<br/><br/>The FHS prevents this all.<br/>It focuses everyone's attention on the fiction, first and foremost, and offers a normal, non-exceptional, base to establish that yes, indeed swinging a puny sword is useless against a metal tank.<br/>There are no mechanical alibis.<br/>And if someone disagrees, it will be brought to light early and cleanly.<br/>At least, that's what these rules hope to facilitate <img alt=":mrgreen:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/mrgreen.png" title=":mrgreen:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467106/#Comment_467106" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-19T13:53:04+00:00" title="October 19, 2017  1:53PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THREATEN ... WHY?</span></b><br/>[This is not in the book; it is just me commenting on the above mechanics]<br/><br/>I always loved the sentiment behind <b>Go Aggro</b>, but I also always had problems when using that move in actual play. "Luckily" I was not the only one :P<br/>With the Threaten move I hope to fix that.<br/><br/>First I clarified the fictional trigger.<br/>I've read with great interest many discussions about Go Aggro and how it was supposed to work, but even after Vincent himself pitched in, I was not satisfied.<br/><br/>A famous example is this:<br/>A PC with a chainsaw shouts threats from outside the gates of a city against a target character, while the target is safely withing the city ... roll to Go Aggro ... 10+ ... the target chooses to force the PC's hand, which results in... nothing... because there is no way for the PC to actually harm the target, so harm as established is nothing.<br/>Makes perfect sense.<br/>But I can't help but feel that something is wrong.<br/>Just like with H&amp;S... if the action is useless and can't produce the expected effect, it should not be triggered in the first place.<br/><br/>So I changed the trigger in a way that makes this clear and unambiguous.<br/><br/><b>You are about to  inflict physical harm</b>. You are there. You are able to do it. You are almost already doing it.<br/>If not, this is not the move.<br/><br/><b>You are doing this to have them say or do something.</b><br/>There is a clear intention behind your violence.<br/>I've seen often Go Aggro be triggered by Players that were just having their PC posing and posturing, be cool and badass. It fit the trigger, but it did not fit the effects of the roll.<br/>So you need something from them.<br/>If not, this is not the move.<br/><br/><b>You are instructed to clearly express what it is your PC wants.</b><br/>Many times I have seen awkward moments come out of Players trying to "play-act" what their PC wanted from the target of a Go Aggro. Many times I have seen GMs assume they understood, and pick one of the possible effects of the move, and totally miss what the Player hoped for; in turn seeing such Players feel robbed of an earned victory (<i>I rolled well, didn't I?</i>).<br/><br/>And then comes the result of the roll.<br/>Go Aggro was always intended to show the brutality of using violence as a means to bossing people around.<br/>But this is emotional, this is harsh, and not everyone is ok with it... which is OK, but then you should not use violence as a tool to boss people around.<br/>That's the whole point of the move, to me.<br/>You REALLY use violence to boss people around? Then prepare to hurt them, because they might force your hand.<br/><br/>This is all very nice, but again, not clearly enforced by the mechanics. I believe everyone is familiar with the looong discussions about people attempting Go Aggro with no real intention of going through with the violence... which in the best of cases leads the GM to negotiate the clarification of the PC's intentions: are you REALLY going to shoot if they don't comply? Yes? No? Then it is the Manipulate move (<i>which for me has always been another critical can of worm of PbtA games, by the way</i>).<br/><br/>My mechanics remove this ambiguity.<br/><br/>You are about to hurt someone.<br/>You do it for a practical and clear reason.<br/>You roll 10+ ... your victory is that <b>you are in control</b> of the situation.<br/>They do it?<br/>Good.<br/>They don't do it? (because you never take away a PC's freedom)<br/>Then <b>you choose</b> to hurt them as promised, or not. The choice is yours, but at a price. You scare someone, you threaten them, you <b>abuse</b> them, and then you hesitate and show that you were "just talk" after all. Sure, you can do it, it is the moral and noble (the human?) thing to do. But chances are this will hurt you back, or at least give a chance to the GM to make your life more interesting.<br/><br/>You are about to hurt someone.<br/>You do it for a practical and clear reason.<br/>You roll 7-9 ... your victory is that you force a meaningful (maybe useful) reaction out of them, but you are <b>not in control</b> of the situation.<br/>Shit happens and your hand is forced. No choice here. You hurt them. You were about to, and there is no toying around with violence.<br/><br/>This is the crux of it, to me. This truly removes the ambiguity. This follows through with what the move initiated, without stealing the victory from the Player. This delivers the message.<br/>If you use violence, things <b>will</b> get ugly.<br/>Player intention becomes irrelevant.<br/>You don't want this?<br/>Then don't describe your PC using violence to threaten people.<br/><br/>This too leverages the FHS, as then the GM can use harm on the NPCs for all sorts of "<i>through the crosshair</i>" dramatic effects as Fictional Harm is concrete and meaningful. No abstract 1 damage. A single "Nasty" harm can render an NPC unconscious, a single "Serious" harm can leave a permanent scar or disability.<br/><br/>On the other hand if a PC makes abstract threats, it can only possibly be <b>Manipulate</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467107/#Comment_467107" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-19T13:53:09+00:00" title="October 19, 2017  1:53PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO VOLLEY ... WHY?</span></b><br/>[This is not in the book; it is just me commenting on the above mechanics]<br/><br/>In my PbtA Fantasy game there is no <i>Volley</i> move.<br/><br/>One reason is that I never found that Move interesting; in the original DW it only seemed to be there to make you spend ammunition. It felt like one of those legacy thing you have to have in the game because everyone else has it too. These are not enough reason for me, especially because I'm trying to streamline and minimise resource bookkeeping (ammunition, food, coins, etc).<br/><br/>Another reason is that I want violence to have more weight and meaning in this game, as my long winded analysis of H&amp;S and Threaten might have made clear. <br/>I want Violence to be a powerful tool to solve problems, but with consequences, to be "brutal" even when embellished by the narrative of fantasy adventuring.<br/>The original Volley expressed none of this, and all the many variations I found floating around the web too. After much pondering I opted to just drop the move.<br/><br/>Besides, what are you doing in the fiction anyway?<br/>When you HnS you are exchanging blows in a furious melee.<br/>When you Threaten you are having your hand forced in a tense situation.<br/>But when you Volley?<br/>In the fiction you are simply pointing an thing towards a distant target thing, trying to perform skillfully no matter how chaotic the situation is.<br/>Maybe you want the thing to go through the target's skull.<br/>Maybe you want the thing to hit something different to achieve a specific effect.<br/>Either way it looks an awful lot like a simple <b>Defy Danger</b>.<br/>So that's what I am using... good old Defy Danger.

I might recommend either more choices period (2 on a 7+, 3 on a 10+?) or the ability to trade (e.g. I choose an additional option, the MC gets an additional Hard Move).  Just a thought.<br/><br/>As for Threaten, I think it resolves a problem -- Going Aggro for no reason, or when you can't attack -- that I haven't really encountered.

I mean, I usually ask them "how do you do that?" explaining them the opponent's situation and guard for the players to come up with an informed response. Maybe I'll use gestures to get things clear or give them suggestions: "Do you swing your axe like this or <i>like this</i>?" "Are you aiming for a particular spot, or attacking with a particular goal?".<br/><br/>My group won't usually go for way too fancy things, with some exceptions; so after the roll I use the result as a gauge to add something else to the fiction. Most of the things I'd add are listed in the moves here, though I'd let things flow more organically depending on the fiction and the players input. This is part of what I get the moves here, get how they could perfectly work, but still feel a bit rigid for me. <br/><br/>I mean, they work perfectly if players just say "I attack" and roll, then it's up to the mechanic, the players and the narrator to choose from the given options to finally come up with a description of how the scene turns out. If players or the GM have a bit more specific goals in mind, I guess the move can adapt just fine. But I believe that just asking "and how do you do that?" might give enough data to the GM and the players to entirely avoid additional moves that engage only on very specific circumstances.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467115/#Comment_467115" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-19T20:16:18+00:00" title="October 19, 2017  8:16PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" rel="nofollow">Hasimir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>"<i>force your hand</i>" means "<i>you inflict harm to them</i>" ...

Like most moves. The introspective part is there too, but I would not use those 3 steps.\n<blockquote><br/>1) I'm initiating the threat of violence. What's their initial reaction?<br/>2) They're giving me inconclusive feedback. Do I want to bring my threat closer to reality, or even just follow through on it?<br/>3) Now it's clear that they aren't going to comply. It's on me to either follow through or not, right now.</blockquote>\nThe problem in my mind is that people don't think threats are already "real" violence.<br/>So they create an imaginary wall between the initial false-violence and the later true-violence.<br/>Then they add one more layer of separation by adding the fact that true-violence is actually only a possibility.<br/><br/>I would like to rip off this safe fantasy.<br/><br/>The instant you "<i>initiate the threat of violence</i>" you are already <b>being violent</b>.<br/>And the move ensures that there will be a meaningful reaction.<br/>That's your payoff.<br/>Your win condition.<br/>The point of the roll is then to see <b>how much control</b> you can exert on the situation.<br/><br/>With 10+ you have much more control; they believe. Problem is... it is <b>not</b> Manipulate. <br/>You don't achieve cooperation. <br/>You achieve violence.<br/>And people can have all sorts of reactions to violence.<br/>Maybe they comply... that's a possibility.<br/>Maybe they don't... and for good or ill they force your hand.<br/>But it's a 10+ ... you are in control ... you can choose to stop being violent (read well: not "choose to not be violent", but rather "stop being violent", because you are already violent).<br/>But they believe you are violent, they chose to resist to your violence, and you hesitate, so it's their move, and I'm thinking it should be as Hard as the GM sees fit.<br/><br/>With 7-9 you still win.<br/>You ensue a meaningful reaction.<br/>That's the payoff of the move.<br/>But you have <b>less control</b>. Somehow the situation devolves in a way where you, maybe against your own planning and best judgement, act on the threat. Then you get your meaningful consequence in the form of the list of options they have to choose from.<br/><br/>This fits the message I want the moves to deliver: direct and blatant violence might be effective, but for sure is not pretty nor "efficient" ... it's messy, and comes at a price.<br/><br/>H&amp;S is the same.<br/>The baseline is: you get hurt AND you hurt someone.<br/>If you use that, just charging ahead into a melee rather than coming up with a more focused, cleverer plan, then that's what you get: a hot mess where something useful can be salvaged.<br/>The "good" effects are so few for the same reason. Most of the times (7-9) you only get 1 hold.<br/>Want to spend it always to protect your ass? Fine.<br/>But the one time you hope to achieve something more/different than standard damage to the opponent, THEN you have an interesting choice in your hands. This, to me, is the value and fun of H&amp;S: waging personal safety against the achievement of your goals.<br/><br/>Likewise Threaten is not Manipulate.<br/>If you convince someone somehow to cooperate, that's the win. You get a safer, stabler, more predictable outcome.<br/>If you add real immediate violence to this equation, they can't ignore you, but they are also less predictable and controllable.<br/><br/>That, I think, as I'm thinking this stuff up while I write it*, is the game vision I would like to convey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*And that's the reason why these threads are so useful to me!

I've been struggling with this for years too! It's true, people just don't, and those who do have interiorized it so much they think that<i>it's natural to do so</i> and that <i>everybody should already know this</i>. The worst was that designers thought that these ritual phrases weren't important at all, while they actually are the core of the game and help a lot more to understand the very nature of the game designed. Those phrases will actually change from one game to another in subtle forms that should be considered by the designer to help players achieve the experience meant by the game.<br/><br/>The thing is that these ritual phrases should be enforced by the game rules in somewhat hardcoded procedures. Not only because trad players won't use them or that people will disregard them as "good playing advice" that they don't need, but because they are as important as all other rules for the game to generate a particular experience in a proper and efficient way. <br/><br/>Moves were a great step in that sense, so no wonder they have become so popular. It's one of the nicest implementations for explaining the Narrator and the players what kind of things they could say in many different situations to keep the game going and avoid most immersion breaking situations. Game design is going in a good direction there, though things could still be a bit more clear. Or maybe the same games could use minimized moves (or just the ritual phrases) for more experienced players to use when they have interiorized the extended ones. <br/><br/>Also, all Input sources should be considered to make the exchange more fluid, as focusing in a single one seems to me to actually make things more cumbersome. Like, all right, GM input in the shape of prep or impro has worked for years, but something as simple as mountain-witching the layers or paying attention to their flags is a major input source that not only relieves the GM work but creates player investment as a byproduct. Using the dice as a oracle is another perfect source of input as well as random tables of all sorts. And there's also the designer's input in the rules and the setting or the modules as well. All these sources create problems when a single one is abused, but when combined they help immensely to generate Flow in the most efficient way.<br/><br/>But that's outside the scope here. My apologies for the derail, but finally talking a bit of this in a context as clear as your game is liberating Hasimir, thanks. Btw, the revised move looks better now, despite most of what I expressed above, I've got no real complaints about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467144/#Comment_467144" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-21T04:28:23+00:00" title="October 21, 2017  4:28AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2017 4:30AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that new wording for Threaten is unambiguous with one exception.  Without being quite sure what you like about Go Aggro in the first place, I don't know if other trade-offs have been made.  "You describe how they force your hand" is super interesting.  It might significantly change the way it feels... or not.  I'd have to try it.<br/><br/>The one exception:<br/>"When you are about to cause immediate physical harm to someone" sounds to me like your fist is in motion and only their clear and instant compliance can halt it.  But then later I see "- - you refuse to hurt them, but the GM makes a Hard Move", so I guess my prior impression was not necessarily correct.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the only way I can think improve upon the clarity here would be quite clunky.  But oh well, here it is:\n<blockquote><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Threaten</span></b><br/>When you are about to cause immediate physical harm to someone* to have them say or do something...<br/><br/>...explain clearly what you want them to do, then roll+CHA.<br/><br/>[outcome lists]<br/><br/>*or reveal that your threat was a bluff by <i>not</i> causing them immediate physical harm</blockquote>\nThinking more on Threaten / Go Aggro, I wonder if it'd be fun to play a game where <i>all</i> the moves were "roll to make something interesting happen, but only 50% of it will be what you were aiming for".

So, you haven't brought violence to bear yet, but they are clearly influenced. The image is of someone intimidated, who managed to forestall violence but is frightened/cowed/whatever.<br/><br/>(Other notable differences: they can't choose to cave on a 7-9, and you get to describe how they force your hand. Also important!)<br/><br/>In your version, on a 7-9 you harm them, every time. And *then* they choose an option. This is a very different dynamic - they are the victim of your violence.<br/><br/>To me, this would require different options. "Tell them what they want to hear" is great. But you stab me with a knife, and I "back off calmly, hands where you can see"? That's just weird; it doesn't flow. Something like "cower, clutching their wounds" would be more appropriate.<br/><br/>It says *very* different things about the nature of the world you're playing in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467166/#Comment_467166" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-21T23:25:29+00:00" title="October 21, 2017 11:25PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great observations <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> !<br/>I'll work on that, it makes great sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
