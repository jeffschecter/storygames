One worked and one didn't work as well.<br/><br/>Firstly, we tried playing in 1930s England, in an Agatha Christie-esque setting: a small village, a church, tea with the vicar. The franchise was based in the church hall. This worked brilliantly. <br/><br/>Secondly, we tried a futuristic setting: London in 2150, which was semi-flooded. The franchise was based in a former Starbucks in a shopping mall. This didn't work so well and I can't quite explain why. It just didn't seem to catch fire.<br/><br/>My feeling is that the setting works similarly to the characters: the best ones are pretty normal, making the weird stuff funny by contrast. Overtly quirky settings, although they seem immediately funny, are actually less effective, which I think may have been the problem with our futuristic setting.<br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156606/#Comment_156606" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T06:03:52+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  6:03AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That seems right to me.  The juxtaposition of mundane and fantastic is part of why the game is so fun.

Much of the comedy in InSpectres comes from incongruity.  Having a ghost turn up in your local KFC and start animating dead poultry is pretty easy to make funny.  Having it happen in a flooded and alien London and still be funny sounds like much harder work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156645/#Comment_156645" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-15T09:20:02+00:00" title="July 15, 2008  9:20AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only had luck running extremely mundane settings: Our own city, in an industrial park, with ancient evil getting stirred up by the city's light rail project. Or in another of our games, we operated a home business in a house that was about to be foreclosed.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if InSpectres really can be run "straight." If I were to use the engine to run a straight game, I'd probably recast the franchise rules, and recast the Confessional like in UnSpeakable. Maybe a flashback or PTSD episode? Maybe a debriefing, in a corporate/cyberpunk type of setting. <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157144/#Comment_157144" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T08:32:58+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  8:32AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "straight" InSpectres is tougher than "funny" because with the rules for narration how they are, it's relatively easy to inject incongruous ideas into the game. The humor just arises as naturally as making a joke or funny comment.<br/><br/>But, if you use something like the X-files or Supernatural as a reference, it becomes a little easier to straighten up. Both of those series have their funny and serious moments, and both are about the investigation of the supernatural. If everyone is on the same page, I don't know why it wouldn't work. Well... except for the franchise stuff like the bank dice...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
