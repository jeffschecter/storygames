Thinking about it, it ends up being a hack of Sorensen's Lacuna.<br/>\nThe point is to create a story now game centered on a narration that develops in a chinese box game way, that is, a game made of nested narrations on different layers. The inspiration is the movie Inception.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we have agents that deal with the mindscape of a person. I suggest it to be a 2 players game, one gm and one player, so as not to make things too complicated, but this could change as the brainstorming goes on.<br/>\nIt should be a game where each narration level influences the previous, upper one (as the narration goes deeper and deeper in the target's mindscape).<br/>\nOne player plays the agent and the other player plays the mindscape. The agent sets a stake, which is the ultimate goal in entering the "victim's" mindscape. Getting an important information, stealing it, erasing it, changing it, installing an idea. The movie is going to be your main reference on that.<br/>\nI like going for the obvious as I'm a fervent follower of the keep-it-simple rule: the most obvious way to travel to a deeper level of the mindscape would be escalating in a conflict. As you escalate, you go deeper into the mindscape.<br/>\nEach level has a different threat or opposition. Which could be represented by drawing a tarot card from the major arcana in order to take inspiration.<br/>\nBut how does a conflict work and what's the agent's risk. Well, here we get to why this game might work as a Lacuna hack. I like the bps mechanics, although it never worked as a significant indicator of threat with me. So let's say our agents have a stress threshold, and some "flags" or link. As you get deeper into another person's subconscious, you're also going to face your inner demons. Just like in Inception.<br/>\nWe're going to use poker cards for conflict resolution mechanics, and we want to make sure that the character is going to have to escalate a lot. If a conflict in a mindscape level is not escalated, we consider it simply solved. Minor conflicts could be ok with you but when we get to the real one, where the agent faces the mindscape's opposition, we want the conflict to be more likely to escalate and take the character to a deeper level of the mindscape itself. The transition works just like in the movie Inception: an eyeblink and the transition takes place. One moment you were facing a monster of the subconscious, the next moment you're on a seashore entirely made of red seashells (just to make a banal picture).<br/>\nYou're the mindscape and I'm the agent.<br/>\nAt the first level of the mindscape, you draw two cards, I draw four cards. When a conflict arises, we reveal our hands and determine how the conflict is carried on. The higher card wins the conflict. Total up the black cards' number. That's the damage dealt to the character's threshold (the bps raising). The number of red cards is the number of cards the character draw in the next mindscape level. We both discard our hands after each conflict. If there's more black cards than red cards, mark a trait of the character. The mindscape may bring it now in play or store it for later, and call a conflict on it. Were you afraid of the dark as a child? Now the dark comes after you. Any trauma your subconscious buried from you will be something you have to face (that has to be determined at character creation, of course).<br/>\nThe mindscape's hand is raised by one card in each level after the first. It has two cards in the first level, three in the second, etc.<br/>\nWhenever you face the mindscape, there's really no actual stake but survival. It's a hostile environment you're facing. <br/>\nWhenever the character interacts with the mindscape, the mindscape draws a card and adds it to its hand. Sooner or later the mindscape is going aggro on the agent. Mind you, that doesn't mind necessarily that things turn to the agent and start beating him. It may be that the scene shifts into a crisis situation. That's when a conflict arises and players reveal their hands.<br/>\nLet's say the agent wins the conflict. The stake is won, the hands are discarded, the agent draw four cards, the mindscape draws the initial number of cards relative to that level (two at first, three at second, etc).<br/>\nIf the character loses, he can escalate. The conflict freezes. The character goes deeper into the next level and a tarot is drawn. The next opposition is inspired from it, and the stake must be something that will make the character win the conflict in the previous level. So let's say you end up in a torture chamber. The conflict is about getting away from it. The agent tries, it's a conflict, but he fails, so he escalates and goes deeper one level. The stake that should be found here might be a key that open the torture chamber's lock. Am I making sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, but how does this all relate to the initial stake, the very reason why the agent is risking his life entering an hostile mindscape?<br/>\nEach level contains one part of the puzzle. Getting it is matter of winning a conflict in that level. The number of puzzles depends on the difficulty of the initial stake. Gaining an information is easy (two pieces), while installing an idea is the most difficult one (five pieces).<br/>\nOnce the character gets all of them, he wins the final stake and can go back home.<br/>\nAs soon as the character's threshold is filled, he is "killed" in the mindscape and has to eject.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, this is what I could come up with in one hour of thinking... it may be a senseless blubbering, in case please accept my apologies and disregard. If you can make sense of what I'm saying and/or find the idea decent enough, suggestions and ideas would be welcome...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
