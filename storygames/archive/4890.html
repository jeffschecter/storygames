Some of you are aware of how unlikely that would seem considering my view of that game but my players have spoken.<br/><br/>So I appraoched D&amp;D in a different way than I had in the past.  in the past I have applied some Story Games technigues and yet other times I just rewrote the rules to something unrecognizable.  Each time I have a select group of friends that say "but we're no longer playing DnD."  Now I am fully aware of some of the obstacles involved when dealing with childhood nostalgia and gamer egos but when I have a few players that say "I want to do a long DnD campign where we basically go from level 1 to 20" it's hard to wiggle out of it - and well, they are my peeps.<br/><br/>So I set myself to the challenge.  How do I run a long term DnD campaign that is satisfying to the players, something I can enjoy yet not have to develop too much up front yet still fulfill certain players ideas of what makes a game DnD.  I have also been psyched about 4th Edition and would see this as an opportunity to make some sort of transition.<br/><br/>Then I realized what I was doing.  My goal was just to do what every GM I ever met has been doing with DnD since it was set to paper - house rules.  By have a few focused house rules I think I will be able to retain some of the flavor yet make certain we tell a good yarn in the process and keep everyone involved in the process.<br/><br/>How do I make this game stay DnD yet still reduce "20 minutes of fun in 4 hours?"  How do I approach player buyin and authorship while maintaining a strong GM stance?  <br/><br/>One of the answers I found through video games.  In many video game RPGs you have locations that you are able to explore but often they have a particular goal and you can't do anything in that location that it was not programmed to do.  I saw many traditional gamers balk at the idea that THEY would have to initiate scenes and conflicts.  So I created locales that had explicit purposes for the PCs yet still retained the feel of the locales in a traditional game.  My idea there being that if the players what's to have a particular scene ie. has a goal in mind, they head off to a preset locale which has it's goals and conflicts largely hard-coded into it with a little wiggle room for narration.<br/><br/>The whole answer was too complicated and long to go over it in great detail here but I REALLY would like your input.  I'd love other people to try this out and tell me what your experiences were or just peruse these ideas and tell me what your concerns ir reactions are.  In truth I'd even think about this as a beta to a possible supplement but I've not committed to that just yet.<br/><br/>Check out my answer to these question in my <i>Wizard's campaign</i> *blog posts on the <a href="http://www.realityvault.net" rel="nofollow">REALITY VAULT</a>.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance for your time and comments,<br/>- Don<br/><br/><i>*Editted out the specific blog since I hav a more updated document below</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109663/#Comment_109663" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T11:31:11+00:00" title="November 26, 2007 11:31AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don -- <br/><br/>One thing I've heard you say that I thought was really neat was your idea of incorporating basic player choices about where to go and what do into a kind of "currency of scenes" wherein the choice to, say, visit a cartographer <i>here</i> unlocked the possibility of being able to explore a hitherto-unknown site <i>there</i>, or to train with your sword <i>now</i> unlocked the possibility of a balls-to-the-wall battle <i>later</i>. I'm not sure I understood correctly, but it seemed like an elegant amalgamation of video-game pragmatics with story-game sensibilities. I'd be interested in hearing more about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109677/#Comment_109677" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T12:24:17+00:00" title="November 26, 2007 12:24PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Talk to Ben about his Final Fantasy hack of TSOY.

Yeah, that's about right, Bill.  It streamlines prep considerably making research, exploration, travel, training and the final conflicts less of a guessing game.  Sure, I will retain some "mysteries" while other aspects of the game will be out in the open but the explicit purpose of secrets is to reveal them on a pretty regular basis.  The secrets allow for a steady reveal of this sort as well.  I just think the players will get a strong idea of "here's my person and group goals and this is how I want to go about it.  Now I just need to go see this guy."<br/><br/>Johnathan,  I will check out Ben's FF setup.  That sounds on target to the goal.  Gosh, Loresheets.  I have a love/cringe relationship with WotG.  I love everything it does but it's SO complicated and there is SO much prep and pre-established stuff.  It's really dense.  I want the density to come from play but I see where you're going with that.

In the d20 campaigns I GMed the following things worked (a lot of this is in retrospect, I didn't really have a very good idea of what I was doing at the time):<br/><br/>1. Don't try to make D&amp;D not be D&amp;D. Play good D&amp;D not a mediocre hybrid of your favorite game and D&amp;D.<br/>2. There must be lots of combat. Combat all over the place.<br/>3. Make the combat fun. D&amp;D can devolve quickly into Roll to hit/roll for damage/repeat boredom so you have to shake things up. Include funky monster special abilities, pits of lava, collapsing buildings. There's a good guide in the Iron Heroes book about how to do this. Basically spice up the combat but keep things grounded in D&amp;D rules.<br/>4. Make time be an important resource and keep the PCs going in a hurry, otherwise they'll rest after every fight.<br/>5. 3.5ed D&amp;D rules are based around the assumption that players that players will have a certain amount of magic bling at certain levels if you don't give them the bling (or something that makes their characters more powerful) balance will get thrown off, especially AC.<br/>6. Reward sneaky battle tactics and cleverness and put in situations in which cleverness is rewarded that don't pixelbitch.<br/>7. Big mysterious guy tells you to do X plots are boring, don't do them.<br/>8. Use bangs, bangs work great in D&amp;D but they must be D&amp;D-appropriate bangs. Give the players a good idea of what's going on and then make a problem come up that they have to fix. Don't make them existential or character-focused make them more "oh fuck, shit is going to go down unless we do something, we can't just sit on our hands, we have to take action!" and then roll with whatever the players decide to do and make sure whatever they decide to do requires fighting, lots of fighting, not snooping around and talking to umpteen NPCs.<br/>9. The kind of feeling you want after a good D&amp;D session on the players part is "damn, we just barely made it out of there alive, damn were we smart and lucky."<br/>10. Good D&amp;D roleplaying ISN'T sitting around talking its beating heads in in a way that fits you character. Give the players opportunities to roleplay through combat. <br/><br/>The way I prepared for d20 adventure was to make a bunch of NPCs, stat them out (with mostly involved recycling old stats from old NPCs and tweaking them a bit) give them reasons to hate each other and to get involved with the PCs, make up some mook stats to throw in, maybe make up a location or two and make up the rest of the locations on the fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109786/#Comment_109786" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T07:09:54+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  7:09AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2007 9:36PM by eruditus.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I went back and reread all the Wizards entries and , boy, are they a mess.<br/><br/>I had every intention to rewrite them but with the frist session looming on Thursday (YAY!)

Although these tips you give to GMs (things I can confirm have worked for me for decades now) don't answer some of the problems I am trying to address.<br/><br/>For instance:<br/>Only Four Classes - by sticking to the age-old core classes I avoid wierd class combos, have more broad appeal, ignore the diareah-of-the-prestige-class that litters d20 and gear up for an easier transition to 4th Edition.<br/><br/>Secrets Instead of Experience - fantasy wizards are all about gathering arcane knowledge and weilding fantastic power.  Secrets not only bring the reward system closer to being something more than a set of numbers it informs the fiction, builds plot and fills out the details of the fantasy world THEY want to play in.  <br/><br/>Locales Make the Game TRULY Site Based - Players are always guessing at what the GM has planned or what they should do in a game.  It becomes the GMs job to guide the players, entertain them with activities they are interested in and play the NPCs.  My Locales idea will let the players take the reins without the scary scene setting that makes some players squirrelly.  It also mimics a powerful D&amp;D tool - games like Neverwinter Nights.  By approaching the game in a manner many players are used to yet adding the full interactivity of NPCs and a plot that truly react to them the players can be comfortable being more proactive and allows for long term goals and how they will appraoch those goals.<br/><br/>Spellcraft Paramount - Since feats and special abilities are not the focus of what Wizards do then Spellcasting needs to have enough weight and intriquacies to keep the player's attention for 20 levels.  You add excitement and mystery to an otherwise blah, rote system by allowing Wizards the same possible highs and lows other classes have access to (namely criticals and such).<br/><br/>Crafting Is About Economics - There are some minor changes to allow craftsmanship to be something that a wizard can focus on or hire others to help them with.  It's meant to make craftsman interesting and important and incorporate them as part of an economy.  Besides we streamlines the economy down to platinum to abstract some of the coin counting.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109808/#Comment_109808" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T08:25:15+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  8:25AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daztur</cite>I would highly recommend avoiding over-thinking things and doing much in the way of house-ruling (aside from strictly Gamist house-ruling to get rid of cheesy things).

Don't make them existential or character-focused make them more "oh fuck, shit is going to go down unless we do something, we can't just sit on our hands, we have to take action!" and then roll with whatever the players decide to do and make sure whatever they decide to do requires fighting, lots of fighting, not snooping around and talking to umpteen NPCs.<br/>9. The kind of feeling you want after a good D&amp;D session on the players part is "damn, we just barely made it out of there alive, damn were we smart and lucky."<br/>10. Good D&amp;D roleplaying ISN'T sitting around talking its beating heads in in a way that fits you character. Give the players opportunities to roleplay through combat.<br/></blockquote>\nYesyesyesyesyesGODyes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109975/#Comment_109975" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T07:41:47+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  7:41AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2007 7:42AM by buzz.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>YesyesyesyesyesGODyes.</blockquote>\nSeconded. The day I stopped trying to make D&amp;D into something other than D&amp;D is the day I learned how to love it.<br/><br/>I'm currently running <i>Eyes of the Lich Queen</i>, an Eberron mega-adventure from WotC. I've learned a lot from it recently, both positive and negative.<br/><br/>Positive: the book suggests that you start the whole adventure by cutting directly to the first combat. Just roll initiative and jump in. Then, after the fight is over, flash back to the scene where the big mysterious guy initially hires the PCs and play out how you got into that first fight. This worked awesomely. I used it again for the start of the second chapter, and I predict I will use it a lot for D&amp;D in general. It totally avoids the whole whole pretense of whether the PCs will accept the job or not.<br/><br/>Negative: There are nonetheless parts of the book where you're literally told to let the PCs wander around trying to figure out how to get the next part of the adventure, as well as lots of pointless skill checks to get needed info. My lesson was to blow by all of this. Get the PCs the info they need to move the game to points where interesting decisions can be made. I'm very explicit about "this is an info-dump" and "this is an encounter." One might worry that this makes the game feel too much like a video-game, e.g., combat, cut-scene, combat, cut-scene, etc. In play, it hasn't felt that way at all. Players want to participate; minimize the parts of where they can't and maximize the parts where they can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110186/#Comment_110186" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-28T21:34:46+00:00" title="November 28, 2007  9:34PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark, that's cool stuff.  I love playing with chronology like that.  It's frustrating because even when I give players free reign to do flashbacks and foreshadowing they still tend to plod along ont point to the next.<br/><br/>I am really going to be flexing the agrresive scene framing muscles for this campaign.  And it's a video game that I am really going for, as I mentioned above.  The only difference is thet I didn't need to write or read the plot.<br/><br/>I went over some critters today and stated formulating a few plot ideas to create overarching conflicts they have to handle but those won't get solidified until our character creation session when I get a better idea how to motivate them.<br/><br/>BTW I've done more on the document.  It's not as complete as I'd like but certainly enough to start things out with. You can read what I've done <a href="http://www.realityvault.net/WIZARDS/wizards_11-28_10pm.pdf" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>.  (note: I removed previous links)<br/><br/>Here is an example of a Locale's Scene Type (I will post actual Locales as we play).  A scene type is linked to a Locale that the player has on a map.  There are other statistics to the Locale such as the Name and Level of the Locale but Scene Type defines what the player character does at that Locale.  Many of these are means to and end - the end being finding places that challenege the Wizards in a variety of ways. I am hoping, however, that by having the mechanics of everything else written out that there will be less dawdling about.\n<blockquote><br/><b>Exploration</b><br/><b>Purpose:</b> To find other Locales<br/>Test: Gather Information, Knowledge<br/><b>NPCs: </b>Guide<br/><b>Play it Out:</b> The character either gains the name of a new Locale during a research scene and asks if the Guide has heard anything about it or the character may ask the Guide if he's heard of any place like what he's looking for.  The Guide strokes his chin and fills in a detail about what he's heard of the place (putting in a statistic of the Locale).  The player can offer a alternate or additional detail and makes a Knowledge roll.  Failure means the detail is definitely wrong when the Locale is finally built.  The NPC and the character go back and forth like this twice more before the Gather Information roll is made.  If the Guide is friendly or helpful then there will be a +1 insight bonus to the roll.  The character may also buy tools like maps, compasses and other traveling gear at a Barter Locale for further bonuses.<br/><br/>A map has three statistics, Center, Scope and Detail. Center is where the center of the map lies, Scope is how far from the center it covers and Detail is the equipment bonus it conveys to the Exploration test.  A player may detail an unused Secret to place a Locale on the map as the map's center.  Otherwise it's center is the Barter Locale the map is bought from.  It is assumed that a map includes how to get to the center Locale.   A map's scope is local, rural or travel. (see rules for travel and time).  Detail has a maximum equipment bonus of +3 unless the map is magical.  <br/><br/>Map Costs starts at 1pp.  Rural scope adds 1PP or travel scope adds 2pp to the current cost of the map.  Multiply the current cost by the map's detail bonus to get it's final value.<br/><br/>Compasses confer an insight bonus of +1 or +2 for a masterwork compass.  A compass is valued at 2pp or 20pp if it's masterwork.<br/> <br/><b>Success: </b> The player adds a new Locale of the requested description to their map and journal<br/><b>Failure:</b> The player adds a new Locale to their map and journal however it's type is undetermined until it is visited.  The GM determines what the Locale is and cannot make it a Locale of the requested Type, although other details may be similar.  (see Unknown Vistas)  Alternatively the GM may spend a character's Calamity Chip in order to cause some issue with the Exploration Locale.  The Guide's attitude may drop and cause an adverse effect on future explorations until an Exposition Scene fixes the rift their friendship.  Otherwise this could be a hook for a possible Conquest Locale where the character may need to rescue or otherwise find his missing Guide the next time the wizard visits this Locale.  Those details will be written in the GM's journal and revealed the next time the character visits this Locale (although the players know that he spent a Calmity Chip and gave them the Locale they asked for, an event that the players should always be wary about).<br/><b>Setup: </b> Only the stats on the Guide need to be determined.<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110231/#Comment_110231" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T06:37:10+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  6:37AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don, this is badassness and pretty much what I was hoping to do for <a href="http://firmamentproject.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Fingers on the Firmament</a> (just, y'know, in space).

Once I have six or so sessions under my belt I will want some other folks tyring a campaign, both to test the systems and to see what the appeal is.<br/><br/>Right now the biggest question is pacing... does the secret system give players the right amount of XP yet give them reason to spend a few now and again on other fiction.  Or are they going to look at them and say "gee, I can level twice as fast if I ignore the fiction and just go along for the ride."  It's going to be interesting to see how that is regulated among players since there is a player negotiation component *big evil grin*<br/><br/>Johnathan, you playtest a campaign of my game and I'll playtest a campaign in yours <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> <br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110322/#Comment_110322" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T10:00:18+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 10:00AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>Johnathan, you playtest a campaign of my game and I'll playtest a campaign in yours <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nDeal.
