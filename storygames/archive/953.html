                    In a SG thread I cannot locate, we were talking recently about the events of one game influencing another.  You can imagine this happening between sessions of multiple ongoing games, absolutely.  Another way is to have the output of one short game be the input of another, and together the different games form a whole sequence.  Not a new idea, of course, but here are some thoughts on a possible interface...<br/><br/>So, the game text would define both (1) a sequential series of "acts", each act being its own little game, and (2) some reasonable communication format to use so one game's output can be used as a future game's input.<br/><br/>For example, suppose we have a post-apocalyptic game!  Let's define a few acts:<br/><br/>Act 1 - catastrophe: the events leading up to the apocalypse, immediate aftermath<br/>Act 2 - remnants: discovering what survival means <br/>Act 3 - rebirth: the remnant society on the verge of revolution<br/><br/>So after a group runs through an act, a little post-game sheet is filled out and posted to the game's web site for other groups to use.  This should be simple and fun to do, suitable for doing right at the table after the (last) game.<br/><br/>For our apocalypse game, it might be something which gives the players a chance to turn history into myth, like:<br/><br/>- what was taken as input, and other initial conditions<br/>- the nature of the apocalypse<br/>- important places, things<br/>- name something important that was lost<br/>- name something important that was preserved<br/>- each player writes one sentence about each player character, describing how they are remembered<br/><br/>For example, a group playing Act 1 may do something like:<br/><br/>- We decided on Europe during the Enlightenment.<br/>- Catastrophic, radioactive meteor showers!<br/>- The Black Forest region was an important place because no meteors struck there, the fires somehow never got to it, and it became a safe haven.<br/>- What was lost: Religion.<br/>- What was preserved: A library.<br/>- (And one sample PC's set of sentences...)  Malena Hess slaughtered thousands of helpless people from the east.  Malena Hess left her son to die in the fires of Freiburg.  Malena Hess was the most noble and honorable person I ever knew.<br/><br/>Then, a group who wants to play an Act 2 story can look at all the different Act 1 postings and pick which one to go use.<br/><br/>Also, we can imagine lots of other genres, of course: secret history, Bene Gesserit-type projects spanning the aeons, the history of a special family, place, group, or company.<br/><br/>-Jason                </div>

                            What I find intriguing about the idea is to open up the plain possibility that, while some things may be preserved from game to game, they will be twisted and tweaked a bit, and take on new meanings and significance as the derivative games progress.  So your 'loss of religion' might have been a liberation from ignorance, while the next game could treat it as the crushing abandonment of faith in a higher power -- and that would be fine and acceptable.  But then, I love me the cubism.                        </div>

                            I wonder if this would require that certain 'sockets' be included in each game, so that the follow-on game(s) would be assured of something to link to?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, what if you were blithely playing along your "here comes the apocalypse" game, and the game derailed into "We're all going to die, might as well f***."<br/>
<br/>
When the next game comes along, and is ready to start telling stories of survival, what happens when none of the characters from the first game had any hope or interest in surviving?                        </div>

                            Vax, that's where (for me) the reworking of elements from the prior game comes in.  If you are taking up a character from the prior session, you can have them come to a realization that they do indeed want to survive or even have a little in-game soliloquoy where they explain that they were always working towards survival and their prior actions and statements were, in fact, forwarding that cause, <em>regardless</em> of the prior player's actual intentions.  What is preserved from game to game would be <em>what</em> happened, but not necessarily <em>why</em>.<br><br>This would allow you to, for instance, take the hero of the first game and make him into a villain in the second.  Rather easily, in fact.                        </br></br></div>

                            My IRC Hero Quest game largely works this way. I do "Phases" of play in which whole sets of conflicts come and go and eventually reach a climax. Then when the next phase starts, things change substantially, but people are free to play their characters altered by the situation change, or come up with new ones, etc. <br>
<br>
The old records of play seem to serve just fine to start the new phase. I also play in the same world FTF and PBEM. With occasional cross-over action. Events in one definitely effect events in the other game. <br>
