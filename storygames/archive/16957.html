It's designed for three players<br/>2. There are exactly 12 characters and 9 starting locations<br/>3. New areas on the map are unlocked as the cast of characters changes<br/>4. Characters can only move a certain number of spaces on the map per turn<br/>5. Each player character's destiny is designed by the two other players<br/><br/>The most significant change is that the players will roll to see who wins a conflict: so if there's a verbal altercation, or an attempt to steer a ship through a hurricane, or a knife-fight, two players. High roll wins, and then the winner chooses the Yes card or the No card (depending on which player won). <br/><br/><a href="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/rpgs.html" rel="nofollow">rafaelchandler.com/rpgs.html</a><br/><br/>Click the link to download a free PDF of the game!<br/><br/>Thanks to Matthijs for letting me play with this awesome concept.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385967/#Comment_385967" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T09:47:22+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  9:47AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might think that this is a treasonous perversion of a near-perfect game!

You've managed to come up with some great answers to things that have given me fits trying to figure out when I was looking to make a minis using hack of Archipelago.<br/><br/>I am, naturally, immensely jealous!!!<br/><br/>Some of the stuff I liked:<br/><br/>1) It's a 3 player game.<br/>I read that bit and felt like I'd been smacked between the eyes with the clue bat.  Sheesh! Of course!{bonk! *stars*] I kept running in circles trying to figure out how many people my hack was supposed to work for. Three is a great number that works with some natural dynamics.<br/><br/>2) There are three main characters (PCs) and 9 supporting characters (NPCs) and that's it.<br/>Again, clue-bat time. Really, having some spare characters around to add flavor is a must have. It's important for scenes to work, It's also next to impossible for anyone to follow a cast of millions. Yeah, another bulls-eye. Just enough extra potentially interesting characters to provide interactions and contrasts to the main characters.<br/><br/>2a) I thought the requirement to go with simple names was brilliant.<br/><br/>It also helped me clarify something I was running into problems with: Sometimes extra minis are really just "terrain". I mean, i'd like to do some action packed stuff with soldier-y types, but those things really don't even add up to mooks. Really, they're more scenery that's dangerous than anything else.<br/><br/>3) Dividing the charaters into factions, but those factions can be uneven or even amazingly lopsided and that sets up the story.<br/>Oh hell yes. There are charater minis and a setting, and even a situation, but the players need to be able to decide kinda naturally what the focus is going to be and where their interests lie. Good stuff.<br/><br/>4) The various dice as player resources not in-fiction capabilities of the characters.<br/>I tried something similar in an earlier design attempt and badly bobbled the explanation. You've nailed it.<br/><br/>5) Hvaing the least involved player acting as a temporary referee/ decision maker in contests.<br/>The 3 player nature of the game ties right back into that perfectly.<br/><br/>6) Having 9 locations and ties between them, and movement between them.<br/>I have no idea how I'd translate that to a more minis wargaming style table layout but the idea is great. Less locations than characters means that somone is always interacting somewhere with other key characters, and being able to physically move the pieces uses the play space more naturally than jumping from scene to scene and explaining the space/movement interations by just narration.<br/><br/>7) I liked that you talked about setting set ups beyond just the islands from Matthijs original game.<br/>I was very much struck by your suggestion of a ship as a setting and having locations based on that. The core idea of the map can be seen a whole bunch of different ways. With your use of a big sheet of paper you could even do things like social circles or cliques as conceptual locations, and even make those linked with the more obvious idea of physical locations. Think,  something like a High School drama. On one hand, there's probably a few key physical settings, maybe even with subdividsions. Swirling around that thoug are the cliques that act a whole lot like locations of their own, and may even go beyond simple factions. And all of that is interacting together. On a big sheet to draw a map, you could have both types of things acting as locations.<br/><br/>Jeez I wish i wasn't loacted half a continent away from you guys. I'd love to try this out in person and then have a go at busting out some toys and a table and showing y'all what my take on this would be. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386013/#Comment_386013" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T23:38:15+00:00" title="July 30, 2012 11:38PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read this yesterday and instantly wanted to play it.

So when I read the Archipelago II rules, I interpreted the description of possible locations ("oceans, star clusters, deserts") to mean that you could set this game anywhere, even in outer space.<br/><br/>Your idea of "conceptual locations" is awesome!

It was actually a reverse engineering from a couple different little-thoughts where the physical space was important, but so were social groupings beyond obvious factions ( one was a WW2 Resistance thing and the other was an Election Season for Monsters dealie) and those social groupings could morph in their membership (which is part of the drama of play).<br/><br/>Also, when I woke up this morning, I figured out how to make the connections as spaces concept (and creating/naming) spaces thing work with a "wargame" style physical table layout and keep the aesthetic feel. I have to work on the props, but basically just use small, genre appropriate, intersection sign posts for the connections between locations, and when charater minis are in transit, lace them within about a handspan of the sign. Locations, as they're chosen as important get some second sort of sign, again something that looks genre appropriate, but what that means can vary based on tastes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386135/#Comment_386135" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T07:35:36+00:00" title="August  1, 2012  7:35AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Rafael, I had a couple quick questions and was also wondering if you might give some opinions on how I could hack this for use with a big minis table layout rather than a posterboard board.<br/><br/>First, I'm not clear on whether connections count as a space for movement of miniatures, or just the locations. The way I read it at first, it could be either one. Then I thought about it more and began to suspect that the connections just act as a way to show locations were adjacent/accesssible to one another. Which is the way you play?<br/><br/>When you added connections later, did players describe that connector in some fashion or why it began to become important? Like, err, I dunno saying there was a smugglers' route bewteen islands or whatever, or maybe a secret passage or unused ductwork or something? Or friendly giant eagles came into play?<br/><br/>I'm running into a problem figuring out how to work something on the tabletop, and it regards "other minis", stuff that isn't really core PCs/NPCs but would simply be what I call more like backdrop stuff. The kinds of characters that would be extras in a film or maybe just described in a sentence or two in Grail Epoch. Like say, a few pirate crewmen assumed to be around with the NPC Black Bart most of the time unless otherwise noted. How would you personally go about using that kind of stuff on a big table set up?<br/><br/>Last, are there any kind folks with some of those very basic computer skills (which i sadly don't have) that could create a sort of printable playmatand location/connection markers for a big minis table version of this? I'm imagining a landscape oriented single sheet with boxes for the PCs and NPCs and their info to be written in, and also perhaps a an area to hold used cards and dice on either side of the character boxes. For locations, just a simple cool looking square big enough to write the basic name in and maybe a little color info. For connections, perhaps just a double-ended arrow, again big enough to write a color title and the endpoints.<br/><br/>Yes, i know that's a bit greedy of me, but it would aid me a whole bunch and I suspect there are a whole bunch of folks here who could whip something like that up in a few minutes. it might take me days just to figure out the beginnings of how-to DIY it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386136/#Comment_386136" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T07:49:02+00:00" title="August  1, 2012  7:49AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Komradebob!<br/><br/>Right, so the connections do not count as a space. They're just lines that connect spaces, so that you know which spaces you can move to from a given location.<br/><br/>Yeah, when we added connections, we found a way to justify it (someone's dug a tunnel, a collapsed tree has created a makeshift bridge across a canyon, et cetera). Your ideas are kickass -- secret passages, smugglers' routes, all that. Great stuff.<br/><br/>I think your idea for 'extras' is a great one. Mechanically, I'd say they're just there -- easily moved around whenever necessary, not named or capable of actions. In a regular game of Archipelago, you'd just handwave it away -- "There's a crowd watching as you battle in the streets" -- but with minis, you could actually show the crowd, as needed. Could definitely make for a more fun experience.<br/><br/>I play this game with a posterboard, but I've been meaning to do a proper job -- I've got this eight-foot table that I have to assemble, along with a few dozen structures (buildings, towers, a painted mural background), and I'd like to run a game of A Grail Epoch using that setup sometime. I'll let you know how it goes!<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm working on a printable playmat. I'm trying to make it fairly modular, so you can move locations and connections around to create a custom map. The setup you describe is perfect!<br/><br/>I'll let you know if I make any progress on that front anytime soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386146/#Comment_386146" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-01T11:15:32+00:00" title="August  1, 2012 11:15AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't had a chance to really dig through the rules yet.

It's an isolation thing on one hand and a focus thing on the other.<br/><br/>What i'm getting at is that the initial round of scenes is really very important, and that a moving location should be fine, provided it doesn't stomp on anyone's ability to spotlight a bit and isolate scenes if that's where they want to go with things.<br/><br/>[Anyway,for tabletop layouts, it might be just as useful to declare anti-connections/blockages or even double cost moves. Or maybe just come up with some practical SOP, like wherever a location marker is placed defines the center of the location and location centers are somewhere between 8" and 24" apart with physical visual indicators of rough boundaries. At that point, really just use common sense and roll off conflicting ideas/draw cards just like anything else. And, ya know, talk to each other a little about intent.]<br/><br/>BTW, has anyone else considered doing a re-assessment after those initial round of scenes? I ask because a couple of times playing Archipelago I've found that the initial choice of either element or PC was not really as interesting as something else that was developing, like an interesting NPC that had blossomed through play or an unexpected element was needing some guardianship, while an earlier chosen one really didn't because everyone was actually already on thr same page with that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386202/#Comment_386202" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T07:42:19+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  7:42AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, you've nailed it. The other thing to consider is that, over time, the spotlight intensifies. NPCs are disposable -- they exist to provide conflict, illumination, and opportunity. But as the game progresses, it's inevitable that some of those NPCs are going to withdraw from the narrative, leaving the core cast -- the main characters -- on the screen to face their destinies. <br/><br/>To make that easier, you create additional connections. And maybe you have locations that are accessible from new places -- like a ship that suddenly can travel throughout all of the islands, effectively granting teleportation abilities to characters. This makes it possible to reach new locations quickly during those final rounds, which can facilitate cool storytelling without making it tedious ("I'd like to have a scene at the Dragon's Lair, because it would be cool to have him face his nemesis, but it's five locations away, so I guess we'll do a scene here, and then next time it's my turn, I'll be able to go there..."). <br/><br/>Early on, the limitations of location and connection force all characters into a small group of spaces, resulting in repeated interaction and conflict, but probably with a slightly different cast of characters in each scene. Later in the game, you want to open things up, make it possible for the last remaining characters to hammer it out and face destiny -- and a moving location sounds like an awesome way to do that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386207/#Comment_386207" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-02T08:25:11+00:00" title="August  2, 2012  8:25AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2012 8:27AM by komradebob.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess part of it comes down to whether the vehicle (or whatever) is actually a location in itself or just a connection doesn't it?<br/><br/>I mean, The Millenium Falcon or a circus caravan are both locations that can move but also have a whole lot to offer in themselves for scenes.<br/><br/>It's undoubtedly overcomplicating things in a straight forward game, but maybe if a vehicle ( or equivalent) is going to do that double duty in a game, it starts with two "Ports of call"* and then an additional one can be added after any scene that takes place in the vehicle (or involves that vehicle in an important fashion). The vehicle is then either "at sea/in space/on the road" or can be moved to one of its ports of call. When it moves into a port of call, that's the only connection it has at the time.<br/><br/>No, I don't have brilliant ideas about how it would work when multiple locationvehicles interact in at-sea situations either.<br/><br/>*edited to add:<br/>Or just one port of call and an open slot, to be decided the first time it comes up.
