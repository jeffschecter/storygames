The aim is to see how I'm doing with respect to those things, and thereby know what to focus on next time.\n<h1>Context</h1>\nThere's a good few systems now which have a post-session checklist which implicitly asks "did we have a good session?". BW does this pretty well with its Artha awards; these are per-player, but they reflect on everyone (if a PC didn't progress on any of their goals, quite likely the GM or other players didn't do enough to enable that). Dungeon World also does this, with a checklist for the whole group:\n<blockquote> "\u2022 Did we learn something new and important about the world?<br/>\u2022 Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?<br/>\u2022 Did we loot a memorable treasure?"</blockquote>\n(each "yes" nets each player an XP award)<br/><br/>The meta-question of the three is "Did exciting fantasy adventure go down this session?"\ufeff If none of them are true, and the session felt a bit flat, then you've got a candidate diagnosis right there.<br/>\n<h1>My Idea</h1>\nI'm looking to make a post-session checklist something like this:\n<ul>\n<li>Everyone got excited at least some of the time (preferably, everybody together)</li>\n<li>Everybody's character stories progressed</li>\n<li>The world beyond the characters develops in some way</li>\n<li>Every player contributed something</li>\n<li>The GM gave away enough info for the game style we're supposed to be playing </li>\n<li>I learned something new about GMing</li>\n<li>I got new insight into how the mechanics of this game/style work</li>\n<li>We applied the rules consistently, as written</li>\n</ul>\n(this is just an illustrative example - those are relevant things, but this is not its final form)<br/><br/>This will be something I fill in myself, privately - I'm not proposing a group checklist here. I'll probably set a target of, say, "4 of 8" to qualify as a "good session" - that's rather arbitrary but it gives me a goal. Importantly, by not aiming for 100% I can make the list richer, and include e.g. two items that are hard to hit in the same session as each other. It thus defines a space of "good sessions", rather than a single form for one.<br/><br/>I don't expect to make one master list that will do for every game; every GM will do best to make their own, and change it over time as their goals and abilities change. In particular, if you're hitting 100% regularly then your checklist's probably not doing much to help you. Between play styles, the list could vary a lot (for example, look at the above list from an OSR perspective - at least three are irrelevant or just plain wrong).<br/><br/>Entries can be end goals (e.g. "everybody got excited at some point") or a means to an end ("we applied the rules consistently").                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437543/#Comment_437543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-20T09:10:00+00:00" title="August 20, 2014  9:10AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>tl;dr</b> - I'm collecting a list of distinct ways in which an RPG session could be deemed "good".

But when I do DM, here\u2019s my goal.<br/>I have only two things on my ideal checklist when I DM.<br/><br/>I see them as things that could be seen as contradictory, but want to balance them or bring a synthesis between them.<br/><br/><b>1. The DM should talk less than the players</b><br/><br/>This means that there should be a dialog, prompts, questions \u2014 I can describe things, but that\u2019s if they ask. If they don\u2019t, I have to choose my words carefully. Like maybe the smell is more important than the color of the wallpaper \u2014 I don\u2019t get both. Brevity is the soul here. (Then if they ASK about the wallpaper, I answer. Dialogue. I should be their ears and eyes, not boring museum guide.) If I can say something poetically in a few minutes or casually in five words, I choose the five words.<br/><br/>Example time: I often watch games on YouTube where the DM rambles on and on. Sometimes for like 15 minutes and the players only get to a little input here and there and then its time for a new DM monologue. And those DMs often get high marks and are very appreciated. But it\u2019s not my style. The DMs I have appreciated the most have been brief and play has been driven by the players. They answer the players prompts, they ask the players questions and they answer the players\u2019 questions.<br/><br/><b>2. The players should always have concrete options</b><br/><br/>If they hesitate at \u201cwhat do you do\u201d, I try to give them concrete options. \u201cYou can go forward, or to the left, or back again. Or you can do something else.\u201d If they can\u2019t decide, I add pressure \u2014 perhaps wandering monsters come. Or something else. Or I help them decide, give more info, remind them what they know.<br/><br/>Example time: So generally my experiences with Fate and Diaspora have been a little unsatisfying \u2014 not bad, but not amazing either, and sometimes a little wonky. But one thing happened in Diaspora once where the players were, as they are wont to do, arguing in character about what to do. In my olden days I would\u2019ve been happy to just sit and listen to this \u2014 and that\u2019s a common advice I still often hear DMs recieved. But since I had the shiny new toy that Diaspora was to me at the time, I asked them \u201cAre you guys having fun with this?\u201d And to my surprise, because I could never have read this, they said \u201cNo. We are frustrated\u201d and we played out their debate with the tools the game provided instead, and they became happy.<br/><br/>Another example time: Once I was a player in a 1890\u2019s Call of Cthulhu game and we were like stuck in the PC\u2019s house for hours and we did nothing. I and another player made our own fun acting out a love affair through passed notes. But our options were not clear. I guess it was some sort of puzzle, that the GM had some outcome in mind that we could not figure out. We just sat in our house and waited for something to happen.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So to me it seems somewhat contradictory that the players should drive the action, that the DM should get out of the way, while at the same time the DM should make sure that the choices are clear and to facilitate player\u2019s decisions, making sure everyone is heard.<br/><br/>Both of these things are super hard. That\u2019s why I only want these two, for now, on my checklist.<br/><br/><small>But I have also pasted a lot of \u201cmini-checklists\u201d into my scenario book for points I want to mention. For example, one has \u201cHigh ceilings, dank air, dark, silent\u201d. I don\u2019t want to rattle off all four in a single description but I want, ideally, all four to have been mentioned at one time or another at this location. It\u2019s fine if it doesn\u2019t happen of course. It\u2019s just a tool to make it more varied.</small><br/><br/>I\u2019m also not convinced that these two things are good, or that this DM-ing style is actually any good! But that\u2019s why I want to make a conscious effort to do these two things \u2014 to get me data so I can evolve as a DM, either do the two things better or start doing the opposite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437720/#Comment_437720" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T13:56:59+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  1:56PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be back here with Double Cross' list.
