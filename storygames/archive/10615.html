So, you can get on with coming up with great content for the game both before and during play. Like the Town stuff in Dogs but somehow so much more organic and useful. It works in such a way that you never really have those moments of uncertainty in GMing, yet there is no railroad or plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first session ended when I had run out of good apocalypica to barf, had established everyone's character and had identified at least one possible threat/front/grief/issue for each of the characters. The last bit was wicked easy, synthetic and really spoke to each of the players. I never had to reign in anyone about tone or gonzo-ness because the playbooks and the barfing set it up in clear and inspiring way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFronts. Man. Fucking perfect. Prior to this, I'd either be playing Dogs, or some variation, and use the Town rules; or I'd be running some other game and use the situation creation rules out of Unknown Armies. Like, with the relationship maps and writing until shit was heavy. But Fronts. Fronts are what I've been dreaming about all these years. Simple, practical tools to keep the game moving and interesting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235333/#Comment_235333" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T23:17:42+00:00" title="October  2, 2009 11:17PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you go into a little more detail about what Fronts are and how they function?

Like, character creation for the GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen for the second session onwards, you fill out these sheets that represent your fronts. Like, the Western Front, or like "man, I'm taking it on three fronts right now!"<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, front are comprised of a few things. "A front is a set of linked threats." Firstly, a basic scarcity that represents the the front: like, envy or fear or hunger. You set the stakes for the front, like in Trollbabe, outline who's involved. Then you build a a couple of threats, which have their own moves and types. Then you give them a in-fiction description, a cast, a custom move and a countdown. The countdown represents five or less basic stages that the front and the threats will progress in if left alone. And that's it. Simple and pretty obvious but super useful on a moment to moment basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you a have like three or four Front for the group, so that whenever there's a lull in the game just look at these sheets and you now the who and the what and the how and the when. The countdown timers help alot to pace and co-ordinate the various fronts. The stakes of the Fronts are the real interesting part, because that's where you, as the GM, get to ask questions. Will Pallor survive the Sisterhood? What's does Hannah's freedom cost? That sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really admire about the game isn't that it's innovative. It's really not. It's more that it very, very clearly sets out procedurally, what you have to do as a GM. Fronts are the procedure by which to do your prep. If you follow the rules/advice in the in the book,, you'll have enough 'sets of linked threats' that there'll never be a dull moment in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235343/#Comment_235343" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-03T03:20:08+00:00" title="October  3, 2009  3:20AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fronts are great. <br><br>What is the GM advice these days?
