It was Trey, Ben, Ping, and Phil, with me GMing. We talked about the game A LOT both during and after. I\u2019m going to try to intersperse some of our thoughts. Hopefully the others will pitch in their thoughts and add some coherency.<br/><br/>The Psi Runners step out of a mangled shipping container on a high overpass at rush hour near a port city surrounded by mountains. At this point they\u2019re nobody. Players are Trey, Ben, Ping, and Phil. <br/><br/>Some blue uniformed \u201csecurity guard\u201d guys are coming up the ramp. Already we\u2019re having a bit of trouble with co-operative action. Who\u2019s actually involved in getting past the security guards?  The runners are clearly a team of some sort, but there\u2019s no way for them to help one another or act as a group.  The rules force them to act as individuals.<br/><br/>Trey and Phil are taking the most over actions so we have them roll. And then I blunder a bit. I have them roll one after another, but Trey\u2019s narration takes away Phil\u2019s goal because they\u2019re both trying to get past the security guards. <br/><br/>We eventually figure out that it\u2019s best for people acting together to roll together and interweave the relevant bits of narration. Also, it works best if characters have goals that aren\u2019t exclusive. <br/><br/>Later we\u2019re hiding in a culvert, trying to convince some homeless people to help us. Trey has already established through memory that he had something to do with experimenting on the other PCs. He\u2019s a doctor in some kind of secret project, but a power play by a rival landed him in the same situation as his one-time victims. The problem is that this sets up a kind of intra-PC tension that the game doesn\u2019t support. Now PCs are pulling in different directions, but there\u2019s not rules way for them to resolve it. I think the solution is just for them to run in different directions, but the players want to stay in a group.<br/><br/>Cops show up, mayhem ensues, PCs flee. As far as I can tell, I\u2019m supposed to use the threat of capture as a hammer to keep the PCs moving and off balance. It\u2019s sort of working, but something is missing. <br/><br/>We decide that the PCs need to get a goal that\u2019s bigger than \u201cGM introduces threat, PCs run from threat.\u201d What I think is that the PCs are supposed to find these goals through their memory narration. So Trey has a memory of a secret lab near the waterfront that they can now check out. I toss in some narration of him finding his ID badge in the lab coat. This cements play with a direction.<br/><br/>Clues are very important in transitioning from headlong flight into some kind of structured story. Maybe the rules should actually tell the GM to drop some clues early on. On the other hand, maybe the players need to attend to this when they\u2019re framing their questions. If we specifically call out the questions as a source of clues, that might tip off the players about how to use their narration.<br/><br/>Our final scene is in the diner across from the mysterious \u201cAlexander building\u201d, home of the mysterious lab. The players want more intra-PC conflict because the PCs don\u2019t trust one another. We try to figure this out for a long time. Finally we decide to do it with simultaneous rolls where the PCs have goals that aren\u2019t exclusive. Trey wants to get away from this group, whom he fears will discover who he is. Ping wants to get information out f Trey. Both succeed, and we get a memory where we discover that Trey has developed Psi powers because of exposure to Ping\u2019s abilities, which gives Trey a reason to throw in with the runners. The conflict also brings the chasers into the scene.<br/><br/>We have a cool scene with chasers being swatted by cars that Ben is throwing around with his telekinetic powers. Unfortunately, the chasers have no mechanical effect that I can find in our version of the rules. This makes them feel a bit hollow as a threat. We talk over some ideas for this. What if having the chasers in the scene imposed a penalty die on the runners? Or what if you rolled an extra die in a scene with chasers, but you also had an extra box to put a die on, with attendant possible bad things to happen to you?<br/><br/>Ben has a memory where it is established that if he wants he can move the moon.<br/><br/>The scene ends with Phil walking out of the mayhem and into the Alexander building, where he has a memory that reveals his own father, the head of the conspiracy, handed him over for experimentation.<br/><br/>I\u2019m focusing on the difficult parts here. The game was quite fun and has quite a few nice subtleties to drive the action. Here are a few more thoughts from my notes:<br/><br/>Four players seems like a lot for Psi Run. Five would be pushing it hard.<br/>We each made a cheat sheet of one another\u2019s questions. This was VERY helpful.<br/>We had a lot of stalling problems. The runners spent a lot of time talking rather than doing stuff. This started to go away after we established some clues.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125617/#Comment_125617" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T15:50:12+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  3:50PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should say first that Tony was the only one of us who'd actually read the rules, the rest of us were being introduced to the game through this playtest session. However, doing some checking of the rules myself during our game did not answer our pressing questions.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the game was that it offered only one direction for the players: "run away". Run away from the crash, run away from the Chasers, run away... to what end? Obviously recovering memories is meant to be an important part of establishing goals and directions for the players, but early on that just meant a lot of arguing back and forth, both in character and out, among the players about what to do. Tony made some effort to apply pressure on us so that we'd be forced to take action - which means rolling dice, which means opportunities to recover memories and generate direction - but still it was too easy to just keep talking and disagreeing, and worse, to have a series of scenes that amounted to a bunch of clueless people talking and arguing about what to do, and then fleeing from the cops. That killed a lot of my interest in the game. <br/><br/>I do appreciate that the lack of direction lets the players push for ideas they're interested in, and allows for creative development of the setting and color. The Alexander Building came out of one of my questions, "Who is Alexander?", which I came up with after Tony was talking about someone named Alexander for some reason. However, overall the lack of "handles" in the system, obvious ways to manipulate the game, made it difficult for us to move things forward.<br/><br/>Also, as Tony mentioned, the Chasers turned out to be a hollow threat. I had had the impression that the Chasers were a pacing mechanism, and when they caught up to the Runners that triggered the endgame. But no, they just... showed up. They had no effect on getting questions answered, they didn't increase the danger for the Runners, they were just there. Tony had the Chasers as a special threat distinct from the ordinary cops and guards, but I'm not sure if the game actually says the Chasers are meant to have special significance. It seemed to be easy to keep the Chasers at a distance; when they showed up in our final scene, it was because we decided that we wanted them to appear, not because some mishap caused them to catch up. That left us asking what was the point.<br/><br/>I'd say the game needs to make the Chasers more of a direct, tangible threat, to encourage the Runners to work together and to give them more direction in what to do. It also needs more guidance on handling conflict between the Runners. Finally, all that needs to tie back into answering questions. Right now, there's not much impetus to care about the characters or their questions, and there needs to be something to bring that out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125649/#Comment_125649" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T19:29:10+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  7:29PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the chasers are a specific threat.

Nothing "bad" happened as a result of rolling. I think this is in part because the only mechanical downside to any of the rolls is Harm. Phil and Tony both mentioned we couldn't find any penalty to the Chasers catching with us and there's little downside and no mechanical penalty for bad Psi rolls and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">maybe</span> it's <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">even</span> in genre to have your psi powers unleash, go crazy and kill people. For Reveal, on 6, I get to narrate the memory, on a 4-5, another player does, either way I get a memory 50% of the time. Maybe I'd rather say what that memory is, but honestly, I found that my fellow players' ideas were really good too.  Is there some competitive piece to Reveal that we missed?  Goal has a 50% chance of success too. Given all this, what's to keep players from just sticking their lower dice on Chase and Psi and having pretty good odds (especially when you get to discard the lowest die) with the rest of the other dice to succeed on Goal, get a memory and take no Harm just about every time?<br/><br/>By the end of the game, I think we started to wonder if the intention of the game is to be competitive where you are trying to answer your questions at the expense of others answering theirs.  We suspected this was the case, but we weren't sure how the game was set up to reflect that.<br/><br/>[edited with strikeout]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125796/#Comment_125796" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-11T11:08:44+00:00" title="February 11, 2008 11:08AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2008 11:09AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will say that lacking a clear sense of how the game was supposed to work, we did what all good gamers everywhere do: we made our own fun. While the game mechanics had problems, I think we had a pretty good time just coming up with memories and wedging them into the accumulated reality.<br/><br/>Trey had a really interesting character development early as Tony mentioned: he used to be a doctor experimenting on us, not a normal patient. I was actually really pleased with exploring that idea and watching his character develop rather than pushing my own character. It created a lot of in-character friction, but I think that was good and helped the mood of paranoid flight.<br/><br/>The really amusing part to me is that IIRC it all started because we grabbed a bunch of Lego figures to represent our characters, and the one he grabbed had a stethoscope, which led to him deciding to put "how much do I know about medicine" as one of his questions. He also decided he was actually wearing a stethoscope, which if you think about it changes everything: no prisoner would be wearing a stethoscope (I think that's the order of events, but Trey correct me if I'm wrong). It pretty much mandates that right before the crash he was still working for Them. Which was, as I said, awesome.<br/><br/>On the other hand pretty much nothing was happening with Phil's character. He got to zap some things, but there was no character development until the very end where we stuck him with the memory of his Dad running the Them operation and sacrificing him for medical experiments. Ping got some cool memories that interwove with Trey's story, which was very cool, but the net result was pretty lopsided.<br/><br/>Like the other players I haven't seen the rules, but pretty much what everyone else said as far as missing links. The rules may or may not address them, but it was unclear to us:<br/><br/>- What are the limits of narrative control: when I narrate a memory, how much do I define the world? Can I remember things about others? Can I remember things that define the Chasers? If the players know they can just make up facts to resolve the mystery of who is after them, where to go, etc that works, but otherwise the GM needs to include some kind of clues to move things along (like the ID badge we retconned into Trey's pocket).<br/><br/>- Chasers need a mechanical effect to make their presence threatening. If I'm using dice to keep them away there should be a reason.<br/><br/>- How does group conflict resolution work? Since our dice are separate, how do we cooperate to achieve a goal?<br/><br/>Definitely not enough dice pressure -- as others said, it was too easy to get pretty much everything you wanted with a roll.<br/><br/>There also seems to be a potential spotlight problem in that in early scenes it really only takes one character using funky powers to resolve the scene ("your TK shockwave slams all the police to the ground, done") so when everyone declares action with different powers it gets chaotic and less appealing fast. Mostly a problem in the early stage, where the very existence of powers is just being revealed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126913/#Comment_126913" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T13:01:46+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  1:01PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just played this last night (an AP post is coming from the GM) and it seems that you guys must have rolled a lot better than us!<br/><br/>We all came out with multiple "hurt for a session" wounds, Two of use got captured by the Chasers, and dozens of innocent bystanders died in Wild surges.I only had one or two rolls where everything came out as I wanted (4+ reveal, 4+ chase (or 5+(?) capture), 3+ harm, 4+ success, 3+ psi, discard low).

Since the designers haven't responded, I'm looking at a few ideas of my own.<br/><br/>Because Psi Run is heavily based on Otherkind, I went back to that game to look for some mechanical bits that might help.  I see two right off the bat that I think could be influential.\n<blockquote><b>Rolling Together:</b> If you and another PC are facing the same enemy to reach the same goal, you can roll together. Roll 4 Basic Dice, plus your Color Dice if you're using any, plus your friend's Color Dice if she's using any, plus one more die because you're working together. You must quickly agree how to assign the dice; if you can't, the GM should step in and assign them for you. (If you can agree which dice to discard, the GM should respect that agreement.) If your enemy has Iron, either or both of you can contribute the Radiance to counter it.  You can follow the pattern to include even more PCs in a roll: each PC contributes her Color Dice, plus one more for her simple participation, plus whatever Radiance she chooses. You all must quickly agree how to assign the dice.</blockquote>\nCombining rolls for cooperating Runners seems like it would work just fine.  Since you automatically get an extra die in PsiRun, I'm not sure if I'd give the extra "helping die" described here or not.  I also might make them choose which character recovers a memory, if I was worried about the pace of the game increasing too much.\n<blockquote><b>Iron and Radiance:</b>  When you're fighting people with Iron, after you've assigned your dice, the GM subtracts points equal to your enemies' Iron from one of your dice. She can choose either your Motion die or your Safety die.  For example, say the hulking giant from our ongoing example has an Iron of 2, and the GM uses it to subtract 2 from my Safety die. Now my result is Narration 4 Motion 5 Life 2 Safety 4. I narrate that in his death throes, he throws me and I fall heavily, spraining an ankle.</blockquote>\nGiving the Chasers something like Iron (Anti-Psi maybe?) could dramatically increase their ability to be a threat.  I would probably start them off with 1 and then increase it by 1 each time the Chasers show up in a scene.  If I were to limit the effects of Anti-Psi to two categories (as above) they would be Goal and Harm.<br/><br/>I'm unsure if I'll throw these in from the start, since I should probably playtest the game as it is before adding variations/drift, but if someone who played it before could chime in and let me know if they think these would improve the game significantly, then I may go ahead and try them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137678/#Comment_137678" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T11:00:13+00:00" title="April  2, 2008 11:00AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty interesting.
