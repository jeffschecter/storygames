A failure need not represent an individual's inability, but rather a heretofore unknown circumstance that arises. Failed to sneak by the guard? It turns out he was only pretending to be asleep to lure you into a false sense of security! Failed to convince the noble to pay you a bit more for that dragon-slaying job? His reserves of gold are low because the dragon's been eating his tax collectors!<br/><br/>This is rather rudimentary to most of the SG community, I'm sure.<br/><br/>Further meditations on the nature of the dice roll have impressed to me other, more abstract interpretations of the dice. The dice are little oracles that are cast to foretell the truth of an undertaking. Someone proposes something to be true, and there is uncertainty. The dice are thrown and the rules consulted, as if casting a handful of sticks and consulting the <i>I Ching</i>. Or, more crudely, you say what you want to be true and shake the Magic 8-Ball to see what it thinks of the matter.<br/><br/>It always comes back to the reaction roll for me. 2d6 with three outcomes (initially): negative, neutral, positive. The striking similarity to PbtA mechanics is noted, but it does something that PbtA does not: it demands players and GM relinquish their power and rely entirely on the dice. Except there's one caveat: the Charisma bonus. Charisma bonus applies to the roll, meaning that charismatic characters are more likely to encounter hospitable monsters. The reaction roll determines an encounter, but the PC's abilities influence the reaction roll--and thus place a finger on the scales of the fictional universe.<br/><br/>Applying this mechanic more broadly, one could easily generate three outcomes for any die roll: yes, no, maybe. The player proposes something to be true, and the dice are cast alongside the appropriate ability, and the truth of that matter is determined by the dice roll...which of course represents circumstance, fortune, and skill. And a PC being particularly skilled at something (<i>having a high modifier</i> in the D&amp;D parlance) allows them to influence the universe, gently nudging it to make circumstance and fortune agree with his desires.<br/><br/>In practice:<br/><br/>Yes, no, maybe only works some of the time for some of the questions. A "maybe" is not a very compelling answer. Naturally, in the age of PbtA, the "maybe" becomes "yes, but not exactly," or "not quite what you wanted, but not quite what you didn't want."<br/><br/>I'm going on at length, but certain mechanical extrapolations of this are coming to me as I type.<br/><br/>PLAYER: "I kill the orc."<br/>DM: "Do you? Roll the dice."<br/><br/>Yes, the orc is dead. No, the orc is not dead (and he's mad). Maybe he's not dead but he's wounded.<br/><br/>That's the most obvious application within the most beloved murderhobo simulator, but what about something different.<br/><br/>PLAYER: "The orcs are asleep."<br/>DM: "They might be. Roll the dice."<br/><br/>Yes, the orcs are asleep, or no, they're not. Or maybe most of them are asleep, but there's a lone sentry who is awake, or perhaps they're all dozing.<br/><br/>Extrapolating further: touching on Fate's mechanics. The above exchange would be likely a Create An Advantage roll. Oh, yeah, the orcs are asleep, so you get a free +2 to whatever you're trying to do. This yes/no/maybe-kinda-sorta roll could very well work within a similar context.<br/><br/>Are the orcs asleep? Roll a d20 and add to it whatever. On a yes, they're asleep, which gives you an advantage. On a no, they're not asleep, and in fact are alert, which gives you a disadvantage. On a maybe, some are asleep and some are alert, which opens an opportunity for you: you have a strong advantage against some and a disadvantage against others. How can you make use of this? Apply dice bonuses and penalties as you see fit.<br/><br/>Pushing this idea further, what if the die roll set the entire scene, and players could then influence the roll with their own rolls to make it more favorable (or unfavorable)? Roll the "reaction roll" for the orcs. Oh, well, it would seem that the circumstances are against you, initially. But you can try to improve them. A Charisma roll might allow you to propose something like, "These orcs are well-fed, and their bloodlust is sated" (you're influencing their mood, so it's Charisma for the purposes of this example). A roll of yes/no/maybe-kinda-sorta determines this, and if the answer is no, we treat it as a 6- (escalation).<br/><br/>Forgive my long-winded rambling on this matter, but as a final note, I've already begun experimenting with this in my 5e game. Instead of reaction rolls, I have whomever is leading the party roll his Persuasion check to determine a monster's reaction. It has worked well thus far. Recently, I had a player ransack a weapons locker and say he wanted to find a magic item. Was there a magic item stowed away there? Oh, it was certainly a possibility given the circumstances. I hadn't planned it, but I allowed him to declare what he wanted to find and roll Investigate to discover a minor magical sword. (Why not?)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin" title="Aaron_Griffin"><img alt="Aaron_Griffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/469/nQL6632G2O226.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin">Aaron_Griffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479348/#Comment_479348" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-28T16:20:52+00:00" title="December 28, 2018  4:20PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This feels a bit like some of the advice in Trollbabe - where the conflict/roll to determine if they can spot anyone sneaking in the woods defines whether or not there is someone sneaking in the woods.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479349/#Comment_479349" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-28T16:23:01+00:00" title="December 28, 2018  4:23PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2018 4:37PM by DeReel.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here, the roll gives you an information poor, abstract answer.

I'd maybe say those are all the modifiers, too. If circumstances matter, that's a modifier, sometimes affected by player skill. If fortune matters, and it always does, that's a modifier (the dice), and in rare cases like "blessing of the gods", might be a + or - too. And of course if skill matters, that's a modifier.<br/><br/>So then, is there a magic item? Circumstance might matter. Fortune matters.

It's pretty simple, where a character is either able to lift the stone or can't lift the stone, but also where weaker characters shouldn't be able to lift the stone if a stronger character can't.<br/><br/>So a die roll can't be applicable to that kind of situation, and instead the game master (or adventure creator) should determine a minimum value (a <i>difficulty</i>) to be able to lift the stone. So why not extend this, and let Sneak rolls be at a certain difficulty instead? Because either they can sneak past the guard, or they can't.<br/><br/>So what makes the die roll even mean, if it can be replaced by the game master to just make up values that a skill of the whole party need to match up to?<br/><br/>That's when I started to game master differently, where I made up explanations why a roll didn't succeed, or the players made up why a skill roll succeeded. Perhaps there were wines that helped the character climb a wall, or there were security guards noticing the character when they passed the wall? Because the roll is just a difficulty made up for the whole party, which \u2013 in a way \u2013 means that rolling separate rolls for each character is just defeating the "purpose" of the roll: to determine how hard the situation really is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris" title="ericvulgaris"><img alt="ericvulgaris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nJV8DKZOO3TSE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris">ericvulgaris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479371/#Comment_479371" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-29T19:32:33+00:00" title="December 29, 2018  7:32PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This reminds me a lot of like a burning wheel wises.

Is she willing to help us?"<br/><br/>Perhaps I decide that, by default, the Priestesses are skeptical but could be bought with money, power, or favours, or won over with strong emotional appeals.<br/><br/>I roll:<br/><br/>[0], [+]<br/><br/>The first die tells me that is she skeptical but could be won over - no surprises here.<br/><br/>But the second die tells me there is some good news, as well: perhaps she holds a grudge against our enemies, and that might mean something going forward.<br/><br/>I'm also quite fond of the diceless "oracle" I used in my game "As the Worm Turns", which accomplishes this quite well without any random elements (but requires three players):<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19960/as-the-worm-turns-live-open-playtest-formerly-backseat-adventures/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19960/as-the-worm-turns-live-open-playtest-formerly-backseat-adventures/p1</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479374/#Comment_479374" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-29T19:55:35+00:00" title="December 29, 2018  7:55PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also an old game (or game aid, perhaps) that's entirely about this, called "Mythic".

Before you can even get to "the orcs are asleep," you need there to <i>be orcs in the first place</i>. What's the scenario that caused you to encounter orcs and for their wakefulness to matter? And, this might sound silly, but is crucial: why didn't the fortune roll determine all of that, too? Or, hell, <b>did</b> it?<br/><br/>If you can use a roll to locally determine that specific orcs are asleep, can there be a roll that determines whether or not ANY orcs EVER sleep? You're playing with a lot of pre-determined fiction, so how does that differ from the fiction you agree should be up to the roll of the dice?<br/><br/>Those might sound like rhetorical questions, but they aren't. The answers are going to vary by player and game - sometimes subtly, sometimes blatantly. But I suspect the system relevance and power of such rolls will be clarified by those answers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
