Forge Theory also influenced me a lot, in the early days of GLASS design (is that "non-gaming"?)--it got me designing from the perspective of what I wanted to see in play, rather than from a "well, ya gotta have Effect X or Ability Y because you gotta!" perspective. A couple of posters at The Forge, in particular, helped me flip modes and design the possible, rather than the assumed (best example: "middle school drama clubs don't do Peter Pan" = don't include abilities that can't even kind of be simulated in LARP, like flight).<br/><br/>As far as play, I'm probably most influenced by whatever I happen to be reading at the time. For instance, I was reading a lot of Iain Banks' Culture novels, and that got me jazzed to play sci fi. But I'm most influenced (again) by the games that came out mid- to late-2000s, even if I'm not playing one of them (e.g., opening with Kickers, <i>in media res</i>).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381219/#Comment_381219" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T11:04:06+00:00" title="June  7, 2012 11:04AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Impro (Keith Johnstone's books).<br/>Ritual.<br/>Theatre (especially Ibsen, and artsy small intimate plays).<br/>Augusto Boal, although I'm not quite that brave (yet?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381234/#Comment_381234" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T12:22:14+00:00" title="June  7, 2012 12:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A shitload of commentary tracks on movies and TV shows.<br/><br/>Todd Alcott's blog about <a href="http://www.toddalcott.com/" rel="nofollow">What The Protagonist Wants</a><br/><br/>Especially the Venture Brothers reviews.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381499/#Comment_381499" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T17:01:58+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  5:01PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, for me it's working in reverse as I'm looking to gaming to influence theatrical work (we should really draw a map of where this play is taking place, hey,<i> On Mighty Thews</i> has a great way of doing that).

I became much more focused on cutting through all the non-critical setting, the fluffy bits (like the width of a corridor) that don't really deliver emotional weight (though I can see how in a tactical game, that kind of detail would be critical; it's just not something that comes up in the games that I design or play).<br/><br/>In the same way that I skip many cut scenes because they're emotionless info-dumps, I learned to slice away everything that didn't deliver an emotional experience of some kind: affection, Schadenfreude, amusement, anxiety, jealousy, anticipation, and so on.<br/><br/>Video game design also changed the way that I approached scenario design: with both Dread and Spite, I zoomed in on key objectives for each 'mission,' with a focus on checking specific items off in each case. This really helped deliver the core experience, particularly during con games, pickup sessions, one-shots with first-time gamers, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381586/#Comment_381586" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T05:47:45+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  5:47AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Factory Records. <br/><br/>Factory were an independent record label based in Manchester, England. They were responsible for Joy Division/New Order and Happy Mondays, among many other less successful bands. Their entire ethos was 'fuck what's commercially sensible, this is punk art, we're going to do what we want'. Co-founder Tony Wilson once said (I paraphrase) 'When someone buys something from you they are entering into a relationship with you. So why not make that object as wonderful as possible? It's sort of a respect to the punter thing'.  <br/><br/>I published Other Worlds in exactly this fashion. I spent a lot of money on the production values, including hiring two editors, getting Storn Cook to do all the art, and Fred Hicks to do the layout. Not to mention spending years writing, testing, and polishing the manuscript in the first place to make sure it was as complete and user-friendly as possible. This is a terrible strategy for commercial success - an unknown designer spends several years and nearly $4k producing a 210 page magnum opus that requires no supplements - but fuck it, the result is that I have a fantastic looking game that I am very proud of and that many other people have enjoyed. But nearly six months in I still haven't quite made my money back despite being a silver best seller on DriveThruRPG. Would I do it all again the same way? Yes, absolutely! Because fuck what's profitable this is art. <br/><br/>As a little homage I gave Other Worlds its own FAC number (as all Factory Records products had) and hid a few New Order song titles and lyrics in the text itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381587/#Comment_381587" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T06:19:02+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  6:19AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the management crap I learned on training courses for work, and all the experience that I have from work of managing people, help support my play and GMing.

What I've learned is that a lot of new managers and bad managers don't really trust their staff, or they feel like they have to prove their right to be the manager by always having the right answer and so on. Whereas good managers do trust their staff and feel confident enough in their position to just ask staff what they think and admit when they've made a mistake and someone else is right. So now when I see someone post about uppity players or how 'story design by committee' doesn't work I just think: you're a bad manager, that's why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381609/#Comment_381609" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T08:45:17+00:00" title="June  9, 2012  8:45AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly science articles, of which I'm really into all the brain science that's been coming out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am playing with some concepts from some design books like "100 Things Designers Should Know About People".

Actually I should read it again, I wonder if I'd pick up something new after designing for a dozen years or so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381731/#Comment_381731" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T14:43:21+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  2:43PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Radiolab often inspires me - the segment from years ago on <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/2008/feb/25/contagious-laughter/" rel="nofollow">contagious laughter</a> has wormed its way into two games of mine so far, and may make another comeback soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381735/#Comment_381735" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T15:36:45+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  3:36PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Partly out of frustration with how it's been represented in RPGs in the past (and to a lesser extent the present), an awful lot of what I design draws inspiration from anime and manga. It would be hard to narrow it down much past that, but among the series that have inspired me are Madoka Magica, Azumanga Daioh, Hidamari Sketch, Macross, Dragon Half, and Slayers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/OScar" title="OScar"><img alt="OScar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/OScar">OScar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381820/#Comment_381820" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T00:27:39+00:00" title="June 11, 2012 12:27AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TED talks.

When I got to RPGs I was all, "Oh, I know how to handle a group." So now I use those skills for RPGs instead of bible studies. It helps as a player, too.<br/><br/>There's lotsa non-game stuff that influences my design, but since I don't have anything finished I don't think it's worth talking about yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381903/#Comment_381903" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T13:47:07+00:00" title="June 11, 2012  1:47PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The movie "Hero" keeps reminding me that what I really want at a table (and what games like "Whitness the Murder of your Father and Be Ashamed, Young Prince" enable) is a game of story telling, with urgency and intrigue, where the telling of the tale tells more than the tale itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381998/#Comment_381998" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-11T23:53:57+00:00" title="June 11, 2012 11:53PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the more I listen to black metal music, the more I want to make a game that 'feels' like black metal sounds.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Figaro" title="Figaro"><img alt="Figaro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Figaro">Figaro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382146/#Comment_382146" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T18:45:39+00:00" title="June 12, 2012  6:45PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2012 6:45PM by Figaro.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Impro (Keith Johnstone's books)</blockquote>\nvery much this one<br/><br/>also "free play - imrovisation in life and art" by nachmanovitch<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
