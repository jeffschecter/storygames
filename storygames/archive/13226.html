My name is Jason S. Walters, and I\u2019ve been put in charge of a lot of much of the day-to-day running of Indie Press Revolution. Actually, I ran a fair amount of it for Brennan for the last several years, but under the new management my responsibilities have been expanded to include updating the website, uploading digital products, speaking directly with publishers, and answering any questions about orders customers (both retail and individual) may have. I also am often the first person a new publisher encounters, so I thought it would be a good idea to introduce myself and explain who I am.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho Are You Dude? <br/>\nI\u2019ve been involved in the tabletop game industry for roughly ten years (though like many of you I\u2019ve played RPGs since I was a teenager). I was one of the investors who helped buy Hero Games from Cybergames, allowing Darren Watts and Steve Long to restore that venerable IP after its near demise. I\u2019m an occasional author of roleplaying games, fiction, and articles (my bibliography can be found here). I worked on Champions Battlegrounds, which won the 2002 Gold ENnie Award for best non-d20 adventure, and coauthored Lucha Libre Hero, which was nominated this year for Best Supplement. I also work as an editor for Blackwyrm Books and Games, an imprint I run with my friend Dave Mattingly, and served on the board of the Game Publisher\u2019s Association for two years. <br/>\n<br/>\nWho Are You NOT Dude?<br/>\nI do not claim to be a designer of Indie or Storytelling games (though I think I\u2019ll be taking a crack at it in 2011). I am, however, a voracious consumer of non-traditional roleplaying games, and have been since I first encountered Dogs In the Vineyard. I find the work of Indie publishers to be fascinating, and like to play Storytelling games whenever I can at conventions. I believe that I have a good grasp of the Traditional vs. Indie paradigm, and can make reasonably intelligent choices on what should and should not be considered \u201cIndie.\u201d I have also been thoroughly debriefed by Brennan on what he considers appropriate for IPR, and very much wish to continue his legacy in this regard.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, however, I am but one of several people who will be reviewing new titles as they are submitted, and have more of a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d function when contacted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also not the person in charge of money, policy, or \u201cbig picture\u201d stuff at IPR (though I do get consulted on these things). I\u2019m the guy who runs the warehouse, uploads PDFs, updates the website, answers emails, and tries to figure out why so-in-so in Slovenia didn\u2019t get her copy of Spirit of the Century. That kind of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy Are You Telling Us This?<br/>\nBecause I want you to sell your products through IPR, of course! It\u2019s a logical home for the experimental, the exciting, and the odd in the world of roleplaying games, and where many individual customers and retailers go to look for them. If your games are any or most of those things, we can get them out there for you and probably make you some money. But I can\u2019t sell them if I don\u2019t know what they are, which is why I\u2019m introducing myself, actively joining this forum (as opposed to my habit of lurking), and making myself available if you have any questions that I can answer. <br/>\n<br/>\nJason S.

If I were you, I wouldn't make too much of the 'indie' thing.<br/><br/>My take on it is that IPR was set up back when folks were making a big deal about it, but today there's increasing recognition that 'indie' has no clear reference and anyway the borders between whatever it is and whatever 'mainstream' is are getting more and more blurry. So in a way it's a bit of a nuisance that the site has 'indie' in its name and branding. Clearly in the last few years it's expanded its horizons to become <i>almost</i> a general sales channel.<br/><br/>Having said all that - yes, there's an important and useful question there. Where is IPR setting its sights, in terms of what kinds of stuff it will carry?<br/><br/>PS - I hope Brennan gives your briefs back now the cold weather's coming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297953/#Comment_297953" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-22T07:46:36+00:00" title="October 22, 2010  7:46AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

But past that I am unwilling to give away any of our secrets.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Is the DOJ Logistics website still up? I thought we had taken that down as part of our plan to switch almost entirely to social networking. But, yes, those rates should still be current-ish. I\u2019ll send you a sample copy of our contract if you wish, as it\u2019s more specific and up to date.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Whether or not a product is owner-created can become a pretty tricky subject. I could make an excellent case that Hero Games publishes almost exclusively owner created product, but I know that\u2019s not what you mean. Nevertheless, the focus of IPR is and shall remain unique, quality roleplaying games created and published by creative individuals or small groups of people. But we\u2019re not going to exclude, for example, books by Ken Hite because they are published by Pelgrane or Atomic Overmind. Unique and quality are unique and quality no matter who publishes them.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) What\u2019s all the fuss?
