My cohorts and I discussed this on the 6th episode of Canon Puncture Podcast.<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/canonpuncture" rel="nofollow">Check out the show</a>.<br/><br/>I discuss my feelings about buying used copies of Sorceror books [...]</blockquote>\nThe exact show is <a href="http://www.sgfireteam.com/podcast/canon_puncture_show_06.mp3" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Do you feel guilty about selling used games, "indie" or otherwise? Guilty about buying them?<br/><br/>I've gotta say, I don't feel the slightest compunction. First, as we've discussed recently, the indie/non-indie split is a lot less stark than people often make out.<br/><br/>Second, by buying a used game, you're supporting the overall market. It's one less copy in circulation at a discount, so the next sale is going to have to come at full price. Also, if somebody knows they'll be able to sell a game if they don't like it, they'll be more likely to take a chance buying it in the first place.<br/><br/>Third, simply getting games into active play encourages additional purchases. If you've been waiting on buying the game, but a discounted copy is what finally makes you give it a try, then so be it.<br/><br/>But most of all, I think the idea that buyers "owe" producers is flawed. If you believe in operating through a market-type exchange, then let the market do its job by discounting products that turn out to be worth less to the consumer than the seller asks.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, I disagree with the idea of buying games just to "support the line/author/business model". With all due to respect to orklord, that's exactly the path that leads toward unplayable, unplayed, "collector's item" games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70829/#Comment_70829" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T11:28:07+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 11:28AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Get those games into a good home where they will be played.<br/><br/>ASAP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70834/#Comment_70834" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T11:33:32+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 11:33AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, seriously, as a publisher I've got no objection to people selling, trading, loaning or giving away my game book.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70846/#Comment_70846" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T11:42:10+00:00" title="May 21, 2007 11:42AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2007 11:48AM by Andy.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I pretty much sell, trade or give away anything that I don't feel that I'm going to play within one year.

It enables "early adopters" to try out more games, and as you point out,  take bigger risks, by putting cash back into their pockets.  And they "buffer" the cost of games for me...  I get to buy more games than I'd be able to afford at full-price.  I like high-turnover early-adopters... they subsidize my gaming hobby. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I buy a lot of my games used... the mainstream, $40-and-up books, almost exclusively used.

Note: there are several POVs represented there, from "I felt kinda guilty" to "there's nothing to be concerned about at all".<br/><br/>Also, I'm glad to see writers encouraging the secondary market and borrowing. My personal modus operandi is: if I pretty much have a game of something lined up, I'm happy to pay full price/brand new to get a copy quickly and read up on the rules.<br/><br/>I do have a collection of stuff purchased either on the "maybe, someday" theory, or out of curiosity about some mechanic, or even bordering on buying to read about a cool setting (Jorune), engage in nostalgia (High Fantasy), and/or look at the purdy pitchers (Jorune, Zir'An). But without a strong commitment to play, I limit myself to used purchases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70902/#Comment_70902" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T14:30:00+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  2:30PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eliot, <br/><br/>In the market we find ourselves in I often borrow books from friends, read them, and if they lead to play buy them.

I mean, c'mon, its less than an hour and I use a funny sound effect when people say curse words).  However, yes, I felt guilty when I found some indie games at a local bookstore and bought them.  Why?  Because I had already put them in my cart on IPR and nearly bought them several times, but held off due to budgetary concerns.  I was going to buy them, there was no question in my mind about it.  Its just hard to justify buying a game when you figure you won't get to play it for six months.  I had already bought one of the books on the shelf but delayed purchase of the supplements.  Then there they were at $6.50 a piece!<br/><br/>The reasons for my guilt are as follows:<br/>* I want to reward creative people who decide to put out a product that I want.<br/>* The used book price was $6.50, the book was only $20 at IPR (with free shipping if I bought $25 worth). So, I saved some money, but not a ton.  <br/>* All of the money went to a bookstore that doesn't support the indie game industry (listen to the show to hear more about it).  <br/>* The creators won't see a penny of my purchase.<br/>* The books could have been purchased by someone who might have never bought the game, whereas I was already going to buy it<br/><br/>So, I'm the strawman.  Go ahead, whack away with your free love and hippiness and all that rot. I would think at least some of the game designers out there would like some scratch for their hard work.  I know they've earned it.<br/><br/>Of course, my cohorts on the podcast soundly beat me for my <i>nonsensical </i>ideals, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71039/#Comment_71039" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T07:52:16+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  7:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2007 7:52AM by Rich Stokes.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Orklord,<br/><br/>Cool to hear your thoughts on this, that's some neato interesting stuff.  I will reply because I sense that your guilt needs to be soothed:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: orklord</cite>The reasons for my guilt are as follows:<br/>* I want to reward creative people who decide to put out a product that I want.</blockquote>\nThis is a fine and respectable philosophy.  And you are actually supporting them in a whole bunch of ways.\n<blockquote>* The used book price was $6.50, the book was only $20 at IPR (with free shipping if I bought $25 worth). So, I saved some money, but not a ton.</blockquote>\nBut you also spent money that you had not spent previously.  Unlike you, I do not qualify for cheap or free shipping from IPR.  So to me, purchases are carefully considered unless I can get them direct from the creator (who tend to charge less than IPR for shipping - The subject of the cost of shipping from IPR to non-US addresses is not one I wish to discuss right now).<br/><br/>But the point is, you HADN'T bought those games from IPR.  There's also a real possibility that you never would have.  There are three kinds of games in my collection: "Must Haves", "Impulse Buys" and "Cos They Were Cheap"s.<br/><br/>Must Haves are things I decided I wanted to buy, then went and bought.  (That might be going to a shop or going to a website).<br/><br/>Impulse Buys are things I either saw in a shop and bought or saw at a con and bought.<br/><br/>Because They Were Cheap used to mean "Second hand" or "off some bloke on ebay".<br/><br/>More recently, (due to the shipping costs) got added to an order because once you're over that arserape cost of getting a package from the US to the UK, another $5 shipping on top for one more book seems pretty cheap.  I don't mind admitting that some of the Indie stuff I have falls firmly into that category.  SotC, for example was a game that I wanted to buy, but couldn't justify the shipping on an order to IPR just for that.  So I bought a couple of other things I thought looked neat because, well, I might as well.  So I ended up with copies of Burning Sands: Jihad and Hero's Banner as well, which I'd previously had no serious intention of buying.  Don't get me wrong, both are fantastic products, but the option of getting them "cheap" was what made me buy them.\n<blockquote>* All of the money went to a bookstore that doesn't support the indie game industry (listen to the show to hear more about it).</blockquote>\nBut the person who bought them in the first place did.  He bought them from the publisher or IPR or whatever.  I mean put it like this:<br/><br/>Scenario A) Andy buys a copy of Indie Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23418&amp;Mode=like">#418</a>.  He reads it and thinks it's cool and all, but realises that life being life, he probably won't get to play it any time soon.  So he decides to sell it.<br/><br/>Later he buys Indie Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23419&amp;Mode=like">#419</a> because, hey, even if he doesn't get to play it he can recoup some of the money by selling it on.<br/><br/>Scenario <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Andy buys a copy of Indie Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23418&amp;Mode=like">#418</a>.  He reads it and thinks it's cool and all, but realises that life being life, he probably won't get to play it any time soon.  Because he feels a sense of duty, honour and guilt towards the author, he doesn't sell the game on.<br/><br/>Later, he passes on Indie Game <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23419&amp;Mode=like">#419</a>.

I think it is subject to some sort of time limit, like copyrights.<br/><br/>The philosophy being that Artist should benefit for the creating the object that has increased in value, and the Collector should benefit for recognizing its future value and taking the risk in investing in it.  <br/><br/>I don't see much correlation between this and selling a used RPG.  Both are intellectual property.  But the similarity stops there in my opinion.  The artwork is in most cases the some total containment of the intellectual property.  The RPG is just the handbook, the shorthand for the intellectual property.  It is not the intellectual property itself.  Therefore a particular RPG book will not increase (typically) in value over time because it, itself, is not the object of value.  <br/><br/>A more direct approach of the fee paid to the Artist for value added by the intellectual property over time model, would be that if every time you sat down to utilize the ideas, you had to pay a fee. In the other words, every time you gamed, you pay.  Sounds kind of like a MMORG, doesn't it?<br/><br/>A lot of this conversation is starting to feel like the current struggle in all media.  As distribution of your product can be done virtually for free, and the ability for third parties to distribute your product is virtually free, how do you get rewarded for your product?<br/><br/>If you can answer that one, there are a lot folks with a lot of money who would be willing to pay for that knowledge.  For me personally, I buy what I use.  I encourage others to do so as well.  I feel a moral obligation to reward the person who created the basis for my enjoyment.  I do so because I want them to continue to do so in the future, and because I genuinely appreciate their efforts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71138/#Comment_71138" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T13:12:40+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  1:12PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A thread with nobody taking the opposite side is not a discussion. So I'll play devil's advocate, and people can correct me where they understand the arguments more clearly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I understand correctly (and I may not), there is a notion about with authors that, essentially, a book constitutes a single license to read the work. That, basically, what's being sold is not the medium of the book or PDF or whatever, but the access of an individual to the IP. If this is true, then not only is selling a book illegal or even loaning it (unless you have not read it), but public libraries should be banned as well. They being books purchased and shared by whole communities.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile this sounds crazy, consider the theoretical ramification. A national library purchases one copy of a book. Then they put it online for anyone in that nation to "borrow." How is this not simply legitimized piracy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally think that the issues of media making distribution of ideas easy will have to be overcome with some new solution. Once all of you Luddites give up your dead-tree media, and move on to the 21st century, it's going to come to a head. There has to be other methods of paying the author.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, 'lo, some have emerged. Ransom publishing, for instance. Subscriptions? (<a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=20833" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=20833</a>) Just selling advertising on the download space?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure more will evolve.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps someday they'll come up with some medium that can only be unlocked by one person's brain. DRM for your genetic code? Until then, however, I think that the notion of sale of right to read is problematic at best.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much for devil's advocate...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71160/#Comment_71160" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T14:07:33+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  2:07PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2007 2:07PM by Arminius.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>The only correction I can offer is that in this instance it wasn't an author who had this notion, but a fan.

But as I recall, it's exactly as JD said: book publishers have tried to legally block libraries from lending out books, and libraries exist solely because they have a lobbying group that has fought against onerous changes to copyright law. And yet, so long as lending libraries are legal, book publishers continue to sell to libraries, because money is money. Book publisher have also contested the legality of used book stores, which is why the courts established the first-sale doctrine as a limitation on copyright.</p>\n<p>There are identical situations with other media. The movie industry tried to outlaw video rental stores. The record industry tried to outlaw used record stores. I believe the record industry <em>did</em> successfully make CD/record rentals illegal. It's a long-running fight between publishers and distributors, with consumers always getting the short end of the stick.</p>\n<p>The RPG industry is actually blessed, in that there are many small publishers, most of them self-publishers, who take a different attitude towards selling used games. I'm not sure what Wizards of the Coast thinks about used copies of D&amp;D or people lending their copies to friends, but the fact that the SRD explains pretty much all the rules and is available for free from their website suggests that they're OK with that. The idea of licensing printed materials instead of selling them doesn't seem to be as strong in our hobby as it is in the general publishing industry.</p>\n<p>Electronic media is another matter, but I would hope that somehow we can create a compromise that allows creators to be paid and owners to share, so that both sides are rewarded. Since it is a hobby industry, and the creators are a lot closer to their customers than Random House is to theirs, maybe there's some hope. In the meantime, I would suggest that we think about pricing our games so that we can earn back the value of the time we spent creating our products and not worrying as much about what happens to sales after we've recouped our costs.</p>\n<p>I'm of the strong opinion that worrying about "fake profits" (sales that haven't occurred and may never occur) is a dangerous belief.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71221/#Comment_71221" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T19:23:37+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  7:23PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Oh, and an aside: I believe libraries actually get a <em>discount</em> on book purchases.

Sweet!<br><br>OK, more sensibly, that's arse.  It's the thing the that made me lost interest in the music industry, that they can't decide what, exactly, they're selling me and can't come up with a reasonable explanation that sounds like something I'd want to pay money for.  Am I paying for the CD?  If so, it's my fucking CD now and I'll do what I damn well please with it, including copying it to my PC and MP3 player.  Am I paying for a license to play that music?  If so, please let me have it in an indestructible, unstealable and infinitely portable format so I'll always be able to play it forever NO MATTER WHAT.  Am I paying for the right to listen to it?  If so, what happens when my buddies come over, do I have to turn my stereo off unless I happen to be listening to music they've paid for too?  Also, does that make me guilty of theft whenever I hear pop music on the radio, because I'll tell you now, they'll get the money to pay for my right to listen to Scooch by prying it from my cold, dead hand*.  Make up your minds.<br/><br/>I realise that there are sectors of all industries which start crapping themselves whenever they think that someone might be experiencing their IP without paying.  That, alas, is the way of things.  That why so much money is wasted each year on things like DRM and Regioning for videogames and DVDs.<br/><br/>As another aside, there was a case recently where <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20070512_mikeoldfield.shtml" rel="nofollow">Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells album was given away for free with a Sunday paper</a>.  A deal was brokered between the music label (EMI) and the paper, without consulting or even informing the artist.  First he heard about it was seeing an advert for it on TV.  "By the way Mike, we're giving your album away for free to 2.2 million people, and there's nothing you can do about it,"  I guess that's one of the dangers of having someone else owning the rights to your work.<br/><br/>*Actually, they get it from my license fee.

So the answer is, no, if your dogs eats your book the author is not responsible for what happens on your end.  It's a total one way street.  All the money is going on one direction and that is how they want it.<br/><br/>I will come out on a limb here and take a stand - IP is rubbish.  Rather, I should say, IP regulation is crap.  The music industry is learning this.  The movie industry is learning this and the book industry is not far behind.  <br/><br/>There is only one way to control information.  Not distribute it.  If you let it leave you're mind and your hands then it is no longer yours.  PERIOD.  If you want to get paid for it then you need to sell it at a price that is fair to you.  To be honest this is where the indie industry fails.  In the mainstream structure you have publishers.  Publishers pay authors to write.  They have then been paid for their efforts.  PERIOD.  Now it's up to the publisher to attempt to recoup their overhead.  Trust me.  They do.  With mainstream RPGs the margins are way closer, no doubt.  The distributers are meant to alleviate some of that burden by buying in bulk (200-1000 copies) and distribute them to stores.<br/><br/>As long as stores order and customers buy then everyone does what they are here to do.<br/><br/>Now it's laughable that I am lauding the mainstream.  But this is why I handle mainstream PDFs regularly and mainstream music with impunity.  Everyone has gotten their pound of flesh and now are just getting greedy.<br/><br/>That being said, the indie market then has a challenge.  Why do we write games?  Is it to say we're a game designer?  Is it to bring people joy?  Is it to make a living?  <br/><br/>Time and time again we learn that the digital age is upon us.  Information runs freely... no, not freely, rampant.  Sell your books at a price that you feel is reasonable.  But then you need to let it go because you have no say nor any control once it's left your sweaty palms.  Live with it.  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>Lastly, my MO is a little altered when dealing with indie artists of all sorts.  I generally buy directly from them and ask my friends to buy and not rely on the PDF or book I might offer them to sample the material.  And honestly if they like what they read they do buy it.  But that is community reinforcement and not something that can be codified by the authors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
