You say, "I take the ring from you", and I answer, "no way!" We roll dice.<br/><br/>Let's say we get to the third round and I have to Answer you. I can say, if I want, "I hold on to the ring as you beat the crap out of me."<br/><br/>But what if I had the upper hand during the second round, and you're Answering me now, and I win. Can you say, "I grab the ring from you, and you beat the crap out of me"?<br/><br/>That's interesting, because you got what you wanted in return for giving me The Stick, and thus potentially paying for the ring with two die sizes.<br/><br/>But, now, what if we went to the third round with you Challenging, and then _I_ won? Do I get to say, "I take the ring from you and beat the crap out of you"?<br/><br/>That means I get what I want _and_ I can negotiate for additional pain or reduce your dice.<br/><br/>This is my understanding of how the rules work.

I believe it works like this: the person taking the action is the one who describes how they are trying to change the status quo. The answerer describes only how the other guy doesn't reach their goal with their action; they don't get to somehow cram in an action of their own (like "I take the ring back from you") into their Answer.  If you're answering, you're not achieving, you're only blocking.

Only what the Answerer, the person being Challenged, gets to narrate into the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy understanding is that the Answerer must describe the events to clearly describe who has the advantage in the conflict. BUT since there is no stakes, they don't have to give the ring up. Because it is not at stake. Even if it is what the fight started over. Consequently, there is no limit to how often the ring can be narrated in. There is nothing in the rules stopping anyone from repeating actions or re-introducing certain elements in the fiction. But this is all limited by group style and tastes. If your players think something is bogus, then I don't think it flies.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo contradict myself earlier, in a way, winning the 3rd round as the Answerer is great but since there are no stakes, and no stakes that stick, there is nothing stopping someone from just attacking you again. Winning the 3rd round doesn't protect you from future actions. And it should be noted that even if someone could attack you again over the ring doesn't mean you are repeating the same conflict. It's not a do-over. Time, location, negotiation details, and damage sustained have all changed. And regardless of who the Answerer is, the person doing the damage gets to describe (with GM approval and within the guidelines of the group's play style) how that damage is applied. So they could chop off your hands. So sure, we may be fighting over the ring again (which is not at stake, it is just the reason we started fighting initially) but now you have no hands!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175772/#Comment_175772" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-22T07:10:44+00:00" title="October 22, 2008  7:10AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2008 7:12AM by lumpley.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul: "I take the ring and beat the crap out of you" is a challenge, not an answer.
