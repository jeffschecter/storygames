Planescape was the second game I ever GMed for more than 1 session. In terms of the change being slow, I completely agree. What we did was always center the conflict around the tipping points. Change is slow but instead of a plane shrinking, it instead started to crack away at its foundations. So when belief was low enough, the plane would finally separate and float off to be swallowed by something else. The end results shifting the power balance. Playing at that moment before the tipping point was amazing!

During 2nd edition, TSR did a few boxed sets in that world, Principalities of Glantri, The Grand Duchy of Karameikos and Red Steel*. Red Steel was actually kind of cool, dark swashbuckling, and Karameikos was basically a super vanilla setting that was well designed for adventuring. <br/><br/>Now, in the original stuff, Glantri was pretty silly, since it was one of two wizardly nations, and it had been chock full of level 36 magic users and so on, but in creating th boxed sets they had kind of kicked some of that to the curb, and instead you get this nation which is composed of several principalities, each of which is ruled by a particular person, group or family. They're all mages, since only mages can have any real political power, and clerics are actively discriminated against.  The capital city is full of magical spectacle and of course has a great magical academy at its heart.<br/><br/>The laser gun is a nod to the fact that Glantri was very near Blackmoor, and by old D&amp;D mythos, Blackmoor had high tech ruins (crashed spaceships and whatnot) so one of the NPCs has a magical weapon from Blackmoor, which they view as an oddly shaped wand.<br/><br/>It's not a deep setting by any stretch of the imagination, but it's got the kind of enthusiasm and gameyness that just makes it a joy to read.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>* The Hollow World was also technically in this line, since it was inside that world by default.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145646/#Comment_145646" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T07:53:13+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  7:53AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And now, a moment for self-appreciation:<br/><br/>...how in Perfect, the world of Cadence is mostly a collection of antagonists and targets. The Inspectors are this almost supernatural force who only really make <i>cinematic </i>sense. Conditioning and immediate re-release without supervision is a justice system that makes absolutely no sense in the real world. In the new version, each Certification includes a passage about what "some" members "allegedly" inappropriately use their power for. The entire world is designed in order to make hardcore scenes about frantic romantics torching City Hall in the name of love a default, rather than a one-off highlight. It's amazing how almost every player looks at this setting and sees something that they personally want to destroy within it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145647/#Comment_145647" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T07:56:26+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  7:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How Fading Suns gives me a futuristic setting full of medaevil social structures, attitudes, and superstitions<br/><br/>How Ars Magica gives me a map<br/><br/>How Poison'd gives me a geography whose landmarks are sins<br/><br/>The list of mutations in old Gamma World                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145668/#Comment_145668" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T09:31:02+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  9:31AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...how in Rifts you have a wacky blending of magic and technology that seems to inspire a countless number of splat books<br/><br/>...how in Ninjas and Superspies I can play a drunken martial artist<br/><br/>...how in Contenders, the pathos for the boxers made me want to actually watch boxing<br/><br/>...how in Jyhad (sp?), I can finally play Dune without touching my precious copy of Dune                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145676/#Comment_145676" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T09:51:19+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  9:51AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Ever the iconoclast, me.)<br/><br/>...HERO, because it can handle almost any setting in table top play.<br/>...GLASS because it can handle any plausibly playable setting in LARP.<br/>...DitV because it can easily be drifted to another setting where authority is balanced by concern for those under your power.<br/><br/>(And more in the spirit of the thread.)<br/><br/>...Burning Wheel, for a novel, mechanically-reinforced take on "traditional" Tolkien races.<br/>...Dread: TFBOP, because it's a modern setting which lets me make Bush et al demon-possessed (it's the only explanation that makes sense, anymore).<br/>...Pendragon, because it really anchors me in Arthurian mythos and historical aspects of medieval life in England in the Dark Ages.<br/>...Star Wars (d20) because... well, damn, man... it's STAR WARS!

Ravenloft 1st ed. rulebooks for being so filled with a Gothic mood<br/>... Planescape for it's philosophers with clubs<br/>... Unknown Armies for "post-modern" approach and how it is about people<br/>... Fading Suns for it's science fiction-medieval setting and the great variety of campaigns that can be played<br/>... Amazing Engine's Bughunters for playing clones with copied memories battling aliens<br/>... Paranioa for it's Fear and Ignorance and because I have a weak spot for dystopias<br/>... My Life with Master for being so intense and a simple rulesystem that easily supports my fellow players immersive techniques<br/>... Polaris for being so evocative and having such a fascinating rulesystem<br/>... Transhuman Space for it's hard science and for it's core theme "What is human?"<br/>... The Shadow of Yesterday because my players really loves those keys and it inspires them to play in totally cool ways and then rewards them for doing it<br/>... Whispering Vault for it's setting and character concepts, which taught me important stuff about generating characters<br/>... Don't Rest your Head for the dice mechanics (but the setting didn't do it for me, so I replaced most of it with a dark version of Danish folklore)<br/>... Burning Empires for all it's cool ideas and tidbits, many of which I have stolen for other games<br/>... Covert Generation for it's setting, that always awakens my desire for playing more, more, more<br/>... GURPS Goblins because this setting it frackinly cool, you play goblins (only species in existence) in a Victorian England, where difference in social status gives penalties in combat (in other words social status becomes a hard factor) and the idea that enviroment means everything in the upbringing of the goblin, but genetic heritage nothing (each goblin is born genderless, hairless etc. and develops these traits through it's upbringing). Now I just need some rules to play this setting with, as GURPS doesn't do it for me.<br/>... IAWA for doing it down and dirty<br/>...
