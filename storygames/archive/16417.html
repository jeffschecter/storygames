It went excellently. The game is called Gonzo, and it's about Gonzo journalists in a world where grindhouse cinema (Satanic hippies, shotgun-toting vigilantes, martial arts showdowns) is real. It uses Jared Sorensen's InSpectres as the game engine with tweaks and mods by me.<br/><br/>The journalists (and a chemistry teacher) were assigned a story by their magazine editor to go to New Orleans and find out what their state rep was up to. Word was he had a nose for coke and had gone missing in New Orleans, so they got a bus and a chemistry set and hit the road. They got a bit sidetracked after they picked up a hitchhiker who looked suspiciously like David Cassidy. They gave him a bunch of drugs and he freaked out and pulled a pistol on them. The struggle to get the gun away from him shot out a bunch of windows, but the took his shirt and pants away from him in repayment and left him along the roadside.<br/><br/>When they arrived in New Orleans, word on the street was that the rep was buying up all the coke in the city and importing some from the Colombians for a drug yacht. They hatched a plan to get onto the yacht, shoot some photos and get some quotes and get off there. Some smart wardrobe choices, as well as a convincing story ("I'm the last senator of the Cherokee Nation.") got them onto the boat.<br/><br/>Everything was going as planned until alligator riding cannibals attacked, turning the entire boat into a blood-crazed orgy of violence. The politicians, fuelled by coke and bloodlust, fought not only the cannibals but began to fall on one another. A rescue mission sent by the Coast Guard, horrified by what they saw, opened fire on everything and everyone on the boat. The investigators managed to throw some chemicals into the ship's engine, and then steer it aground, crashing up over the New Orleans docks and into the streets. The yacht tipped sideways sending blood, limbs, and politicians spilling all over the streets. After enduring all this, they walked into a bar and ordered a stiff drink.<br/><br/>"What happened out there?!"<br/>"Politics."<br/><br/>The rules were great, including the rules for drug use. The pacing of the game was fine. I need to iron out how Freakouts work a little better. Spotlight sharing was the only serious issue. Only one person makes a roll, so the game turned into a situation where whoever spoke loudest and first could dominate the action. I'm not sure if this is just a GM table management thing, or if I can come up with a solution (I have some ideas). But overall it worked great. I'm hoping to run it at some more cons. Maybe even DexCon.<br/><br/>I'm also curious how it will run without my friend Jere at the table, because that guy just nails the whole gonzo journalism, deranged drugged craziness.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375259/#Comment_375259" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T15:24:14+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  3:24PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds awesome!

It definitely benefits from a knowledge of the source material, and it's a source material that I think most of us are not saturated in like we are with other stuff. Ian knows a lot about that stuff, though, so hopefully we'll be able to distill that and make it useful for people into the game without having to read all of Hunter S. Thompson's books. Though with all things like this, I'd be surprised to find group that wants to run/play a game based on Gonzo journalism didn't have one person at the table who had some knowledge of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375284/#Comment_375284" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T15:54:45+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  3:54PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is immensely exciting to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mcellis" title="mcellis"><img alt="mcellis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mcellis">mcellis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375310/#Comment_375310" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T16:33:32+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  4:33PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you have a link to the rules for drugs and freakouts or any other rules tweaks you used for this game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375319/#Comment_375319" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T16:44:00+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  4:44PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WANT, please.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes" title="WPTunes"><img alt="WPTunes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/193/nI9P6PIU22T8F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WPTunes">WPTunes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375321/#Comment_375321" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T16:47:29+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  4:47PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just listened to the Jennisodes episode where you discussed this briefly.
