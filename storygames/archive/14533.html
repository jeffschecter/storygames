Ironic really, considering if they'd left him alone he would have continued the life of a fussy little scholar at Heidelburg University, his loathing of travel and meager grants making that one discovery the highlight of an otherwise dull life.

Lillith. Izanami. Gaia. The First and Last Queen of Atlantis smiled sadly as she made her way down the hill from her now lifeless stasis chamber and through the fur-clad crowd. Wiping away her tears, she thought back to the beginning of things. The earth had begun to fail her people, so they came back to when it was still young. With the greatest of their craft and skill, they filled the empty expanses and founded a golden age. The earth, however, turned against them once more. Their cities, with their thundering towers, asked too much of the land and sky. Their journey back itself had taxed the foundations of the world, and it fought back to throw them off. In the end, she was all that remained. All that could be saved.<br>\n<br>\nThe people stared at her with reverent fear in their golden eyes. Their bronze bodies were perfect in beauty and strength, and though their thoughts were simple, they wouldn't be for long. She turned her mind inward, and changed the precious genetic material in her womb. She made it simpler. Cruder.

She landed loudly in a cloud of feathers and looked up at the woman next to her. She was frowning and had her arms crossed tightly. "Sorry, Instructor," the girl said meekly, folding her wings behind her back as demurely as she could.<br/>\n<br/>\nWho is the girl, and where is she going?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331802/#Comment_331802" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T01:23:36+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  1:23AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Instructor's frown didn't clear; she pulled Flora out of the line of fellow students before they boarded the gravbus.
