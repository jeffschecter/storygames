It's a balance: don't hold yourself back from describing dramatic stuff; but, also, remember that there's fun in the low-key stuff. One of our best conflicts, in the Roach, was between a history professor and a physics professor. The history professor spotted a missing minus sign in the physicist's working.<br/><br/>The game, pretty much, runs itself. But since it's GM-less, don't hold back from:<br/><br/>* Entering other people's scenes at a comically bad moment.<br/>* Providing adversity to other players.<br/>* Letting your narration go wild. Don't just narrate what your character does: narrate buildings falling down and giant spider machines.<br/><br/>The Roach does require creativity. We've found it can flag towards the end. Don't be afraid to take a break halfway through, recharge your creative batteries, talk about other things, then go back to it.<br/><br/>Oh...I...disagree with most of what Jesse says on his blog. For me, the humour is in the characters being unlovable grotesques from the start; and from Roached characters just being extensions of the unRoached personality. After all, they wanted power before. Now they're just prepared to kill for it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176168/#Comment_176168" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T21:37:37+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  9:37PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>MURUB!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mans" title="mans"><img alt="mans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iRxOHEiGuPM/TuCnFScfciI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/PQTJfJAblzg/s45/rs.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mans">mans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176190/#Comment_176190" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T05:15:09+00:00" title="October 25, 2008  5:15AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Theres good stuff here, thanks.

Hey, M\xe5ns! Here's my advice:<br/><br/>Make sure that everyone knows that the connections set up in the beginning (you like the one to your left and hate the one to your right ... or was it the other way around?) are temporary. The players are free to have their characters change their minds in the first scene. I've had players fail to get this, so point it out.<br/><br/>Also, in your first scene, think of a way to really hurt (preferrably professionally or emotionally, rather than physically, this early in the game) the character you hate, and go for it. Once you've framed that conflict, it's a wonderful slippery slope to cutting off body parts and burning down buildings. But it's important to, well, get to the conflicts in this game, I think.<br/><br/>The Roach is the favourite indie game in my (slightly conservative) play group.

The dynamics of really working to like someone when they are working just as much to hate you are the beauty of the Roach.<br/><br/>With all respect to Simon, in this game, you really DON'T want two people really hating each other. That's too plebeian. You want those screwy relationships than spill over into zaniness.<br/><br/>I enjoy that 'love/hate' dynamic so much that I've brought it into other games (i.e. The Mountain Witch) and had some of my most satisfying gaming experiences ever.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite>Also, in your first scene, think of a way to really hurt (preferrably professionally or emotionally, rather than physically, this early in the game) the character you hate, and go for it. Once you've framed that conflict, it's a wonderful slippery slope to cutting off body parts and burning down buildings. But it's important to, well, get to the conflicts in this game, I think.</blockquote>\nAgreed.<br/><br/>So take Simon's comments as they are. But the game really does play well as written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176983/#Comment_176983" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-01T10:39:00+00:00" title="November  1, 2008 10:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mans</cite>You still need a enemy right?

But after that, hates and alliances were based on what was happening in the fiction we were creating. <br/><br/>The risk, I would think, of just sticking with your initial loves and hates would be static characters. When someone is doing their all to ruin my career, if my opinion of them never changes, then we are playing out some really static fiction. And I play these games to have interesting characters and see how they change based on the decisions they make and the experiences they live through.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
