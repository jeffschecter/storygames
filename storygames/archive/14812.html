Maybe you'll find it useful, and maybe you won't. It might even rattle some cages. In any case, please remember that while I have strong opinions on stuff, I'm not "anti-" anything. I'm just a guy with strong opinions, not a guy with an agenda.<br/><br/>Sometimes, it feels like I've been around on the outskirts of the industry since forever. I began my gamespotting back when I was still a teenager, not old enough to vote. I've known the days of usenet, and my active participation to hobby discussion began on the old RPG.net, back when Sandy Antunes still owned it and it felt more like a town than the sprawling metropolis it now feels like. More to the point, however, is the fact that I was around before the Forge-theory boom and the rise of story games.<br/><br/>In that boom, I saw a significant aspect of hobby discussion <i>die</i>. As Forge-theory exploded onto the hobby, discussions of GM craft withered away. Here, I'm using "GM craft" as a catch-all term for any and all discussions that were concerned with being the best GM you could be, independently from what game was used. It kind of died in two strokes, actually. The first came from Forge-theory: practical discussions centered on actual play best practices ended up being swarmed by theory-enthusiasts convinced that looking at the minute details of how to better be a GM amounted to addressing the symptom rather than the disease. The second came when story games reached critical mass, and there was enough variety on the market to suit various tastes. By then, the deeper end of best practice discussions had died down, drowned in theory. What was left were relative newcomers to the hobby (or gamers newly broadenning their horizon) , puzzled with questions of how to do this and that better. Things not deep enough for theory-enthusiasts to get into. On these questions, a bit of best practice discussion had managed to survive, until there were enough story games out there that these discussions innevitably turned into discussions of how some of these games did the work for you, and how they were better tools for the job.<br/><br/>It's a chicken or the egg thing, IMHO, because Forge-theory and the design trends that followed were born out of these best practice discussions. And I'm not blaming anyone specific for the way best practice discussions were smothered afterwards. I think it's only natural for a community to get all excited and obsessed once a breakthrough happens, and the state of story games today speak pretty clearly about how much of a breakthrough this all was. But it is a shame, though, because the basis for discussion about how to be a better GM and tell a better story together for people interested in doing that with traditional games is now years back, and hard to find. Sometimes, it's almost hard to remember that it's possible to talk about these things without entering the realm of design theory.<br/><br/>Is there a point to what I'm saying? More or less. On some level, I'm sharing my views on this because I think it's an aspect of how our hobby evolved that few have noticed, and I think it's interesting to think about it. Also, there's a bit of nostalgia there for me. These best practices are what made me the GM I am today, and it's a shame that I wouldn't encounter these discussions of I was today where I was at 15 years ago.<br/><br/>But in a way, this is kind of a manifesto. A lot of the drama surrounding the various design trends has died down, and I sort of feel like traditional RPGs and story games are today seen as two siblings that don't have to compete with each other for dominance. In that current climate, maybe it's time for a revival of sorts. Maybe it's time to actively start talking about traditional RPG best practices again, even if it feels forced at first. Just to build momentum, because it sure has died down by now.<br/><br/>And maybe we can gain from that little hiatus, as well. I know it'd be awesome to have story games aficionados ponder about how to port the best of their subset of gaming to traditional RPGs, without denaturing them or outright turning them into story games.<br/><br/>So there. Feel free to discuss or not, or whatever. Hopefully, some of you will find this is something interesting to think about, if only for a few minutes,                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336645/#Comment_336645" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T11:02:16+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 11:02AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: me</cite>On these questions, a bit of best practice discussion had managed to survive, until there were enough story games out there that these discussions innevitably turned into discussions of how some of these games did the work for you, and how they were better tools for the job.</blockquote>\nI feel like I need to clarify this part. I think the human brain is lazy, and posting thoughtful stuff on the internet invites laziness unless you make an effort. At the simple level, I think best-practice discussions died because the advent of story games brought discussions of which game to pick on the foreground, and traditional RPGs gamers jumped on board as well, chiming in on what their favorite game was.<br/><br/>The difference is, before the advent for story games, a request for advice on how to GM didn't bring into the discussion which game to pick. You would just go with whichever game the person was using, provided the issue wasn't directly tied to the task resolution engine or whatever. Story games, bringing in whole different ways to play, inserted the choice of game into the equation. Everyone jumped on board, and now the questions that get asked are not how can I best do this, but what game is best for me to do this. This happens even when fans of story games are nowhere in sight - which is sort of why I say best practice discussions have died down. They're simply not a way we're used to talking about gaming anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336648/#Comment_336648" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T11:10:38+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 11:10AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2011 11:17AM by mease19.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the breadth of games available, it strikes me as difficult to discuss best practices in an overarching sort of way.  Publications like the Fiasco Companion and the Adventure Burner and game-specific forums seem like the way of the future.  To be fair though, designers have gotten much better at telling you how to get the most out of a game.  AP seems like a good, if sparse, source of novel tips, tricks, gimmicks, and positive role models but the abundance of bad AP would require a solid distillation method to really be of use (a "best of" or "one best thing" -style blog, perhaps).<br/><br/>To note a parallel, when reading education journals I find myself frustrated by the abundance of educational theory articles and the dearth of articles that give you specific and actionable best practices - I just want some good ideas to implement!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336649/#Comment_336649" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T11:14:48+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 11:14AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think those discussion died for good reason. They were founded in the idea of "GM skill" being one thing, applicable broadly, across many different audiences, game systems, player expectations, genres, mechanics, etc. etc.<br/><br/>The internet - once it reached a critical mass of accessibility - destroyed that notion. One person's best practice was another person's worst nightmare, even within the "trad" community (broadly construed). Any best practice in the modern, diverse environment is going to be local to a particular set of culture, expectations, distribution of authority, genre, and so on.<br/><br/>You can see brutally divisive arguments over best practice even in communities constructed around a single game system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336651/#Comment_336651" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T11:21:19+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 11:21AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've noticed this, too.<br/><br/>My reading lists, etc, went from "101 tips on making memorable voices for NPCs" to theory topics and game design discussions.<br/><br/>However, I don't really miss those discussions, either. There were some useful tips, but also a lot of really really terrible advice (much of which I took to heart, as did most of the people I played with).<br/><br/>I still see people discuss it, especially here on Story Games. Jason Corley is a name that comes to mind! As does John S. (jenskot). Or Levi Kornelsen.<br/><br/>But the biggest surprise for me has been, however, that I really don't miss those conversations and all that advice. Game design has plugged a surprising number of those holes or dealt with those issues.<br/><br/>I wonder if I'm the only one for whom discussions about characterizing NPCs, describing landscapes, etc, were kind of... misguided? Useful, but not the high priority we thought they were.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336653/#Comment_336653" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T11:25:50+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 11:25AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Mark nailed it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think GM craft discussions died so much as the idea of universally applicable GM skillsets died, and deservedly so.  The idea of "GM Craft" as some thing you could learn and then reproduce at will was never really true, or put more accurately the Myth of GM Craft was far larger than the reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I agree that it was the internet, specifically the advent of web forums and social networking as superior tools to UseNet and Yahoo Groups that played a great part in bursting that myth.  Once everyone was able to talk to everyone people began to realize that what they had previously taken for a Universal GMing Truth was really only true...for them.  For others...not so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat Forge theory brought to discussion was the idea of Design Craft, where individual games could be custom designed for individual specific purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut those two things together and you have the situation today...which is less "how to be a great GM" and more "how to be a great GM...for this specific game" or even more broadly "how to be a great player, for this specific game".<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I wouldn't call it a "death" of GM Craft discussions so much as an evolution into something more specific and less general.  GM Craft for D&amp;D; 4E is a very different thing from GM craft for Grey Ranks (just to pull the most extreme example I could think of).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336654/#Comment_336654" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T11:28:06+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 11:28AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2011 11:28AM by Jesse.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>The difference is, before the advent for story games, a request for advice on how to GM didn't bring into the discussion which game to pick.</blockquote>\nI would like to make the suggestion that, that is because, at the time, all games were functionally the same game, or less charitably, the same non-game.  What you had was a strong emphasis on high-color concept, a LOT of fiction (called 'setting') and then basically a statistical model that attempted to encode that fiction in a sensible manner along RPG cultural expectations.  Appropriate stat set.  Appropriate skill set.  Acceptable bell-curve shape to the die mechanic.  Maybe a neat genre appropriate lever or dial you could set.  And that's about it.<br><br>The point is that, no matter how radically different the *fiction* was, the underlying *game* was identical across the board.  So, of course, you could have broad general GM advice because at the social/creative dynamic level all games were identical.  The play group literally had to forge their own local functional game that worked for them.  So, swapping advice about that was not only easy, it was down right NECESSARY.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336659/#Comment_336659" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T11:41:27+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 11:41AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I've noticed a revival in discussions of GM behavior recently, specifically surrounding how to effectively run Apocalypse World.  I tried to talk about why I thought this was in <a href="http://www.20by20room.com/2011/06/mastering-all-these-ceremonies/" rel="nofollow">an imperfect post on 20x20</a>, but I expect we'll see a lot more of it as some of the commercial AW hacks come out (Dungeon World, Monsterhearts) and start introducing new audiences to the idea of explicitly talking about and naming specific GM practices.  For me, these conversations so far have been the best of both worlds, rooted in specific practices aimed at a specific games but also -- in some cases -- requiring reflection on GMing practices as a whole.<br><br>Also, the general solution to issues like this ("there's not enough of X happening") is to be the change you want to see.  If there's a real need for something, anything you do in that regard will probably be enthusiastically supported by others.  Honestly, the indie games community feels very post-theory to me at this point.  We share a lot of background and familiarity with specific games, techniques, and practices, but very few folks are actively engaging in theory-making or theory discussions right now. So if there's something keeping these conversations about GM behavior from happening, I don't think it's us.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336663/#Comment_336663" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T11:55:36+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 11:55AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2011 12:17PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>This happens even when fans of story games are nowhere in sight - which is sort of why I say best practice discussions have died down.

I think what's stopping it now is that it has lost all momentum. In the current state of the gaming industry, if it were to gain back momentum, it definitely wouldn't get drowned down again.<br/><br/>Also, I want to make sure that everyone understand that I'm not playing the blame game either. In my mind, things that are radically new tend to burst into existence loudly, and then quiet down slowly to a reasonnable level. The loudness of Forge-theory bursting onto the scene drowned down GM craft discussions, but this has nothing to do with the essence of Forge-theory specifically,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336668/#Comment_336668" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T12:47:04+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 12:47PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Soooooo....let's back up. *record scratch*<br/><br/>Mark's premise is that it wasn't the Forge, but instead, the Internet that destroyed "GM craft" discussions.  I think this is true and extremely troubling. This:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>The internet - once it reached a critical mass of accessibility - destroyed that notion. One person's best practice was another person's worst nightmare, even within the "trad" community (broadly construed). Any best practice in the modern, diverse environment is going to be local to a particular set of culture, expectations, distribution of authority, genre, and so on.</blockquote>\nis the biggest indictment of the hobby that I can think of that doesn't stray into absurdity (like, say, accusing all pre-First Thoughts forum games of being "identical non-games". What baloney.)<br/><br/>Let's turn back to Mark's statement.<br/><br/>First, let's take as given the extremely wide variety of expectations, desires, and goals for RPGs, each set by individual groups with the various inputs into those groups across this fine green globe.  If we look at the history, all the way back to Usenet, then further into letters column and reports from conventions, we come to the inescapable conclusion that <i>this was always true</i>, that this was true the first day there were two gaming groups in existence, and nobody who took the time to think about it could ever conclude otherwise.<br/><br/>Yet the only, the ONLY thing that anyone did about it for THIRTY YEARS is to write some text in some books.<br/><br/>(Forge games did this the same way, which is not a surprise because the Forge was about creating and publishing your own game text.)<br/><br/>That's not to say that publishing is a bad idea, or shouldn't happen.  That's not to say that texts don't have something to teach about crafting your game (whether as GM or a player with another name). Discussion is another way of doing this, and some of us have taken to that, so all right.  Texts and Big Internet Discussion.<br/><br/>But what else is there?<br/><br/>Are there conferences we can attend which are focused on improving play? No. We might go to a panel (all panels are shitty panels) at a convention, a two hour block of time based around an extremely general topic.<br/><br/>I made a "GM's Conference" here in Tucson and ran it for two and a half years. It was <i>fucking amazing</i> because nobody had experienced anything like it.<br/><br/>We had speakers and presenters who would come in with some topic, related to their experiences, preferences and techniques, and just explain themselves, say what they wanted, and describe how they sought it out. That's ALL. That's like the bare, pathetic minimum of trying to improve things.  And yet there is simply nothing else like it in the hobby right now.<br/><br/>Shitloads of games have a GM, and having a conference where GMs discuss their goals, desires, drives, and techniques is so SIMPLE, so MINIMAL and nobody whose game has a GM is doing anything about it.<br/><br/>Fuck Apocalypse World, I mean, it's a cool looking game, but it's just another fucking text when it comes down to it. Yay, more fucking text, someone's selling me more text, wooo.<br/><br/>If we really want to improve our GMing (for games with GMs) or playing in general (for any game), where's:<br/><br/>* the mentoring system?<br/>* practice, practice and more practice?<br/>* the culture of criticism of performance?<br/>* the exercises?<br/>* the expectation that you will try to improve your play?<br/>* the systems by which you are exposed to many groups with many different goals and techniques? (player exchange? GM exchange?)<br/>* anything, anything, <i>anything in the whole fucking world</i> to help you improve, other than general discussion with the entirety of the Internet-posting hobby, and other than texts in a book someone wants to sell you?<br/><br/>I am the dumbest person in the universe, and I came up with these potential bullet points in thirty seconds. Someone who is actually smart could come up with a bunch more.<br/><br/>What Mark says is true, but it shouldn't have taken the Internet to get us to this point.<br/><br/>When you buy a game with a GM in it, in that game, it should tell you how to find another GM to mentor you or partner with for constructive feedback.  It should tell you how to give feedback, how to make it concrete and actionable.  <br/><br/>But let's be clear, we're in this position not because of something the Forge or Forge theory did or didn't do.<br/><br/>We're in this position because it is to <i>nobody's financial advantage</i> to improve the quality of your play.<br/><br/>Nobody gets paid when a GM does a great job.<br/><br/>Nobody loses money when a GM does a shit job.<br/><br/>Nobody gets paid when an Apocalypse World game goes great.<br/><br/>Nobody loses money when an Apocalypse World game goes off the edge and dies a horrible shitty death.<br/><br/>Nobody gets paid when a Polaris game really clicks and our four (presumably ideologically pure non-GM) players knock it out of the park.<br/><br/>Nobody loses money when a Polaris game fumbles and slops around and doesn't go anywhere.<br/><br/>It is to nobody's financial advantage for RPG <i>play</i> to be improved.  Only that it be "good enough" to get you to buy the next thing.<br/><br/>So RPG creators have said, meh, it's not my business.  I'm in the text-selling business.<br/><br/>(And maybe the discussion business, along with Internet assholes like myself.)<br/><br/>I am totally down with that, you choose the business you want to be in, and texts can be a piece of the puzzle.  Certainly texts matter!  RPG creators have done an amazing job.  (Yes, even in the 80s and 90s, with those, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha "identical non-games", snrk.)<br/><br/>But the idea that texts distributed (ideally) to lots of people are going to help them reach their idiosyncratic, individualized, always-shifting goals?<br/><br/>Just saying that idea out loud shows how silly it is, and always has been.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336670/#Comment_336670" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T13:00:58+00:00" title="August  1, 2011  1:00PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I thought of another thing. We've got texts, cool, we've got discussion, and we do have some theory. Now, I'm not against gaming theory. I think a solid theoretical underpinning can help out play. Look what it did for self-identified narrativists.  I think they were very well-served by GNS theory.  It helped them focus and evaluate how different experiences of play fulfilled their various desires. That's great.  <br/><br/>And when I mis-applied GDS to campaign design, it helped me make decisions there too. <br/><br/>Now, I think in general that the GNS level of the big model is malformed and disproven, GDS had its bizarre obsession with what the GM was thinking (rather than what they did), so comprehensive looks at gaming are very hard to come by (for the same reason Mark identifies, I think), but smaller theoretical examinations have developed and helped.  The effort ought to continue. A solid body of theory can help you improve your craft.<br/><br/>So we have texts, discussion, and theory.

I love all that stuff and read it all the time!<br/><br/>But it is only one input, and they're designed to be given to as big an audience as they can be sold to.<br/><br/>Edit: A thought experiment. Let's say Wizards wanted to improve D&amp;D4e play.  They say "we'll send an experienced GM to your group, help you figure out your goals, who will observe you and take notes, then give feedback, watch a second game and help you implement the feedback, and if it improves your play, you pay us $30, approximately what you would have paid for a DMG or DMG2".  Is there any doubt that this would improve play in a very different and significant way than publishing the DMG? It's not their motives that are in question, I'm sure they want D&amp;D4 play to be really good and satisfying, as do all RPG creators. But that's not the same as having an interest, a stake in good play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336673/#Comment_336673" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T13:09:49+00:00" title="August  1, 2011  1:09PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>is the biggest indictment of the hobby that I can think of</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>wait diversity is bad</p>\n<p>what</p>\n<p>I mean is this what you think about other things too, or just game practices?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336674/#Comment_336674" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T13:13:35+00:00" title="August  1, 2011  1:13PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>wait diversity is badwhatI mean is this what you think about other things too, or just game practices?</blockquote>\nNo, the bad part is that it took until the Internet for us to realize something we should have known on the second day the hobby existed, and should have already taken steps to accommodate and promote.

One of the things a lot of 'trad' games pushed really hard out of the late 80s into the 90s, IMO, is the GM as font of all story and good things. Now, there's some exceptions, this isn't universal, and it doesn't seem to me like this could possibly be how most folks actually played it, but the texts from that era are certainly much more concerned with imparting that the GM is where this stuff is at.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's now a lot more common to see discussion of what best practices are for the 'traditional' player roll.

Certainly the video made for <i>Grey Ranks</i> gave me a much better idea of what that game is about than any discussion of the game or review of it.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure why this is the case, but I suspect that it is due to simply seeing actual people playing ( even if a bit staged or re-enacted) is much closer to the way I've initially learned to play any games of any general type.<br/><br/>Whether this is viable or not for GM advice, I dunno, buit there is, for me anyway, something powerful about having a person come on and give me an initial run down of what something is about, even if they later point me towards a related text.<br/><br/>Also, to clarify that a bit, for myself, it really needs to be a persson, not a cartoon or visual representation or something similar like a slide show.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336708/#Comment_336708" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T16:33:44+00:00" title="August  1, 2011  4:33PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason's got it on one, though. There's no POSSIBLE financial benefit to the level of community involvement and one-on-one, tuned-for-your-group advice &amp; mentoring that it would take to deliver broad improvement in the standard of play. It's way more work than there is market for it. If anything, a constant level of dysfunction and dissatisfaction in the hobby is a sales driver for the new product that promises relief.<br/><br/>Hell, a lot of people are perfectly happy with the fairly mediocre (or even fairly cruddy) play they have, because their experience is that when you start messing about with critical approaches, changing techniques, altering power dynamics, trying different things in general - your group breaks up amid acrimony and frustration.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the big thing that's missing in this age of gaming is cons. Communities like NerdNYC are doing this stuff, some microcons are, but the Big Cons are largely sales-focused, where they were once more crucial to cross-pollination of games, groups, and technique. The internet has substituted for the social and community-building function of cons and game clubs, to the detriment of the hobby. It's much easier on the net to self-segregate, to retreat into dogma or edition-war or "trad vs indie" or Old Skool Uber Alles or what-have-you.<br/><br/>The key thing that's missing today for better play, in my opinion, is face-to-face PLAY with people who play differently than you, or who play the way you want to play and can't quite figure out how to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336709/#Comment_336709" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T16:37:51+00:00" title="August  1, 2011  4:37PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2011 4:39PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ugh, no, that (Chris' attempt) is a terrible failure of an attempted solution.  It is as bad as any Rule Zero that has ever existed (HEYYO).<br/><br/>If I Google your game I will reach, at <i>best</i>, a worldwide discussion about your game.<br/><br/>Maybe, maybe, <i>maybe</i> I will be able to find another group playing the game. Probably not, unless it is the Current Edition of D&amp;D and or live in a big city.  <br/><br/>But how do I know if they're any good? What if they are terrible? <br/><br/>Okay, what if they're not terrible, but what interests them about the game is not what interests me about the game?  <br/><br/>All right, let's say they're not terrible, and we're interested in the same thing (or we're able to identify and talk about what interests us in a way that works) - does the GM of that game know how to critique someone's techniques?  How did they learn that?<br/><br/>Let's say they're not terrible, we're interested in the same thing, and the GM of that game is a good critic.  How do I physically set up a session where they can be part of it where it won't be boring for them or disturbing for the rest of my group?  <br/><br/>Let's say all that happens and now I have this critique, how do I implement the critique, how do I put that into practice?<br/><br/>Let's say I put it into practice, how do I know if I did it right?  <br/><br/>What is everyone else at the table doing while I'm learning?<br/><br/>The mechanisms for doing much of this stuff cannot be created by words on a page.  It can only be created by a concerted, real-world organizing effort handled with personal communication, much of it face-to-face.<br/><br/>There's technologies out there that might be put to use - social media of various kinds, map finders like NearbyGamers could be a starting place. I'm sure there's a lot more out there that smarter people can identify.  But words on a page cannot reach this except in the most clumsy way.<br/><br/>When you want to be a better painter or clarinetist or soccer player or World of Warcraft player, you can read books about those things and that can help you to a degree.

This is a really great discussion.  I'm glad I wandered over here today.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a business perspective, I think that JD is spot on when he points out that publishers are in the "text selling" business.  That's how they make their money, and long-term efforts on their part to get people to play their games "better" doesn't appear to have a financial upside.  It's not that they don't care about their players playing well;  instead, they just recognize that the money that feeds their families happens when they write the next game, not when they improve how much fun you're having with the game they already sold you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not a crazy, capitalism is evil argument.  It's a "this is the way the incentives in this industry are built" argument.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't help but wonder if the industry is just missing out.  Think about how many page views a great GM answering questions about GMing could get.  Hits can lead to ad views, and ad views equal money.   Is anyone out there doing this kind of thing?  Are there publishing companies that make it a point to build and nurture a community around their games in a profitable way?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336744/#Comment_336744" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T22:36:01+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 10:36PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have a GM conference of people who run your game, every week, via webcams.

There are many books full of clarinet exercises, for example, which really will help you learn to play the clarinet better. Having a professional instructor spend an hour with you every day will obviously help even more -- especially since they will be able to point you towards the exercises and texts that are best-suited to your particular circumstances -- but that doesn't somehow mean that what you learn from your How To Play The Clarinet book is useless.<br/><br/>I agree with the basic premise -- the fact that we have <i>mostly only</i> texts might be a problem -- but there are tons of good textual learning/teaching tools for RPGs out there, including forum conversations. For example, Judd's old 'you pitch, we bang' threads on RPG net were precisely the sort of 'exercise' that Jason is talking about. And they happened via text, via the Internet, and this did not somehow poison them or make them horrible or anything of the sort.<br/><br/>Tools should not be confused with the medium of their delivery. There could be more mentoring, more direct feedback, more whatever -- but just because something is a YouTube video instead of a written product does not actually mean it is bringing something new and useful to the table.

It's not that they don't care about their players playing well;  instead, they just recognize that the money that feeds their families happens when they write the next game, not when they improve how much fun you're having with the game they already sold you.</blockquote>\nI kind of think a distinction needs to be made from companies like WotC which are quite clearly in it to make money (because it's their corporate mandate), and most of the writer/publishers here on Story Games or in the indie RPG community, who, while I'm sure they enjoy making money and turning a profit, are (I'm equally sure) NOT in it for the money. I really hate to invoke Apocalypse World again in this thread, but have you ever been to the AW forums? There's a lot of conversation going on over there and it's moderated by the game's author/publisher, Vincent Baker. If you're saying that his long-term effort (which he hosts and presumably pays the hosting fees for) to get people to play his games better is invalid (or something else which I can't quite intuit) simply because there's no financial side, well... y'know, I don't actually know how that fits into your argument. I'm pretty sure it doesn't.\n<blockquote>Think about how many page views a great GM answering questions about GMing could get.</blockquote>\nWhich games are you talking about here? Because if you're talking about 4E, there's already an assload of blogs out there addressing exactly that. And if you're talking about ALL the games out there, the scope would be so broad that the chance of any useful advice getting imparted would be almost zero. A site like that would contain pretty much nothing but the generic advice that people above were despairing of (i.e. How to do multiple accents, etc.). Additionally, if you had one person answering questions about all games, the quality of their responses would be lacking, because no one out there would be able to offer comprehensive advice on all rules systems and styles of play. You could hire more people to answer questions, but then you're left with a website where anything is discussed and there's no focus. The people who wanted advice on 4E would be driven off by posts on How We Came to Live Here and the people who were looking for more on How We Came to Live Here would wonder why the website was offering advice on 4E when it's more plentiful and done better elsewhere online. I think that would end up being a colossally bad business model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336750/#Comment_336750" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T23:11:24+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 11:11PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MarkT\u2014the problem then becomes one that circles us all the way around back to the beginning of the discussion.  How do we know this GM is great?  What if he says something that I'm like, "Dude no fucking way, that is terrible GMing advice, I would never do that to my players and would never play with a GM who would do that."<br/><br/>Or are you suggesting someone who is acknowledged as being excellent at GMing a particular game?  That might work better.<br/><br/>I was thinking about the main issue of this thread earlier today, and discussed it a bit with Dave Berg and my roommate.  How do we create a culture of constructive feedback in RPG play?  It's tough but I agree necessary.  I can certainly "be the change I wish to see in the world" on this one and ask for feedback from the people for whom I GM.<br/><br/>But I also want to offer up a slightly different perspective here, too.  I have gotten to the point where I <i>can</i> discuss general GM-craft, more or less and to the extent that such a thing is even possible.  (Although Jesse's point about families of games with certain similarities is certainly well-taken.)  But how did I get there?  I got there by playing and GMing or facilitating literally dozens of genuinely different games across the past 5 years or so.  If a game provides tools that make it really easy to GM (Mouse Guard, 3:16, etc. etc.), you can also gain access to some of those tools when running other things, because you learn good habits of, let's say, scene-framing.  I experienced this a bit when I ran 4E, though not as much as I would have liked: I drew on my experiences running Mouse Guard, PTA, and other things to help my DMing.<br/><br/>So if someone asked me what I think the best way to become a good GM is, I'd say it's to start by GMing or facilitating lots of small, manageable, easy-to-GM games.  PTA is a good choice, for example.  Mouse Guard and 3:16 are high on the list, too. Misspent Youth, perhaps.  (Insert obligatory Lady Blackbird shout-out here.)  As you get more comfortable, start playing things that are a little mechanically heavier.  SotC or AW or Dogs perhaps.  And of course you can tailor the curriculum to your own strengths and interests.  But I think the process of gradually working up to running more complex things could be really useful for a lot of budding GMs.<br/><br/>See, modern trad games (Exalted, 3E, 4E, etc.), and many older ones as well (Vampire, Earthdawn, GURPS 3rd, D&amp;D2, etc.), for all that they may be the "same non-game," are <i>complex</i> just on a sheer mechanical level.  So if you add that factor to the usual social complexities of running a game, well, it's no wonder many people find the prospect of GMing terrifying and many of the people who do it burn out.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336753/#Comment_336753" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-01T23:39:09+00:00" title="August  1, 2011 11:39PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>You would just go with whichever game the person was using, provided the issue wasn't directly tied to the task resolution engine or whatever.

As you say, you get access to all kinds of tools that you can use all over the place, as well as the breadth of experience to inform you about when those tools are appropriate and useful and when they are not.  Even bad, terrible GMing advice starts to become useful at a certain point, because identifying it as something that you would never do means that you know what kinds of things you <i>would</i> do.  Figuring out why some advice is bad (for you) is a huge, huge advantage and makes it easier for you to spot the advice that you would agree with.  (And sometimes, what looks like bad advice is worth trying, just to see whether your own prejudices are blinding you.)<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>The old questions were along the lines of "Which of these hammers is the best for fastening screws?" now people ask "Which tool should I use to fasten screws?".

You may not use every tool in your GM kit in every game, but having all those tools available and knowing when and how to use them (even if it's in a different game, completely unrelated to the one where you first acquired it) is ridiculously useful.  Knowing how to run PTA like a pro certainly won't automagically make you the best D&amp;D4 GM on the block or mean that you can pick up Grey Ranks and run a perfect game sight unseen, but I'd eat every hat I own if you didn't end up using <i>something</i> from your bag of PTA tricks to make your D&amp;D or Grey Ranks games better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336761/#Comment_336761" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T00:51:17+00:00" title="August  2, 2011 12:51AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>I was thinking about the main issue of this thread earlier today, and discussed it a bit with Dave Berg and my roommate.

IIRC, just a weeeee bit before the Forge-theory exploded onto the scene, this was very enthusiastically discussed - and in general principles, that could be applied to any game. Then the whole boom happened, and every discussion of player empowerment either turned into discussion of Forge-theory or (a bit later on) a discussion of which game made player empowerment.<br/><br/>Here is what I think was lost (and this was sort of my original point): in the shockwave of this whole thing, people that weren't interested in Forge-theory or trying out story games were left in the dust, because when the boom came discussions stopped being about how to best make sure players were empowered and became about whether or not it was futile to try to empower players with old style games (sort of like your sophisitical image of hammer and screws, actually.) The craft discussion, the one about how to empower player on the GM or player level of things, gave way to the game theory discussion, about how to best empower players on the design or game purchase side of things.<br/><br/>We lost the craft discussion, which still hasn't picked back up despite the boom quieting down.

If we head over to EN World, rpg.net, or rpggeek (or look at Gnome Stew, or The Alexandrian) we'll find lots of trad gamers, some of whom have little or no interest in game theory discussion. I think that some of the debates on rpg.net are similar problems / questions that trad gamers might have looked at ten or twenty years ago. Just because the discussions over here often pre-suppose that GM craft needs to be hardwired into a system, I think starting a discussion about GM-Craft over on another site would get the system-neutral discussion of how to improve any game. Maybe we've a tendency to think of Forge-theory of some huge revolution in the way <b>everyone</b> thinks about games because it's has a big impact on the way <b>we </b>think about games. Like, I think the discussions are still going on. Apart from the sites I've mentioned above though, I'm not sure where else to go  - but maybe others have better ideas?<br/><br/>Having said that, I can't point to any player-empowerment-in-trad-RPGs threads or blogs post-2006 in a quick look around likely sites, which I guess supports what you're saying.<br/><br/>We might all be being a bit negative about this, though.

much of an impact outside a relatively limited range of people interested in indie games.  Plenty of people play indie games without taking part in the theory conversations on the internet, and I still -- after 10 years of indie RPGs -- still consistently bump into people who've never heard of them at the game store.

There's something else in this subject, but the problem is that this subject can be easily driven into many different solutions that still avoid the problem. <br/><br/>Yes, you can say there are different methods, and there are already a few forums/places and other sources to go to (like film/theater directing)<br/>Yes, there are practices that work better for some groups than for others. You can even go from there into theory, talking about some practices that are better for gamists, narrativists, etc.<br/>Yes, you can tell RPGs have a learning curve and that eventually people either loves them or drops them<br/>And yes, as soon as there are people who find something they like they become gurus of what's right and wrong.<br/><br/>And all that still goes around the problem without finding the opportunity inside it. It has already been mentioned, and business models without vision often fail at seeing it. Perhaps they can do it without it, but it would certainly increase their sales if they could acknowledge how important it is.<br/><br/>It's called "being nice with your clients, and tell them WHY they should buy your product"<br/><br/>It's not as simple as it sounds and believe me or not, this isn't sarcasm. You can actually have a business and good enough sales and still be doing this the wrong way. RPGs have a way to delude their creators into thinking that everybody knows what they are about and why they should be buying it.<br/><br/>And that is because yes, the written texts are completely explicit, rules can be perfectly clear and you can include a lot of play examples with it. Other GMs and players would get it even if it's the most innovative game as long as it has some RPG elements they are familiar with.<br/><br/>But<br/><br/>I'd say that at least 80% of the time (correct me if I'm wrong and please tell me there are precise studies/statistics that prove me wrong) people learn to roleplay by watching other people roleplay.<br/><br/>And since you can't see that more often anywhere, there's still a lot of people who doesn't know a single thing about rpgs. Now there's even rules-lite free games, and it still hasn't become a part of the tradition anywhere in the world. Because the gaming tradition is still being passed from person to person, and all references in popular media are still so obscure a lot of people can't get what it's all about.<br/><br/>Believe or not, those people are customers.<br/><br/>Ok, perhaps you still don't believe I'm talking about the world you live in. It's true, I live in Peru, south america, a place where there are but a few GMs and roleplayers, and cons about RPGs are really few, not to mention production of RPGs is equal to zero so far (I heard rumors about one or two, but haven't find them anywhere and they are probably just D&amp;D hacks with Incas in it)<br/><br/>So let me ramble a bit about how I got into this. It was the mystery. First I found an article in a local newspaper about tabletop RPG, which mentioned Palladium's Robotech (I was a fan of the tv show in that time) and had an example of play. But yet the thing was so cryptic I couldn't make sense of it. I tried to make a boardgame out of what I could understand, but it was useless. Years later I finally stumbled on a group playing D&amp;D in a club but I couldn't interrupt the session to bother them with my questions. On top of that I didn't knew anybody in the group so I went back to my home still clueless... but more interested.<br/><br/>And then I meet a player of Vampire the Masquerade. He told me about his character and adventures, explained a bit more of the system and finally took me to his group for a session. That's when I finally learned what was all about, and yet I still had to discover a lot more about the rules and relaxing a bit and enjoying the game. So it took me like 6 years to finally get into RPGs.<br/><br/>Now compare this to your own experience. How many of you learned it all from a book? How many had to explain how this game is fun to a group of skeptical players? How many videos of people playing and having a good time are in Youtube?<br/><br/>And this all comes to the "being nice with your clients, and tell them WHY they should buy your product" part. To succesfully sell a product, you engrave emotions on it. Call it "fun" and "innovative" is not enough these days, you have to explain a bit more. And particulary about tabletop RPGs you have to SHOW a lot more. You know why there's this explosion of narrative gaming? because stories have a nice way to compel emotions from the audience, and thus games promoted that way look like they are more likely fun than games with more complex rules and a gamist orientation. <br/><br/>For those who haven't try or are scared of them, actually you can also have tons of fun with gamey RPGs. But it's a bit cryptic until you get the rules and objective or the game. No system (gamist, narrative, etc) is particularily better than other, it's just the way it's promoted and the people who promote it. (No offense, but it's my imagination or there are more charismatic storytellers than charismatic gamers in the RPG world?)<br/><br/>Sorry for being this rude so far, but IMHO this initiative is not only neccesary but it can be profitable. RPGs are still a business model where the product (at least in one neccessary stage) is explained from person to person, so who's better to promote it than a person who actually had a good playing experience with it?. Selling text is our business, doing everything we can to explain why it should be bought is STILL selling text. Forums, cons, videos, door to door sales, anything. Sure you can have a good enough business being lazy about it, but if you really want to be competitive, you can do this and go ahead of people who aren't doing it yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336812/#Comment_336812" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T09:55:10+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  9:55AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

Your initial post here was thought-provoking. <br/><br/>But this is a forum not overly eager to discuss GM-ship. The cool new story-stuff is at the forefront of the brains here. To have serious debates on GMing you may have to make a whole new forum, with people eager to deepen their understanding of GMing, and to better themselves both by praxis and discussion. I would like to see that. I love modern rpgs, even some of them with focus on story rather than character, but my hearth still beats a bit extra for the really great classical game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336856/#Comment_336856" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T13:26:08+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  1:26PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2011 1:30PM by Jocelyn Robitaille.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: TomasHVM</cite>But this is a forum not overly eager to discuss GM-ship. </blockquote>\nIt's funny, because a couple of days ago, I would've never thought about posting my thoughts on the disparition of best practice discussions here.<br/><br/>Here's what brought me to this point: I started a thread asking about Story Before / Now / After, and as an aside commented the terms and their meaning reminded me a bit of a way I had of prepping one-shots. While my link between my method and the terms turned out to be faulty, a couple of people mentionned they would be interested in me starting a thread about my method. I did start a thread, expecting very few replies since this was basically a long chunk of text about how I built one-shot scenarios for <i>traditional</i> RPGs. Much to my surprise, a lot of people responded, and pretty much everyone was excited about the topic itself, and a couple of people expressed that they'd be interested in reading more discussions of that kind.<br/><br/>That brought me to posting my thoughts on the topic of why these discussions are rarer today than they used to be, because (a) some people seemed interested in best practice discussions and (b) a lot of people seem to be interested in the industry and its evolution.

My claim that "GM craft" is dead in that sense is definitely an overstatement. It's the conversations on the topic - or at least on the topic involving GMing in general and not how to best use a specific system - that have died down.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: Valamir</cite>I definitely think its interesting.

It leaves people who are only interested in traditional RPGs in the dust. For better or for worse, the play experience provided by story games and traditional RPGs often feel very different from one another. And there are still gamers who are not interested in the play experience that story games produce*. The disparition of traditional GM craft discussions means that the space for those gamers to think about player empowerment, narrative control, what to make of failure, etc. is gone. Sure, they could follow the evolution and try story games to challenge their way of thinking - but it's unfair to ask people to do something they find unfun in order to better their fun at something they find fun.<br/><br/>So yes, I do recognize the evolution. All I'm saying that it's a shame that the spawning of that evolution basically muted the old version long enough that it is now almost voiceless.<br/><br/>*And yes, I know, the play experiences provided by story games vary wildly from one another.

Or if there is, it exists at only a very, very high level: group facilitation, dispute mediation, pacing (maybe, arguably, although even pacing means something different depending on the game...maybe "pacing sensitivity" in a very broad sense), being sensitive to what matters to the participants in any given stretch of play. Or simply being sensitive to your participants, i.e. not being a self-absorbed douche. And then we've exceeded "GM Craft" and entered "how to be a decent human being" territory.<br/><br/>I'm not at all persuaded that much, if anything, more specific than that can be lumped into general "GM Craft." <br/><br/>Some indie/story/Forgey games can teach trad GMs useful things. Burning Wheel taught me to make every roll's failure relevant and explicit, for example: That's a neat trick that maps from BW over to pretty much anything in the trad mold...although even as I write this, I can think of exceptions to the "explicit" clause.<br/><br/>Until someone comes up with a non-vague, non-bullshit "this is what a GM is responsible for" definition that is broadly applicable to every GMed game, the premise of the discussion is flawed.<br/><br/>Possible conclusion from this that makes me sad: It is entirely possible that there are many, many folks out there whose GMing would benefit more from becoming better human beings than from learning how to frame a conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336875/#Comment_336875" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T14:57:35+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  2:57PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mean why I'd rather have advice for specific games rather than generic?<br/><br/>The simple answer:  system matters.  Tips and tricks for adding spice to your 4E campaign would be largely non portable and possibly outright destructive to a Technoir game.  Some of them may well be portable to an Apocalypse World campaign but most would need to be modified to address AW's specific play paradigm.<br/><br/><br/>Now some very high level advice can port fairly universally across many games at a fairly high level...like say "How to make your NPCs interesting" but:<br/><br/>1) Not always.  NPCs in Smallville for example serve a very specific very defined purpose in that game...to be Wedges between PCs highlighting their drives and relationships.  Applying generic "make your NPCs interesting" advice may very well not make for good Smallville NPCs<br/><br/>2) "How to make your NPCs interesting" advice is all well and good...but even better is taking that to the next level of demonstrating how to use them in THIS particular game.  For instance in some games (like say DragonAge) you can get away with NPCs who are very abbreviated in terms of stats.  In other games you'll want your NPCs to be almost as fully statted out as the PCs.  In some games there's a very different play process of how people at the table interact with each other and this can definitely impact when and how to use NPCs effectively (contrast say a game of OD&amp;D using a party caller with Sorcerer).<br/><br/>Now it may be true that GM advice that works for running a GURPS campaign also ports well to Rune Master or AD&amp;D or Shadow Run or other "traditional" games, but I suspect that it doesn't port nearly so well as is commonly assumed.  I think even such traditional games would benefit from GM Craft advice that's specific to the game itself.<br/><br/><br/>But in the end I think gone are the days when every new game is essentially the same game just with differents rule for calculating encomberance or determining initiative order.  And therefor gone are the days where one-size-fits-all advice works effectively. And that's a Good Thing IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336878/#Comment_336878" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T15:09:45+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  3:09PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2011 3:13PM by Robert_Bohl.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My problem with this whole thread is that the notion of "GMship" creates an artificial separation between so-called GMed and so-called GMless games. <br/><br/>Not to mention the presumption that there's a sensible notion of what a GM is, absent context from any given game.<br/><br/>There are <i>n</i> players playing a game.

If you acknowledge that players who are open to the whole story-games thing are in fact still having these conversations -- which you apparently do -- but are mostly concerned about all the 'traditional gamers' who aren't willing to participate in any conversation framed in terms of the new culture... then presumably the change you want to see in the world involves going to rpg.net or the ENWorld boards and starting conversations there, devoid of the new culture jargon so that the traditional players (or I guess, GMs, since the players aren't the issue) will participate.<br/><br/>If on the other hand the goal is to argue that such a thing has occured, well, again, many of the people here aren't really going to be in a great position to see it -- because, as has been established, they're still having these conversations all the time, just in a culturally-different format. Like, just a few weeks ago I engaged in a long series of conversations about how to GM Technoir, because I am running a Technoir game, so if you tell me that nobody talks about "GM craft" anymore my immediate response is 'but I just did'.<br/><br/>Personally it surprises me to hear that rpg.net and such places don't have these sort of conversations -- what in god's name do they talk about, if not how to play games better?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336894/#Comment_336894" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T16:45:21+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  4:45PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are OSR folks not having these types of discussions on OSR-focused forums?

(Also I would like discussions about group "playing-craft")</blockquote>\nI agree with both of these, and I'd add that to me there's not much difference between game-specific gm- and player-craft and the generic variety:  as far as I'm concerned, I take <i>everything</i> I learn about <i>every game I play</i> and carry it to whatever the next game I play is.  If I try something that I learned in an earlier game and it works in a new one, I'm awesome and I've learned something; if I try it and it bombs, then I'm not going to do that again in that game but <i>I've still learned something</i>.  That's part of the fun, and I think an essential part of improving any skill: to take what you learned in one context and see how it applies (or if it applies) in a new one.  And more to the point, in a way, I treat all online discussion as generic: it's not specifically about <i>my</i> gaming group and what we do, which is the only kind of specificity that really counts in the end.<br/><br/><br/>The real problem I have with game-specific discussions is that if it's not a game I want to know more about, I'm probably going to skip it and might miss something that I would have wanted to know.  That's on me, though.  I could definitely read threads about things I don't think I'm going to be all that interested in, but I just don't, and it might very well be my loss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336905/#Comment_336905" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T18:15:28+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  6:15PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2011 6:19PM by Cedric P.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Often I find it more useful to have read gaming-craft about a specific game (instead of general stuff) because when I have to apply what I have learned to a other game I can consider from where the technique come and in what context it was used.<br/><br/> So when something don't work, I can consider the difference between the context it was advised for VS the the context I am trying to actually use it in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336907/#Comment_336907" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T18:31:45+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  6:31PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, this thread has clearly exploded in a number of directions.<br/><br/>I can't help but think that if (IF!) gamers are no longer discussing "generic" or "trad" GM advice, there must be some reason for it. Do you think the masses at large have been quieted down by the indie game revolution?<br/><br/>Anyone can go to any forum (including this one, or the Forge) and say, "Here's my awesome GM advice!" Or perhaps, "Help me run my D&amp;D game better!"<br/><br/>If there are fewer people doing so, there must be some reason they are no longer driven to do so. Because, if they still are, nothing is stopping them.<br/><br/>So, if (IF!) there is indeed less of this kind of discussion going on, what are the possible reasons?<br/><br/>I might guess:<br/><br/>* Some of those seeking advice to make their D&amp;D games better had desires that were really much better satisfied by new, different games, so they've gravitated towards playing those games instead. If the games are satisfying ENOUGH, they are no longer on the internet asking for that kind of advice. And if they are looking for advice, they might be so turned off by their prior unsatisfying experiences with trad games, that they have no interest in them anymore. <br/><br/>(I see lots of people in this boat: the, "I don't play anything except indie/story games anymore" people.)<br/><br/>* Some of those seeking that advice were simply misguided. They sought anything that would improve their gaming. All the advice they found happened to be along the lines of things that didn't really help them. For instance, consider how someone desperately yearning for deeply personal angsty drama might not be well-served by advice on how to best do an Irish accent for your Dwarves. But they didn't know what else they could change, so they kept looking for that kind of advice. When the field broadened, the discussions became more varied, those people realized they were better served by other discussions, not the ones they engaged in before.<br/><br/>In other words, my theory is that a lot of the people discussing traditional "GM craft" weren't actually as interested in it as they thought:<br/><br/>They happily found that other changes in their gaming brought about the improvement they desired, and they dropped out of those conversations.<br/><br/>I don't know how right I am--I'm just thinking out loud, really--but I do suspect it's at least a small part of the picture.<br/><br/>However, fundamentally, I don't think this has changed as much as this thread is making it out to have. It's just that the, "Here's how I'm an awesome GM!" threads are now called, "Here's my set of tricks for running PTA". <br/><br/>It may seem different, but it isn't really. The reader still has to read the advice, then decide whether it's applicable to whatever it is their gaming is like, and then try it and see if it gives them what they want.<br/><br/>If anything, having an awareness of different gaming styles makes it far easier for me to guess which advice might be useful for me and which might not. In the pre-Forge days GM advice was very "hit or miss": you read something, maybe it sounds cool, maybe it sounds like the opposite of what I want out of gaming. Now I feel like I get more out of reading that advice, because I have a better idea of what happens in a D&amp;D4E game versus an OSR game, versus a personal character drama jeepform.<br/><br/>The field has broadened, become more diffuse and grown in different directions. Of course there's less advice and discussion out there that directly applies to every gamer and every game all at the same time!<br/><br/>In the "old days", the thread about how to structure one-shots would have been read by everyone. Today, it is still interesting. But if the games I play are Dogs in the Vineyard and Zombie Cinema and Kagematsu... I'm not going to comment in the thread. Because those games already have their own solutions to that problem. So, there's one less person participating in that discussion. Hypothetical me will start a thread about making the coolest Dogs town... because that's what I need to make my game on Saturday awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336909/#Comment_336909" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T18:42:41+00:00" title="August  2, 2011  6:42PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see  a list of best practices of GM-craft for traditional games being a bit like a gateway drug to indie story games.

I wanted to say, 'that's way cool.'  But i think there's a lot there to be discussed (new thread?).<br/><br/><b>A comparison:</b>  I work for a print shop.  I have been to four colleges.  I have no degree to speak of.  At one college i took a lot of art courses.  I saw my friends taking the color-theory classes, and i said 'that looks like shit, i'm not doing it.'  So i skipped all those classes.  Fast forward ten years, i'm working at a print shop *in the color department.*  I says to myself 'crap, i should have taken them color classes.  This shit makes no sense.'  I ask my friends who <i>did</i> take said classes for help.  They can't help me.<br/><br/>Turns out working in the world of digital press has ZERO EDUCATION to actually back it up, ninety nine percent is just fumbling around till it works.  No joke.  I researched my job and found that the only courses offered are literally tangential at best.  And the only people that can teach you are people that have actually been doing it forever.  There's text out there to read, but mentorship is only gonna happen face to face.  Crap this is getting long - the point:  Playing and Running RPGs is like working in a Color Department.  You can get a degree in Acting, or Writing, or Social Services and that's all applicable, but it's not the CRAFT.  It's tangential at best.  <br/><br/><b>Where are we doing this shit?</b><br/>We have no schools that teach RPG anything.  We have no mentorship or networking beyond Skyping and Forums.  This is a bummer.  Add to that how quickly the concept of the Game Store is vanishing because of cheaper sales and better selection on the Internet...now where do we <i>meet?</i>  We have no mentorship, we have no real networking, and we can only get together at bars and diners.  (okay, maybe i'm not complaining about that so much.  Diners = awesome).<br/><br/>As a result we're applying a hell of a lot of 'Color Theory and Drawing Human Anatomy' to solve 'Print Shop' problems (i'm still in the metaphor, shit!).  The evolution of theory beginning with 'how to be a GM,' turning into 'how to understand gaming,' and then 'what games do whatnow?' is all part of the floundering attempt to have any kind of community.<br/><br/><b>An Aside about Organization</b><br/>And just to muddy the waters a bit more, maybe that's a good thing?  I mean, i kinda hated everything about higher education.  It seemed to produce more people with shitty, condescending opinions than it did people with love for any kind of art.  It was a place to teach you how to shit on things (but that's my super-cynical opinion, i understand if you hate me now).  Right now the world of StoryGaming is free.  The upside is that we don't have the same old shit being handed down to us in a cannon of forced opinions.  The downside is we still don't really know how to help each other figure out what we like and don't like, and we end up in shitty games.<br/><br/><b>Another Analogy using Tools</b><br/>I don't know what we're supposed to be talking about, Games or GM technique.  But i know there's a cool art to taking Stat+Skill and telling an awesome story that might die with the invention of Storygames.  Good, bad?  I don't know.  The tool analogy to me is kinda like AW is a powersaw.  And Anima Prime is a blowtorch.  And Burning Wheel is something with a bunch of levels and buttons and powercords that you actually have to read the manual to know how to work it, and it leaves you going, "oh, man, i can do *that*? with this thing...awesome."<br/><br/>But we all still like to watch those shows where the guy with the lambchops and bushy mustache shows us how to build a barn with just a hacksaw and a hammer.  And you feel a bit like there's some serious, magical fucking *craft* to that shit.  You kinda wish you had your own show on PBS where you built a barn with nothing but some Stats and a set of generic Skills.  Make that gas-powered Burning Wheel guy look like a ten dollar construction worker.<br/><br/>It's a trade off.  It's a thing.  I've lost my point.

You are talking from the standpoint of your own tradition, which is, as seen from Norway, a bit narrow in this respect. The methodology of game mastership is founded on general principles of leadership, group dynamics, improvisation, dialogue and narration. <br/><br/>Most of it is located in the field of dialogue techniques, which is sadly ignored by the vast majority of both classical and modern role-playing games. There are simple tools to be learned, based on general principles of human psychology and group dynamics, which will help you elevate the game-play of any classical role-playing game, and which will do much to open your eyes to how a modern GM-free game may be designed for a much softer kind of role-playing.<br/><br/>I just held a four day workshop on game mastering, and did so with next to no references to any particular system. I had no need to make the workshop deal with specific games, other than saying what is obvious; the general principles of game mastering applies to all classical games. The ones participating there had no problem seeing that this would help them mastering the craft of leading small groups in creative endeavors, and especially the craft of leading small groups in dialogue-based role-playing games. All of them said that the workshop really had helped them be better game masters. And this was game masters from a great variety of classical games (some of the games I did not know at all).<br/><br/>My background for holding such a workshop, is 17 years of professional game mastership. More than 2500 game sessions sold and paid for (up to eight paying groups each week). Nearly two decades of developing my own classical game, <b>Fabula</b> (published in 1999, in its 8th version), with a growing focus on working out a better balance in resolution mechanics and dialogue techniques. It has made me realise that a game do not have a <i>system</i>, it has a <b>method</b> (in which the <i>system</i> may be said to refer to the mechanical side of it).<br/><br/>But it all started back in 1989, when I had the game <b>Muu</b> revealed to me, in a nightly spell that may be described as a shamanistic journey. It was a game so bereft of all trappings connected to rpg's of the time, that it opened my eyes to a whole new field of the rpg-methodology; the field of dialogue techniques. I did not understand the game fully, and had no way of setting the insights and dialogue-tools of it to paper, so it was sold solely through full-day courses in how to be a "muu-leader".<br/><br/>Since then a lot has changed. A lot of Norwegian games has seen the light of day. The influence of the field of dialogue-techniques is evident in them. I believe it is very important in our understanding of how the special trappings of <i>Norwegian dialogue-based role-playing</i> design developed, and possibly the special developments in <i>Nordic live action role-playing</i> too.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>...there is no such thing as "GM Craft" in the general sense. Or if there is, it exists at only a very, very high level: ...</blockquote>Good, general GM craft certainly enables you to lead games on a very high level. <br/><br/>However; the tools needed to do so is, in fact, very simple and straightforward, once you've learned where to look for them; in the field of dialogue techniques. That is actually what people of your culture, like Jocelyn, do too, when they explore and develop the craft of game mastering.<br/><br/>But they have little or no "cultural capital" in your gaming-culture. The American school of though is heavily focused on the <i>mechanical</i> side of rpg-design, to the detriment of the <i>technique</i> side of it. This is evident in both classical (with GM) and modern (no GM) role-playing games. There are little design work done in the field of techniques, in your game-culture, and so it is easy for you to discard thoughts on techniques as irrelevant, or even: non-existent.<br/><br/>But it will not do. The blindness of claiming that a very important field of the rpg-methodology is non-existent, cannot be maintained. You will, eventually, have to open your eyes and travel into the great field of dialogue techniques. To be able to develop the proud tradition of game design further, we all have to do this. The methodology inherent in role-playing games will, eventually, demand it of all rpg-designers. It is simple; role-playing games like ours are <i>dialogue based</i>, so to ignore the evident <i>dialogue techniques</i> of it; how they may be mastered and put to use, is not something we may do forever. Role-playing games of the future will come to be designed with the full methodology of the field in mind.<br/><br/>The craft of game mastering you are invited to discuss in this thread, is situated in the tick of dialogue techniques, as applied to classical games. And a lot of it certainly applies to modern games too, where no GM is present. It has the power to inform your design of classical <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> modern role-playing games, and make you are better schooled designer all over.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_336934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336934/#Comment_336934" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-02T23:11:36+00:00" title="August  2, 2011 11:11PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2011 11:16PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Inspired by the post of Andrew "Greyspawn" Henderson:</i><br/>There's this guy digging a swimming pool with a stick.

Running (and playing) RPGs is (I believe) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge" rel="nofollow">tacit knowledge</a>. Like surfing or speaking a language, you won't learn it by reading about it, but by doing it. Reading can help, and watching other people do it will help even more, but nobody can explicitly explain and write down a clear set of instructions for it.<br/><br/>2. Different games (as in <i>game texts</i>, or <i>rulesets</i>) require different techniques, approaches and tricks. A particular set of advice might be great for one game but terrible for another. There's also the question of different groups, tastes, playstyles and social environments. A set of advice that works with a specific ruleset for one group of people might not work with the same ruleset and a different group of people (and vice versa).<br/><br/>3. The above makes it very very difficult to create any sort of great "GM Craft" bible or whatever. There are lots of people who've tried (and succeeded!) in making great GM advice books (Play Unsafe et. all), but they're hardly universal or infallible. I agree with 95% of what JDCorley has been saying in this thread. The question then obviously becomes how do we talk about GM Craft in any useful or productive way? We can't establish any real discipline or write a manual. We can just talk. Talk talk talk talk. Talk and do. And isn't that what we are doing anyway, at least some of our time. Trying to get better, playing, learning, talking to other people about it, asking questions, listening to panels, etc.<br/><br/>[Aside: I love to "research" the practical side of gaming, I want to learn, I want to get better. Which is why I wanted to start a podcast dedicated to the practicalities of GMing, and we had a pretty good skype discussion for it with Tavis Allison, John Stavropolous and Jason Corley, sadly my recording software was shit and fucked up the audio. I want to get back to it but (a) I've been very busy these past few months (b) I need to get better equipment and (c) I'm in Europe and the majority of internet gamers I know are from the other side of the pond so it's also a scheduling nightmare. But I promise I'll pick it up again as soon as I can.]<br/><br/>4. In light of the above I'm slightly confused as to why "story gamers" would be disinclined to have this conversation (or these conversations, rather). Barring Shreyas' ideological wedge and Thomas' rather hasty and generalizing assessment that "this is a forum not overly eager to discuss GM-ship" (two posts among many [also, it's not like Story Games is this immutable bastion of conviction or whatever, I've seen it mutate several times over the years, and who knows where we'll sail next]) there certainly seems both interest and willingness to discuss these things. On other sites, too, ENWorld has quite a lot of GM Craft talk for example. The OSR is 25% about DIY content, 25% about archeology and 50% about GMing tricks and techniques. I think Chris Perkins is doing a pretty good job of discussing GM Craft on his <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4dmxp/20110623" rel="nofollow">The Dungeon Master Experience</a> column (and there are countless 4E DM blogs out there). So I agree with those who say that this supposed Death of GM craft via Forge (or whatever) never really happened or rather that its influence was very limited. There's a lot of discussion going on, all the time. If anything, I think what happened with "forge" games in the last ten years is that designers attempted to incorporate their specific techniques, their actual play, their craft into the game text itself, integrate it into the rules themselves. But as Jason said, it's still just a text. <br/><br/>Also, what is Sorcerer &amp; Sword but page upon page of GM advice on how to run a sword &amp; sorcery game, largely applicable across different systems, with zero crunchy bits (with a D&amp;D supplement you'd get a bunch of prestige classes, feats and magic items, otherwise what's the point?)? And yet, lots of people don't know how to play Sorcerer at all (because it's a text), which is why Christopher Kubasik is writing Play Sorcerer (another text).<br/><br/>5. So, as far as I'm concerned: do we need to talk about GM Craft more? Yes. Do we have to nurture and teach and share and mentor? Yes! Do we have to listen and learn? Yes! <br/><br/>But do we have to do this because we somehow haven't been doing it, or because the discussion was dead, so we have to do it again? I'd venture a bold <i>no</i>. The discussion is and was always there, it's just never-ending and non-progressive, because there isn't a way to record and codify it to a satisfying degree (points 1, 2, 3 above).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaochou" title="chaochou"><img alt="chaochou" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaochou">chaochou</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336948/#Comment_336948" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T04:51:42+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  4:51AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This might be tangential, but has anyone mentioned podcasting yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, it's not like mentoring or discussion but I find listening to an AP of a game I'm thinking of running interesting. Irrespective of whether I think the session is 'good' or not you can just listen in on another GM running the same game as you, see the way they frame scenes or what questions they ask or what they choose to describe in detail and what gets left out. No one forces you to learn anything from it, but it's a resource that's out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of 'GM craft' I think Narrative Control focuses almost exclusively on ideas, advice and discussion of GM-craft and player-craft.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336949/#Comment_336949" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T05:51:18+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  5:51AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by Paul T.</cite>Can you tell me more about this?

It's been years so it's hard to remember exactly, but I wouldn't call it "lost wisdom", because pretty much every notion that was discussed then is now found in a lot of story games today. Things like "playing the town", "letting it ride", "flags", player input on the fiction, etc. (I'm using quotations marks because the concepts were discussed, but not in those terms.) My point here is that this wisdom, which used to be discussed among traditional RPG gamers, is now almost exclusively the realm of story games discussions. So that wisdom is lost to gamers who might have been interested in those ideas but have no interest in trying out story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336950/#Comment_336950" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T06:16:50+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  6:16AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I understand your point a lot better now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336953/#Comment_336953" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T07:36:08+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  7:36AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it's a matter of venue?

Way upthread, I said that the discussion that comes from indie design is antithetical to GM-craft discussions, and I think that's true (though I also think I overstated my case.)<br/><br/>You can talk about how games do these things with their rules, with baked-in content.  And you can talk about how to get the most out of your game without rules shifts, with table practices.  The same people can have, and value, both conversations.  I do; I'd be stunned if anyone here <i>didn't</i>.<br/><br/>But talking about both <i>at the same time</i> doesn't work well.  And most of the venues we have online <i>trend</i> to one or the other pole of discussion, so that it's easier to have the one conversation there, but harder to have the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336957/#Comment_336957" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T08:00:12+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  8:00AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I mean, no matter what you call it, if you're incorporating Let It Ride, r-maps, flags, etc., into your games, you're doing "indie" stuff even if you publicly reject the Forge and post-Forge movement.<br/><br/>And I think that's the real problem at the heart of this thread: it's pretty much impossible to discuss general GM-craft without venturing into territory that involves indie techniques.  So even though many gamers either don't know "our" games or even outright reject them, their influence is much wider than can be measured by the number of people who have a copy of Polaris on their shelf.  I mean, look at 4E D&amp;D!  It's <i>heavily</i> influenced by indie games, <i>especially</i> the GM advice.<br/><br/>So basically, if there are hordes of trad gamers out there who want to improve their play but have technical agendas that preclude them from adopting a couple of basic, solid indie techniques\u2014fuck 'em.  Seriously.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.  Let them continue to complain on rpgnet about how their players "won't take the game seriously" or can't remember the names of NPCs or how this one guy who knows the system better than everyone else completely steamrolls during combats.  There are real solutions to those problems, but you may have to compromise on some of your assumptions.  That's life.<br/><br/>I mean, there certainly are people within the trad camp who peddle GM advice.  Tracy Hickman tried to sell me <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14395.phtml" rel="nofollow">this</a> at GenCon in '09.  I flipped through it and it seemed like just the same old encouragement for GM's to bring the magic and hide their railroading with funny voices and misdirection.  In other words, trad GM advice.  I thanked him and walked away.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336958/#Comment_336958" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T08:05:38+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  8:05AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>So it's a matter of venue?

So even though many gamers either don't know "our" games or even outright reject them, their influence is much wider than can be measured by the number of people who have a copy of Polaris on their shelf.</blockquote>\nAh, but see, here's the thing. Those techniques and notions? They were being discussed prior to the "indie" boom. The fact that in everyone's minds - trad and story gamers alike - they have become <i>your</i> techniques is all messed up. <br/><br/>This is exactly what I'm bemoaning, here: that discussion of these way to approach RPGs has stopped in trad-only circles. These are things that can make your gaming better, no matter what sub-set of RPGs you're talking. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by Paul B</cite>The trad fora often show themselves to be actively hostile to discussions that challenge the orthodoxy.</blockquote>\nIMHO, this is mainly due to the fact that along the way, we sort of forgot how to challenge traditional RPGs orthodoxy while respecting their essential structure. And by we, I mean gamers at large. In the days of the Forge-theory boom and the rise of story games, enthusiasm was such that somehow these became <i>the</i> way to challenge orthodoxy. The thing is, that movement was pretty much the first one to have a defined set of ideas, so it came across with a resounding voice, either converting or drowning out all the other more individual notions about unorthodox best practices. When the boomed died out, the other POVs were sort of forgotten, because they hadn't mean organised in a body of knowledge like Forge-theory was.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure challenges to orthodox trad gaming practices would be more welcome in trad fora if these challenges were about how to make the trad RPG play experience more fun instead of being about making them more like story games. The thing is, I'm not so sure we even know how to word such challenges anymore, or how to stick to the essence of trad games.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by Mark W</cite> To some degree, "theory" and "technique" or even any serious attempt to understand craft and process in a systematic as opposed to experiental way has become associated with a particular (largely non-existent except as a convenient label) faction in RPG-land, the dreaded "Story Gamer" or "Forgie".<br/><br/>Therefore, those with a strong identity-attachment to being "traditional" in their gaming have tended to reject all such discussion.

During the boom, some people became... overenthusiastic, to say the least. As with any theory, there was a period where a lot of people fell to the temptation of treating it as a kind of revelation, meant to be acknowledged as truth by everyone. A lot of people tried to continue discussing craft and theory outside of the Forge body of ideas when the Forge-boom came about, but these discussions kept getting swarmed by posts about how Forge theory was better, and about how people who want to better their gaming should just adhere to it. This happened over and over again, to the point where you could quite reliably bet on the fact that any theory or unorthodox craft discussion would turn into discussions about either the importance of Forge theory, or the proper use of its terminology to discuss things. Eventually, the only reliable way to discuss about traditional RPGs was to make sure no theory entered it, or to try to disguise it as much as you could.<br/><br/>In truth, I think this is exactly how the best practices discussions died out, and how we lost the words to discuss unorthodox best practices in traditional RPGs. I also don't think it's anyone's fault directly. This is just the way people react to new paradigms, and the reason why what came before drowned out is because what came before wasn't a coherent paradigm, but a multitude of individual views, some of which intersected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336973/#Comment_336973" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T09:46:45+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  9:46AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mostly agree with your thesis.

The OSR doesn't even really seem to address this. It sure seems like one of those what-is-porn things (I know it when I see it).<br/><br/>I don't even know if anyone has nailed down what "story game" actually entails.<br/><br/>Once again everything falls apart when it comes to definitions, and everyone retreats to their silos. <br/><br/>Is discussing a character's capabilities and discerning which of them are flags or anti-flags useful for making trad games more fun, or does that make the process too story-game-like? <br/><br/>Is doodling up a relationship map of the PCs, NPCs and various organizations/factions/nations useful for trad gaming, or does the taint of story-game cling to the technique?<br/><br/>If you drift Pathfinder so that every given roll's result sticks until the situation changes, are you now playing Burning Wheel?<br/><br/>If a WoD GM spends some time before a scene starts up to clarify what each character wants out of it, is it now a story game?<br/><br/>Is ensuring that there's something personally at stake for the PCs in your big tactical battle just indie-Forgey faggotry? &lt;-- Absolutely true story from my FLGS, in reaction to a dungeon master whining to the shop owner that he doesn't know how to make his fights "interesting" any more. This was his reaction when I tried to move the conversation away from "interesting = new tactical challenges."<br/><br/>I know, for sure, that enough folks have thrown that reaction in my face over the years on various fora that I no longer have any interest in bringing it up there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336975/#Comment_336975" name="Item_97" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T10:03:35+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 10:03AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm basically in alignment with you here, Jocelyn.  I would just add to address some of the "why here?" questions it's that for us gamers who tend towards traditional style of play, we don't really have a general forum with a wide audience to discuss these things anymore.  rpg.net is not bad, but the Tangency rot and excessive commercialism have weakened the quality of the discussions (though there are still some very good threads to read there from time to time).  Everywhere else is either very regional or attached to a specific system.  Though system-specific advice is helpful, it tends (as people have pointed out) to be of the mechanical variety (and that holds true for the entire spectrum).<br/><br/>Storygames holds a lot of promise because the audience is widespread and there are a lot of very intelligent, curious, interested and experienced games here.  The problem is there is also this dogma (thankfully slowly lessening) that basically reminds you that your perspective doesn't count (saying stupid shit like "all games before indie games were the same" or branding all innovative techniques as "indie techniques" in this very thread are prime examples of this).<br/><br/>So I think Jocelyn sees some of that promise here and is trying to find a constructive way to address those of you who are already evolving beyond the mind-forged manacles of trad vs. indy and finding a new avenue of discussion that will encompass where we are going without cutting out where we came from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336976/#Comment_336976" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T10:09:57+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 10:09AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2011 10:10AM by Jocelyn Robitaille.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's really funny, <b>Paul B.</b>, because <i>every</i> example you used are things that I did in my games after reading these ideas in "best practices" discussions <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> the Forge boom. (Not in the actual trad games you used as examples, but in trad games nonetheless.) And they really did make my gaming better, too.<br/><br/>This is actually why I think it's useful to go back on the history of these ideas and how they were present in trad games discussions prior to the Forge-boom. I think one of the way they can be reclaimed as stuff to think about for the hobby as a whole is to make light on the fact that these are not in fact "indie techniques" (to use Deliverator's term), but techniques that have heavily influenced "indie" game design.<br/><br/>And you're right that now that the dust has settled, the best way to restore balance to the force might just be to define what's the essence of a trad game, what's the essence of a story game, and what potentially belongs in both subsets. I know this has been done tons of times already, but I think this has yet to be done in a descriptive manner, devoid of value judgements of any kind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336977/#Comment_336977" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T10:10:46+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 10:10AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2011 11:18AM by Cedric P.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite><br/>Is discussing a character's capabilities and discerning which of them are flags or anti-flags useful for making trad games more fun, or does that make the process too story-game-like?</blockquote>\nI once tried on Roludo, a local forum having amateurs of both trad &amp; story games (where me Jocelyn and WalkerP participate), to discuss flags in Unknowns Armies (the stimulis, etc) but nearly no one participated in the discussion. On one side I was told that I was trying to stoygamise too much my gameplay experience (Someone even joked that I should go to a storygame deprogrammation clinic) and on the other side I was told that what I was talking about was general common sense and that everyone was already doing this without needing to name it or to identify it as a technique so that there was no real point about discussing this. I admit that I was a little clumsy in how I started the discussion because it showed that my interest about flags came from storygames, but this discussion was a big deception for me since I was super enthusiast to talk about gm/player craft for a traditional game but it din't went well (I felt dismissed).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

for the PCs in your big tactical battle just indie-Forgey faggotry? &lt;-- Absolutely true story from my FLGS, in reaction to a dungeon master whining to the shop owner that he doesn't know how to make his fights "interesting" any more. This was his reaction when I tried to move the conversation away from "interesting = new tactical challenges."&lt;/p&gt;</blockquote>\nThis example is the threadwinner, to me.<br/><br/>Jocelyn, I don't think you're wrong at all about the <i>reason why</i> these kinds of things happen\u2014this body of techniques became associated with a somewhat-specific, somewhat-unified body of theory and games and was thus tainted.  Rather than simply being some things that some crazy innovative GMs were trying at their own tables.<br/><br/>(You're certainly right about some of these techniques emerging before the Forge movement formally got underway.  I stumbled on a few of them myself while running D&amp;D3.0 in college.  But I never developed my GM craft with any <i>reliability</i> until I started running lots of Forge-derived games.)<br/><br/>That said, I think it is possible to throw ideas out there in a non-jargon-y, non-Forge-y, non-scary way and have people listen.

The context of the discussion you're mentionning is pretty important. We were at the start of a campaign, and even though we held a session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%230&amp;Mode=like">#0</a> to discuss our expectations (which you missed because you hadn't joined yet), people at the table had obviously very different and sometimes conflicting expectations about how the game should unfold. This issue was - for me anyway - very central to the discussion thread you're refering to. I think when we had it, both of us and others too were still at the stage of trying to find out if we could get <i>that particular campaign</i> to fit our expectations. Hence, that discussion was more along the lines of "I think we should use the system like this" - "No, I think it should be used like that.", and so on.<br/><br/>Honestly, I can't speak for others, but if you were to ask the same question today without having at stake an actual campaign around which misunderstandings were playing out, you'd have very different answers from me. Likewise, if this is a discussion we would've had during session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%230&amp;Mode=like">#0</a>, again, I think it would've unfolded differently. But at the moment you did ask your question, I think we were a bit too invested in our respective and conflicting expectations to have that discussion efficiently.<br/><br/>(For the record, in case people are wondering, the issue resolved itself quite amicably when Cedric and another player parted ways with the group, as we realized that our expectations couldn't be made to fit, at least not in the context of that particular campaign.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336982/#Comment_336982" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T10:38:59+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 10:38AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2011 10:40AM by Cedric P.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But still at the time there was a lot of stuff I found super interesting in Unknown Armies and I wondered how the game could be GMed and played, but I din't felt that this kind of discussion was very welcome. Yes the discussion emerged from actual play from the campaign, but it was more about being enthusiast about how UA could be GMed and played (so GM &amp; player craft). Later I also tried to talk about flags in general without reference to UA and this is were I received the "this is just common sense" answers. But I agree that today the discussion would probably be more fruitful and interesting if we had it again on Roludo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336984/#Comment_336984" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T10:45:05+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 10:45AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Cedric">@Cedric</a> P: The only thing I can talk about reliably on this whole thing is myself, and I remember that there had been a lot of "arguing" (it's not the right word but it's the first one that comes to mind) around the table after each session we've played.

This whole 'reclaiming' angle seems kind of orthogonal to the general premise that it would be good to talk about these things in a way that focuses on the techniques, not the identity politics involved. Trying to define (or redefine) the meaning of 'trad' or 'story' gaming seems like a massively time-consuming red herring, if the goal is just to talk about GMing more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336986/#Comment_336986" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T10:52:21+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 10:52AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jocelyn,<br/><br/>Is this thread a call to action to start rolling these techniques out in other fora?<br/><br/>If it is, how do you propose this happen? And what's the upside to those of us who are, frankly, sick to death of what feels like the inevitable gag reflex that (I, personally, believe) will result? <br/><br/>If it is not, then what are you looking for out of this? Totally not a confrontational question! Just wondering where to go.<br/><br/>As an aside and for the record, I still find it silly/offensive/ignorant -- depending in the day! -- that the various techniques that I called out in my list are labeled, by both traddies and indie folks, as "indie/storygame techniques." Like none of us were doing *any* of this before The Forge saved us from ourselves and revealed a bright shining path. I mean, I designed straight-up relationship maps that were *published* in *main stream gaming materials* when I was a freelancer. Scene-framing goes back to late-80s college era Rolemaster. "Flags" and "anti-flags" fell largely into "don't be a self-absorbed douche" territory for me starting in early '90s WOD games, i.e. just being sensitive to how the player viewed her character. LiR is the only "oh duh, yeah!" thing I can say I've pulled as a totally new trick I'd never really thought about before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_336987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336987/#Comment_336987" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T10:53:38+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 10:53AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I remember many of those types discussions about how to do things like empower players that came up, at least at RPG.net.  Thing is to me it didnt seem like the forge theory was used as the club you make it out to be.  It makes perfect sense in my mind for someone who had read forge theory and played games that used techniques that aided with player empowerment to try and put those forward as solutions to the problem.  What usually ended up happening is that player empowerment wasnt what the poster was actually looking for, they were looking for better techniques to make the player feel empowered without actually being empowered (i.e. illusionism or maybe participationism if you see a distinction between the two).  There was still a large school of thought that the GM was supposed to build a plot and the players were supposed to bend to fit it rather than the other way around, anything that questioned that belief was rejected.    I think there was a lot of resistance to change and when we get down to talking about a lot of these things we were coming at it with different goals in mind.  Plus there is the problem of the very fine distinction between creating a plot and running the players through it and having an interesting situation and being open to where it leads.  This can all be quite inflammatory discussion and can seem accusatory (especially with labels like illusionism) even when it's not.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I see where you are coming from and I think over time the discussion has evolved somewhat.  Many people tried to have discussions without having them end in flames or the points get lost in the noise and totally non-productive side topics.  I think some of that knowledge did get out and has been adapted and used by others.  I know many "forge" people were using a lot of the ideas in trad games and at various points talked about doing so.   Has this silenced others from bringing up their own ways of doing things?   I dont know, I dont see why it should but it's possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_336994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/336994/#Comment_336994" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T11:26:15+00:00" title="August  3, 2011 11:26AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so this whole thread has been striking home for me. Although oddly, I find myself in agreement with the folks saying there should be more discussion of techniques in relation to 'trad' games and, and I also totally agree with the 'story game' folks about a ton of these things...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the biggest parts of this for me is what I ultimately decided was my skepticism of 'trad' and 'story' games being totally different things that have no relation to each other at all. Apocalypse World is a 'trad' game in soooo many ways. It's got traditional GM and player authority for the most part, it's got mechanics that have a strong aspect of human judgement, it places it's focus on being in the skin of your character rather than a specific dramatic structure, it's very, very trad. EXCEPT it's also cut out a lot of stuff that personally impeded me in a lot of more trad games (and impedes me in Pathfinder). Stuff like how it handles equipment, and the thoughtful design of character abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompare this too, to Greg Stolze's games. They almost always avoid a lot of the stuff you'd find in say, D&amp;D; 3e long equipment lists and poorly balanced magic system, you can get a Stolze design up and running a lot faster, IMO, than you can with most White Wolf games.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the big clincher for me is Classic Traveller. Sure, there's lots of little things about it that I'd probably ignore, like the detailed mathematical formulas for gravity, but at the same time, it's advice for adventure creation is *very* good, it takes pains to set out 'procedures of play' a lot, and the skills were one of the most interesting things for me. Skills, you see, looked a hell of a lot like moves in Apocalypse World. Each skill gave the player access to a little mechanical tidbit they could use to influence the game world and fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe OSR folks may dismmiss 'modern game design' a lot of the time, but they've gone and went back, and emphasized the bits of the game that helped them the most, and have made up formalized procedures to help them run better, and they hate all this indie stuff, from what I've observed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the problem you mentioned, Jocelyn, is again a very real thing, I think. A while back, I asked for some tips and advice on how to run Pathfinder, D&amp;D; 3e here, and I didn't get much of what I was looking for. Part of that was my fault for not asking better, but I still was sort of surprised as to how little advice I got, besides the fact that magic is way too powerful (which is true), there was very little on how to emphasize the parts that work the best.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm getting at, is the problem seems to be on of communications. Story Gamers (myself included!) love things to be codified, so we codify it. The thing is, a lot of that codified stuff could be applied to 'trad' games quite easily, and you wouldn't even need to drastically change the rules or anything. We're getting at similar issues, but talking about them in different languages. 'Rules' vs 'not rules' seems a semantic distinction me, so I put it in terms of rules as I personally process better that way, others don't. And I think this, above everything else, is the big distinction here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the GM mentor thing has set off a totally different set of thoughts I'm still stewing over, but my feelings on that are still murkier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337009/#Comment_337009" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T13:21:22+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  1:21PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jocelyn,<br><br>As far as I can tell, there is GM-craft discussion happening right now in this forum.<br><br><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14798&amp;page=1#Item_16" rel="nofollow">Spotlight Hogging</a> (How to manage your table)<br><br><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14762&amp;page=1#Item_19" rel="nofollow">Object Based Magic</a> (A system-agnostic discussion of making magic more interesting in your game)<br><br><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14790&amp;page=1#Item_14" rel="nofollow">Fantasy World Bits</a> (A system-agnostic world-building brainstorming session)<br><br><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14815&amp;page=1#Item_6" rel="nofollow">Find Cool Maps</a> (Finding resources)<br><br><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14773&amp;page=1#Item_26" rel="nofollow">Explain Bangs</a> (Creating situations that are meaningful to your players and demand response)<br><br>Not all of these are exactly what you're talking about, but, in general, they're about gathering tools and materials and concepts/techniques that a GM can use to make a better game, irrespective of a specific game/system.<br><br>So I'm not sure that your assertion that these things stopped happening is correct. Some of the discussions are different. Some of the responses are "This specific game does that well". Which is true. But, as has been said in this thread, that can still be of use to trad gamers because you can learn from what a recent game does well and take that concept back to your trad style GMing.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm running a game using a semi-trad combat/task system - a modified Savage Worlds hack. And I'm planning to run my players through some old skool D&amp;D modules, with tweaks to fit the differences for the game world I'm using.<br/><br/>But I've just been reading through Apocalypse World and I really like how Fronts work. They make a lot of sense to me as a way of thinking about threats to the PCs. So I'm going to use that model to write down my thoughts about how the threats in my game are structured.<br/><br/>So I'm taking a technique. That technique was developed within a specific, recent game text. But I'm going to use it outside that context. I'm going to put it in my GM-craft toolbox and make use of it.<br/><br/>And I think that's a lot of what is happening in recent discussions. People have made games that do certain things extremely well. So when a GM wants to know about how to do that thing, it makes sense to point them at that specific game and say "Check that out, you can learn from it. And it might be the system you want to use to run your game. But even if it isn't, you might be able to adapt a few things from there that you can incorporate into your game."<br/><br/>So, yeah, pointing people at things like that has replaced SOME of the best practices discussions.<br/><br/>But others are still happening. Right here. Right now.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337013/#Comment_337013" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T13:45:06+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  1:45PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>Ah, but see, here's the thing. Those techniques and notions? They were being discussed prior to the "indie" boom. The fact that in everyone's minds - trad and story gamers alike - they have become<i>your</i>techniques is all messed up.</blockquote>\nWith this I agree 100%.<br/><br/>The problem is that there were a few specific key innovations in the "indie" scene that when they got scaled up and generalized they kind of "ate" the much older long standing techniques.<br/><br/>The notion that Relationship Maps in the broadest general sense is an "indie" thing is absurd.  Faction Maps and Plot Maps have been around forever.  I think Ron once credited GURPS Goblins as being the first published text with such and idea.  The specific new idea presented in Sorcerer's Soul had to do with *restricting* such maps to connections of JUST sex and family.  Doing that has some unique properties other kinds of maps don't.<br/><br/>Similarly the innovative idea behind Kickers in Sorcerer and Beliefs in Burning Wheel was that the GM's prep work was to be based entirely on heightening and resolving the content of those things rather than simply using a way of enticing the player into following a pathway that ultimately lead to the resolving of the solely GM created material the way Melodramatic Hooks work in Feng Shui.  But those things got bundled up into "Flags" regardless of usage.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_337014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337014/#Comment_337014" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-03T13:48:01+00:00" title="August  3, 2011  1:48PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2011 1:51PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Is discussing a character's capabilities and discerning which of them are flags or anti-flags useful for making trad games more fun, or does that make the process too story-game-like?<br/><br/>Is doodling up a relationship map of the PCs, NPCs and various organizations/factions/nations useful for trad gaming, or does the taint of story-game cling to the technique?<br/><br/>If you drift Pathfinder so that every given roll's result sticks until the situation changes, are you now playing Burning Wheel?<br/><br/>If a WoD GM spends some time before a scene starts up to clarify what each character wants out of it, is it now a story game?<br/><br/>Is ensuring that there's something personally at stake for the PCs in your big tactical battle just indie-Forgey faggotry? &lt;-- Absolutely true story from my FLGS, in reaction to a dungeon master whining to the shop owner that he doesn't know how to make his fights "interesting" any more.

To my knowledge they existed in the cultural field of rpgs in the US then too.<br/><br/>I have sticked to the classical gaming ever since, and developed it further, with the help from good GM-friends and a great audience of eager players. Other designers here in Norway has given their contributions too, to the developments of classical game design. A lot has happened since the nineties, but there are still new developments to be had. The dynamics of play and design of classical games still astounds me, and make me hope for even greater game-sessions in the future.<br/><br/>In contrast to this, I see the popular understanding of classical role-playing games, and what they are capable of, on this forum and other, to be rigid, shallow and antiquated. That is especially true when it comes to the use of a GM, as an agent for the game in relation to the players and characters.<br/><br/>Still; some US-designers of great repute do explore the field of classical games further, with games like Mouse Guard, Burning Wheel, etc. That is definitively one more reason to listen when GMs with decades of experience in both play and discussions raise their voices here. Lets all embrace a reawakening and sharing of their knowledge!<br/><br/>When such a guy talks about <i>the general principles of GM-craft</i>, please hold your tongue and take heed; it means that <i>GM-craft</i> is a reality, and indeed a sound basis for discussion. ;-)<br/><br/><i>Caveat: I am a designer of modern, GM-free, games too.

I've seen plenty of discussion about D&amp;D; and  Warhammer when they came out.  If you look at the definition for story game (I saw it somewhere around here) it makes no mention of indie games, a story game is any rpg that is about telling a story and not just beating the monsters and taking their loot (and I dont think the story gaming police will shut you down if you start talking about a game like that).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it relates to other fora.  Might I suggest another possibility,  that those best practices discussions have died down there because there isnt as much interest?  That people there have generally found what they like and are less interested in those types of discussion, that the topics of discussion are matching the interest of the majority of the posters?  That those who are interested in the best practices you are talking about have moved to places like this where those types of discussions continue?

However: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>I'm curious what this would bring to a conversation about improving GM techniques? This whole 'reclaiming' angle seems kind of orthogonal to the general premise that it would be good to talk about these things in a way that focuses on the techniques, not the identity politics involved. Trying to define (or redefine) the meaning of 'trad' or 'story' gaming seems like a massively time-consuming red herring, if the goal is just to talk about GMing more.</blockquote>\nI agree with this 100%. Why not just ask to talk about GM craft? GM tools? GM skills?<br/><br/>What is gained by framing it as a "trad" vs "indie" issue? That's a distinction none of us will ever agree on (even if we all have our own personal line of "I know it when I see it").<br/><br/>EDIT: I think that's the only reason some people are asking you what your agenda is. And, really, it's not too surprising. You DID frame this as a trad vs. indie issue. Doesn't make it *nice*... but you shouldn't be surprised by the reaction. Anyway, moving on:<br/><br/><br/>I see lots of discussion of "GM craft" on this forum (there are a few nice examples linked above in this thread). And I've never seen someone ask for GMing advice and be shot down, either. <br/><br/>My own experience with this has been interesting. I've always enjoyed discussing how we can make our games better, and I love the idea of a well-run "trad" game. (By the way, I think that's a HUGE part of why Apocalypse World is arguably the most talked-about game in this community: it has a strong "trad-ness" coupled with solid design and good GM craft techniques and ideas--most of which are not mechanics, incidentally.)<br/><br/>However, whenever I try to breach the subject with "trad gamers"... there is very little interest. It seems there is some correlation between people who are familiar with and willing to discuss indie games, and people who are interested in talking about how to improve their gaming. Not 100%, but definitely at some level. In my experience, of course: I don't even know all that many gamers, so I could be totally wrong.<br/><br/>I suspect this is right on the money, at least for many of the cases I've seen:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>It makes perfect sense in my mind for someone who had read forge theory and played games that used techniques that aided with player empowerment to try and put those forward as solutions to the problem.  What usually ended up happening is that player empowerment wasnt what the poster was actually looking for, they were looking for better techniques to make the player feel empowered without actually being empowered (i.e. illusionism or maybe participationism if you see a distinction between the two).</blockquote>\nI've posted my ideas for better games (for instance, a little essay on how to end long-running campaigns in a fulfilling and exciting way, or my thoughts on how to take player input and/or Flags to make interesting NPCs) in forums made up of mostly "trad gamers", and discussed them in person. And always, always, the response is either silence or some variation on, "We don't do that kind of thing here." There are very few who engage in discussion. No matter how carefully I avoid Forge jargon or otherwise censor myself. That's why I end up at this forum: people talk back, offer their own ideas, no matter how I frame the discussion.<br/><br/>My own experience growing up with gamers was that there was a huge cult of "GM Mystery". It was so, so important for the Mighty GM to maintain an air of mystery. You must smile knowingly, look mysteriously at the players, and roll dice behind your screen while looking through your notes. The GM must tell the players that "You can do anything!" and then subsequently make sure that the game ends up in scene 25 with the Duke impaled on a candlestick at precisely twenty minutes past eight. Or else you're a bad GM. In either case, no matter what happens, you must never admit that you fudged a rule or made something up on the spot, or took a player's suggestion. Always maintain the illusion that you're all-knowing, in control, and that everything is proceeding according to plan. Or you'll completely spoil the game for the players! That's the worst! Better keep that GM screen up on the table... even if you don't have anything to hide behind it.<br/><br/>Several times even recently I've played in some fun games where I approached the GM afterwards and said, "Hey! That was really cool. Tell me: did you know all along that the Duke could have been behind those murders, or did you just decide to go along with that when Julie came up with the idea during the court scene?" (Notice: that's just me starting a conversation about GMing, right?) Every time, the answer is a mysterious, smug glance and a strongly worded: "Wouldn't you like to know!" Sometimes with an evil cackle thrown in. ("You'll never know now, will you?" is a popular variation.)<br/><br/>People can't reconcile the popular belief that "railroading is bad!" with the traditional structure and tools of GMing, such as the expectations that a GM will start and end a satisfying story in a set period of time. How can you do that without severely curtailing player input and freedom? You can't. So discussing this kind of thing with people who've internalized both beliefs--first, that players must have freedom, and second, that GMs are responsible for the outcome of the game--is almost impossible. No wonder people get angry! They don't have a good answer to this dilemma, but they're not ready to discard these beliefs. You give them "story techniques" and they laugh at you: "My players would destroy my carefully-crafted campaign!" So you start talking about techniques for "Illusionism" (even if you don't use that word: let's say you lay out a nice way to focus a one-shot scenario, as Jocelyn did in the other thread), and they get all offended ("MY players are free to do whatever they want! I would never railroad them!"). It's a tough line to toe.<br/><br/>Now, that's my (very limited) experience. I make no claims that this is true of all gamers: but I've seen a lot of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337150/#Comment_337150" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T13:09:14+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  1:09PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by Paul T.</cite>What is gained by framing it as a "trad" vs "indie" issue?</blockquote>\nThat's a pretty good question, actually, and you're right that answering it will probably clarify where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>First off, I'm not framing it as trad versus indie in the antagonistic sense. I'm framing it as versus in the comparative sense, since to me these are two different things.<br/><br/>During the boom, I was (and still am) quite satisfied overall with my traditional gaming experience. In the midst of all the enthusiasm, a lot of people were presenting "indie" / story games not as something new or as something different, but as something better. Trad games didn't feel at all broken to me (they still don't) and "if it ain't broken, don't fix it." So I largely ignored mentions of "indie" / story games because I felt I was not their target audience, since my own trad experience was not broken.<br/><br/>I started playing around with story games when the boom died down a bit and when I came across people who presented them to me as something new and/or something different.<i>That</i> I was interested in. And to me, they definitely felt different (and still do.)<br/><br/>Based on my own experience of both types, I feel that trad RPGs and story games are two different things. When I play 'em, they <i>feel</i> different, in the same way that playing a trad RPG (or a story game) feels different from playing a boardgame. Even when I play a story game that fits my tastes and I'm all like "fuck yes, this is awesome", that play experience does not scratch my traditional RPG itch. At all.<br/><br/>Now, this might not be how everyone experiences both subset of games, but I've talked with a lot of gamers who feel the same.<br/><br/>So this is why, for me, it's useful to distinguish between trad RPGs and story games. Because when I'm looking for advice on how to better my traditional RPG experience, if someone makes suggestions that turn that trad RPG into a story game, I'm not interested. If I wanted to play a story game, I would. Asking advice specifically for my trad experience means that's the itch I'm trying to scratch, and being told "I know your back itches, but you really should scratch your scalp" is not useful at all.<br/><br/>(For the record, the opposite is also true.

The game Werewolf: The Forsaken has a book called Territories. This book creates a mechanical framework for players to have an explicit hand in the setting. Does that mean if you play with this supplement, it's a story game, and if you didn't, it's a trad game?<br/>\n<br/>\nI bring this up because, assuming we can define 'trad games', 'Story Games' now make up everything that doesn't fit into that category now, and that's problematic to me, because one of those categories says Apocalypse World, Mouse Guard, Do: Pilgrims of the Flying temple can use related advice, and Unknown Armies, Vampire, and Call of Cthulhu all related as well. And that distinction seems very artificial to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my feeling is, there *isn't* that much of a huge distinction between them, at least not one I'm comfortable making. And I think this actually illustrates the problem in the relationship between 'Trad' and 'Story' gamers some of the time is that they think they're very different things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337164/#Comment_337164" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T13:50:12+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  1:50PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jocelyn, how do you feel about minimally-meta flagging?

They get rewards (both temporary and permanent) for playing towards those things.<br><br>The important point here is that the GM is encouraged by principle but not by any specific rules to prep an adventure around those flags.  So the players still have no hand in creating the game's content, and don't have to think out-of-character during play (and the SAs are generally from the character's point of view as well, with the arguable exception of Destiny).<br/><br/>But like, you know, technically the GM could railroad you into some sort of crazy adventure where you're far from home and none or almost none of your SAs are ever going to come up.  There are no hard and fast numerical or scene-framing rules to prevent that.

I was worried you'd be offended by my post!<br/><br/>Here's my answer (which seems to be what Matt was thinking of, as well):<br/><br/>I don't think the "trad" vs. "indie" distinction is as helpful as you think. Mostly because everyone's definition is different.<br/><br/>*You* have a sense of what scratches your back, and what doesn't. You need to experiment and try a lot of different games and find which techniques work for you and which don't. I suspect it's a highly, highly personal thing. For instance, I designed a very, very "story" game (no character stats, no task resolution, scene economy, structured endgame) and was surprised to find while playing it that it totally scratched my "trad game" itch. I would never have expected that! But there is some combination of elements in there that make it work for me, make it feel like a "trad game" in a way that D&amp;D and GURPS and whatever other games I played (in retrospect) did not.<br/><br/>Kickers (from Sorcerer) are an interesting example: you can't get more player-side agency than inventing your own character AND the circumstances of what's happening to them. You can literally say, "My character wakes up from a narcotic stupor to find himself staring down at the "Launch" button for the nuclear apocalypse," right?<br/><br/>However, because Kickers are *written down* rather than spoken out loud at the table in play, for most people I've spoken to there is the sense that describing the Kicker is not part of "play", and therefore can still work in a completely "trad" game without making it feel like a "story game". After all, in terms of *what you do at the table*, it's not too different from writing up a character history, which has been part of "traditional play" in many circles for a long, long time.<br/><br/>I think all these techniques affect all of us in different ways, and you may be surprised by what combination of techniques really does "scratch your back".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337170/#Comment_337170" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T14:14:46+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  2:14PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a> T.: Also, the stuff you've described in your reply to Vernon?

In that environment, discussion is practically impossible.<br/><br/>Having some opposing beliefs (like player agency and the restrictions against railroading) makes it even harder.<br/><br/>While I agree that many "nerds" are rude, in the situations I'm thinking of rudeness was not a factor. Rather, it was culturally accepted by those people that if you were "a GM" (a significant title that separates you from the common folk), the burden of your position is yours to bear alone. (Athough sometimes people who were all "GMs" and were not playing in any games together would share their dark secrets with each other away from their players.) It was my question that was rude (like asking a magician how their trick is done), not the response.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337185/#Comment_337185" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T15:52:31+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  3:52PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2011 3:54PM by Wordman.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>You're kidding, right?<a id="Item_45" name="Item_45"></a></blockquote>\nNo.<br/><br/>But the conversation has moved on, so don't worry about it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>My own experience growing up with gamers was that there was a huge cult of "GM Mystery". It was so, so important for the Mighty GM to maintain an air of mystery. You must smile knowingly, look mysteriously at the players, and roll dice behind your screen...</blockquote>\nI think, going back to the start of this thread, Jocelyn's point was like this (paraphrasing):<br/><br/>At a point in time, this GM Mystery Cult existed. A bit before the Forge, some significant discussion took place about moving on from that cult (though it wasn't phrased as such at the time). Then the Forge came and sort of "drowned out" that disussion, replacing it with Forge-speak. Now that the roar of the Forge has subsided and people have learned a bunch of stuff, the GM Mystery cult still remains. It would be interesting to discuss moving on from that cult again, knowing what we know now.<br/><br/>Assume for a second that this is a fair paraphrase.<br/><br/>Given this premise, then during the "Forge heyday" or whatever you want to call it, one of the following happened:<br/><br/>1) <i>Every single person</i> who was at all motivated to move on from the GM Mystery Cult <i>did so</i>. Either they embraced the Forge or otherwise evolved their game to the point the GM Mystery Cult is no longer a factor in their games. Everyone else was not (and still is not) motivated to move away from the GM Mystery Cult, so discussion with them about it would be pointless. (This, I think, is what Shreyas is saying.)<br/><br/>2) Some people who <i>might</i> have been motivated to move on from the GM Mystery Cult didn't even notice that the Forge happened, so remain in the Cult today. Such people might be receptive to a new discussion about moving on from the Cult. If this is true, however, such people are almost guaranteed not be reading Story Games (the forum) or story games (in general). (This is a point made a bit at the beginning of the thread, I think.)<br/><br/>3) There are people who know about (and even like) "modern" game design, but still embrace the GM Mystery Cult anyway. Some such people, should they exist, might welcome a discussion about how to fold techniques from story games into the Cult, honing their old craft with newer tools. I think the original post, though it wouldn't have stated it like this, is hoping this is true.<br/><br/>And, actually, I think it might be. I think this for the same reason that I disagree with one of the initial assumptions of the original post in this thread: it seems to me that that discussions about GM "craft" did not disappear the way the original post says they did. Gnome Stew, for example, often has "how to be a better GM" posts. Numerous podcasts do as well. I don't know where that leaves us.<br/><br/>Maybe Jocelyn can give an example of what it is expected to look like when "story games aficionados ponder about how to port the best of their subset of gaming to traditional RPGs, without denaturing them or outright turning them into story games".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337204/#Comment_337204" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T19:30:59+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  7:30PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>But the main thing I was trying to point out is that the RPG culture <b>I was familiar with</b> until I met people like the gamers on this forum actively prevents people from having these discussions.

And yet you seem to always conflate your own pre-storygame experience with trad gaming.  It sounds to me like it was simply bad gaming and though it fell under the trad structure, there are many communities of traditional play where these kinds of discussions are active and encouraged.  In my current group we will discuss GM technique, players' (all of them) goals and how the campaign is actually jibing with them and many other structural and analytical elements before during and after any given campaign.  We won't always have those discussions and some players participate more than others, but it is a fundamental and integral part of our gaming procedure.  This has the way it has been for me since the beginning really.  Even in grade 7, while it was primitive, this kind of discussion was present.<br/><br/>Your experience does not exemplify trad gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337205/#Comment_337205" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T19:36:26+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  7:36PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suspect many of you suffered from some bad GMs in your day, because this constant reference to a "GM mystery cult" as an actual significant and widespread phenomenon has no basis in reality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337206/#Comment_337206" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T19:39:18+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  7:39PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite><i>For me</i>, here are the essential characteristics of a traditional roleplaying game:</blockquote>\nI'd add to this list "Combat dominates both the written rules and gameplay."<br/><br/>I have to repeat Jocelyn's "seriously?" in response to this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337211/#Comment_337211" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T20:20:49+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  8:20PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2011 8:25PM by Paul_T.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            walkerp/Olman,<br/><br/>You are quite correct. I am simply reporting my own experiences: I do not claim that they are representative of anything. In fact, I've been exposed to far less variety of gamer than (very likely) most of the other people in this discussion. Still, I've seen a LOT of what I'm describing. I've been tempted to assume sometimes that it was an age thing: that I'm just smarter about certain things because I'm older, as are the people I'm playing with. And there's certainly some truth to that.<br/><br/>But I still see this a lot. I've recently moved to a different city and become involved with a gaming community there: a city-wide, very mature, well-run group of gamers numbering in the hundreds. They even have a strong contingent of people "pushing" indie games. However (since this thread is about the discussion of GM craft), when I joined the community I tried to start a number of discussions by sharing techniques, ideas, etc, on their forum: things I thought were innovative and interesting ways to improve gaming. No one on the forums commented. No one I've met in person seemed interested; no one mentioned it. Meanwhile a thread like, "What's the best feat to combine with Improved Initiative?" receives a hundred replies. <br/><br/>So, why are these "trad gamers" not interested in discussing GM craft? I don't know. But I've seen that in other communities, too.<br/><br/>Similarly, when I met some of them, the very first question was, "Oh, so are you a player or a <i>GM</i>?" With big wide eyes, and the suggestion that they would be very impressed to hear the latter in response.<br/><br/>I participated in a game once where the GM informed me before playing that she wasn't very familiar with the rules. Could I help her with that in play? Sure, I said! However, when I actually tried to do so at the session, all the players looked at me like I had just committed murder. "What are you doing? That's the GM, it doesn't matter if the rules aren't right." "Indie games are all about the story--the rules don't matter!"<br/><br/>I quickly learned not to do that any more.<br/><br/>Another example:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite><cite>Posted by Wordman</cite>I'd add to this list "Combat dominates both the written rules and gameplay."</blockquote>\nOne of the most intelligent gamers I used to play with (he now runs a gaming company and works as the editor for a game magazine), well past adolescence (and significantly older than me) was adamant on this point:<br/><br/>"If it doesn't have combat, it's not an RPG. Period."<br/><br/>Now, let me state again that I am not making any kind of claims about the RPG world at large. I'm just reporting my own experiences. Are they representative of gamers at large? You tell me! I don't know.<br/><br/>One thing I <i>can</i> say: this thread (and this kind of discussion) always really makes me want to play a "trad" game without any of these social problems. It sounds like a lot of fun! So far, every time I've tried... it was not as fun as advertised. But I keep wanting to try! It sounds like a blast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337213/#Comment_337213" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T20:25:03+00:00" title="August  4, 2011  8:25PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>One of the most intelligent gamers I used to play with (he now runs a gaming company and works as the editor for a game magazine), well past adolescence (and significantly older than me) was adamant on this point:</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>"If it doesn't have combat, it's not an RPG.

It's got nothing to do with how mysteeeeeeerious the art of GMing is, it's just supply and demand: lots of people want the fun of being a player, only a few want the fun of being a GM.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Do "story games" and such attract more people who run games, whereas "trad" forums attract more players?</blockquote>\nPossibly.  That has an air of truthiness to it, anyway.  (which maybe means I shouldn't be so quick to believe it, but what the hell, I'll believe it anyway.)<br/><br/>One thing that a lot of indie games do is split up the responsibilities and roles of the game differently, putting some GM-fun in with player-fun and vice versa, and if what you want out of your gaming is player-fun, this is a serious bummer.  If what you actually want to do is affect the game world through the actions of a single character, games that tell you to step out of that and use broader narrative powers are just not going to click with you.  If you love discovering things and investigating mysteries, games that tell <i>you</i> to make up what's on the other side of the mountain or what's inside the dirty cop's locked file cabinet are basically breaking your fun.<br/><br/>It's probably why total newbs have an easier time with "anti-traditional" games than experienced gamers do: they have no frame of reference for any of the things the game will ask them to do, and no expectations about what kind of fun they will be able to have with it.  Go to someone who's been gaming for years and tell them "come play this with us," and they'll think, "Awesome!  I get to play!"...meaning that they will get to have the kind of fun they expect to have as a player in a RPG, and then they get whiplash when the game asks them to do a few GM-type things as well.  I find that it helps to be waaaaaaay more specific about what the game actually is and explain how it is played <i>before</i> asking, just to manage their expectations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337231/#Comment_337231" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-04T22:53:22+00:00" title="August  4, 2011 10:53PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><strong>Experiment</strong></p>\n<p>Try starting a forum, call it "The GM Only Forum' or what have you, and start talking about GMcraft, as system-agnostically or specifically as you like, and see what happens.

Those where my 'trad' or 'mainstream' or 'non-forge' or 'Big Other' (for you Lacanians) years wherein at first I was a devotee and then as a priest. As anarchic or protestant as it sounds, currently I want everyone to get in on the Sacrament of the Game Master. Which is to say, I really, really, enjoy playing with other GMs or complete novices.

I'm right there with him.<br><br>Third, to address Jocelyn's original point, I see a lot this kind of thing, especially considering the number of blog and web-zines dedicated to GMcraft with a 'trad' focus. Check-out r/rpg sometime.<br><br>Forth, in regards to both 'trad', AW and GMcraft, there was a thread on r/rpg where someone was asking about first session and campaign advice. The system wasn't mentioned but somehow I gleaned that it was for either a DnD game or some fantasy lookalike. I replied with my half-remembered paraphrasing of AW's MC section, the important stuff, like, play to find out what happens. This spawned a lot of positive elaboration from the community. The irony here is that Vincent wrote AW and the MC chapter. Vincent is second only to (maybe) Ron when it comes to Forge-theory and Forge-design. Moreover, 'trad' groups have had a lot of success and fun with AW. As a 'GM', Vincent and John Harper's (mostly theory and system agnostic) craft discussion (and games) have really, really helped me run 'Indie' and 'Trad' games, with 'mixed groups.' <br/><br/>I don't think anything has been lost or threatened.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337238/#Comment_337238" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T00:03:26+00:00" title="August  5, 2011 12:03AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Orly, you are a gentleman scholar, but I entreat you to not take my position as a farcical one despite my farcical word choice.

It is patently clear that accepting adoration and social influence because one is the holder of some secret taboo is deeply, deeply satisfying to many people. What are GMs but a priesthood? Leave them to their flock and let us not judge any to be lesser for it. It's clear that you don't operate that way any more, but that culture seems to be self-sustaining and functional for enough people.</p>\n<p>Is Mearls the Pope of D&amp;D?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_337240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337240/#Comment_337240" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T00:16:19+00:00" title="August  5, 2011 12:16AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2011 6:45AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>"If it doesn't have combat, it's not an RPG. Period."</blockquote>Oh, this brings back memories of discussions we had, back in the eighties and nineties! I met that claim again and again. LOL!<br/><br/>The world has moved on, even though someone seems to think it has not. A role-playing game may be exactly that in a multitude of ways today. And there don't necessarily have to be combat involved.<br/><br/>My definitions:<br/><br/><b>- Classical role-playing games:</b> the games master is responsible for the use of the method. Each individual member of the group (including the GM) is responsible for interaction and character-immersion.<br/><br/><b>- Modern role-playing games: </b>the players take equal responsibility for the use of the method. Each individual member of the group is responsible for interaction and character-immersion.<br/><br/><b>- Story games:</b> the players take equal responsibility for the use of the method. Each individual member of the group is responsible for interaction and narrative contributions.<br/><br/>It is simple, but functional. <br/><i>And important; it does not include factors outside the games themselves, like; how this game and that was published (the so-called "indie").</i><br/><br/>I find Jocelyns point of view here quite refreshing. His (her?) stubborn maintenance of it is impressing. A sharp intellect and a level head is always a good combination.

I take you're position seriously because you're clever enough to phrase it the way that you did. <br/><br/>I didn't mean to imply that all ritual is pointless (RPG are mostly ritual!) but that I find the uneven expectations leveled at players and GMs to be disappointing as a player (I want to contribute and shit; not just narratively but mechanically too: let's hack this thing!) and exhausting as a GM (I do everything; everyone else just shows up and watches my song and dance.) I'm happy to take on different roles in different rituals so long as everyone is pouring their hearts into the rite. But if there's no you in team or I in team, then no one's on the team. <br/><br/>But like I said, anarchist or protestant, not without ritual just a little more even handed with power and responsibility. That's even for games where I have to wear a pointy hat. <br/><br/>I agree with you that for many, many people, being a player is totally their jazz. Which is cool and all but we don't talk about 'player-burn-out' over on those trad forums; we talk about GM-burn-out. I think that in discussions of GM-craft, that topic can and should be addressed. The thing is that dirty hippie story game cracked that nut already: you delegate the work-load to altar-boys, monks, nuns and deacons. You get to the point where everyone is reading the Vulgate and some dude is tacking shit to the front door. Which I think is great but maybe not if you're the Pope or the Bishop or whatever. <br/><br/>Man, I totally misread a part of you post: it certainly possible that people get off on being the GM, but shit man, I've done a lot of perverted things in my time and that's not on the list. <br/><br/>Shreyas, you are one kinky cat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

T.</cite>After all, that's the question Jocelyn is asking: "How come since the whole Forge, etc, thing, non-indie people have stopped discussing how to be better GMs?"</blockquote>\nYeah, but in my eyes that question is based on a flawed premise. Because I don't think (non-indie) people have stopped discussing how to be a better GM.<br/><br/>Now, admittedly I wasn't there in the "golden days" Jocelyn is talking about, so maybe my comparison is off and maybe there actually was a lot more of this kind of discussion going on. But from where I stand I think the "how to be a better GM" thing is still very much alive. I think there is a fair number of discussions like these on various fora and there is an even greater number of blogs where DMs share their craft (<i>especially</i> amongst the OSR crowd, which really puts pressure on the "non-indie, trad-gamers don't talk about GMing" argument). Maybe, just maybe the "post-forge" crowd simply has a better starting platform because of a developed jargon and textual examples (flags, keys, bangs, r-maps etc.).<br/><br/>I do think however that there is a contingent of gamers who have a "Cult of the GM" thing going on, and don't seek improvement and isolate themselves in secrecy. But I'm not sure I want to start talking about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337254/#Comment_337254" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T05:02:33+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  5:02AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2011 5:06AM by Jocelyn Robitaille.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Captain Thark</cite>I bring this up because, assuming we can define 'trad games', 'Story Games' now make up everything that doesn't fit into that category now, and that's problematic to me</blockquote>\nIMHO, if we were to try and come up with definition of trad and story games, we should come up with the definitions and then use specific games to test these definitions and fine tune them.

Clearly, you and others do not buy that definition <i>at all</i>, while, to me, any definition of "traditional" that didn't include combat-centrism, while possibly still useful, wouldn't really be describing the thing that I have in my mind as "traditional" (which is ingrained in my brain as games where the vast majority of the time at the table during actual play is concerned with details of combat: <i>D&amp;D</i>, <i>Shadowrun</i>, <i>Exalted</i>, <i>Twilight 2000</i>, <i>Gamma World</i>, <i>Traveller</i>, etc.).<br/><br/>As an example, <i>Apocalypse World</i> largely meets your definition of "traditional", yet I would not call it a "trad game", ever. Others might.<br/><br/>My point here isn't to argue the specifics about which definition is right or wrong. The point is that just the evidence in this thread alone suggests that some sort of universally-agreed upon definition of "traditional game" is a very tall order. And, that makes the exercise somewhat counter-productive.<br/><br/>Now, on the flip side, I'm a big fan of labels and tight definitions. A slightly different tactic might be to invent new terms for the purposes you want, without pulling in baggage that forms an obstacle to the goal of the discussion. For example, if you declared that games that exactly meet your definition are called "Betty games" and that games that meet that same definition <i>plus combat-centrism</i> are called "Veronica games", it's conceivable that having labels to those tight definitions might lead somewhere. Or not. Hard to tell, but might be worth trying.<br/><br/>Also, let me say that I, too, would <i>love</i> to see the results of Shreyas' experiment. I don't know that I love it enough to set it up myself, but it is tempting. I think such a thing would need to start with the mentality (forced or otherwise) of "assume that being a part of the 'GM preisthood' is <i>awesome</i>", and seeing where it leads you. I don't think I could pretend to hold the belief very long, but I am <i>sure</i> there are people out there that do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337267/#Comment_337267" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T08:25:30+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  8:25AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not a horrible definition, although the "bulk of the rules and play time is dedicated to combat" meme is an old Forge/Ron (?) favorite.

There is a very specific way that trad games look and feel and talk; extinction of the authorial voice is one of the core aspects of that look-and-feel. Playbooks are pretty dirty-hippie; so is the very idea of Hx and the idea that players get to make decisions about when other characters than their own get XP. I suspect I could go on, but why bother? The point is that AW takes some elements from trad games (classes, uh monsters, the man behind the curtain) but it's got hippie bones and hippie clothes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337270/#Comment_337270" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T08:49:56+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  8:49AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jocelyn,<br/><br/>My point is that the definition you've posted is a subjective and personal one.

(Let's assume you have, very thoroughly!)<br/><br/>So any discussion based around "not violating" those guidelines is only useful to you and your game. Your "trad gamer" neighbours might have a totally different set of lines they don't want crossed.<br/><br/>For example: your last bullet-point is very vague. What does it mean to "have power over the narrative through the characters only?" What are those "very few exceptions"?<br/><br/>In some games, you're expected to write up a character background and history. You might be allowed to say, "I was brought up by the Order of the Black Hand." And then the GM will ask, "OK, who are they? What are they like? Where do they live?"<br/><br/>Or if you have, say, an animal companion, you get to choose what animal it is and what they're like... maybe even decide how they act in the game.<br/><br/>In another game (and I've seen this), you're not even allowed to decide what kind of family your character came from, or must ask the GM for any details about your character's past. And you certainly wouldn't be allowed to invent an entire society or Order in a character history.<br/><br/>Those two games are very different.<br/><br/>And what about something like this:<br/><br/>"OK, the sun rises on the castle. Everyone's getting ready for the wedding. Jocelyn, where is your character and what is he doing that morning?"<br/><br/>In some groups, you are free to answer in great detail: "Oh, he's waking up in the bed of his lover, one of the milk-maids, while her husband is away. She's reading to him from a book of ancient fairy tales."<br/><br/>In other groups... people would gasp in surprise at such a question: "You're playing this game wrong!"<br/><br/>Very different gaming advice and "GM craft" would apply to these different games, though all would be "trad" by most definitions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theg33k" title="theg33k"><img alt="theg33k" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7043/fil31771.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theg33k">theg33k</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337271/#Comment_337271" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T08:55:37+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  8:55AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As kind of an amusing side note on the matter of combat/trad games, I was running <a href="http://critical-hits.com/ch-presents/refuge-in-audacity/" rel="nofollow">Refuge in Audacity</a> for my gaming group the other night, and while we all really enjoyed ourselves, I couldn't help thinking what a trad game it was. I mean, the game was intentionally built to be 90%+ combat, but the repetition of "initiative, roll to see it you hit, roll defense, roll damage" ad infinitum, with most of that responsibility being shouldered squarely by the GM was maddening after a year or so of running modern/story games.

I gave my definition mostly as an example, and bear no illusions about the fact that it's currently representative of my tastes.<br/><br/>I still think it'd be possible to create a viable definition of what a "trad game" is. I also think it'd be possible to build that definition based on some kind of rigorous process.<br/><br/>Let's take a page from taxonomy, for instance. Here's how a workable definition could be produced.<br/><br/>(A) Agree on a definition of game taken from a dictionnary, since what exactly constitutes a game has been studied much more seriously than trad RPGs or  story games.<br/><br/>(B) Ask a random and statistically representative sample of gamers to list all the trad games they know in column A, and all the story games they know in column B. Do not allow for games to be posted in both columns.<br/><br/>(C) Make a list of all the games that have been listed solely in column A (this takes out any hybrids and points of contention.)<br/><br/>(D) Start a discussion thread on one of more forums asking people to either make a statement or bring a counter-example. The statement must always be "A traditional RPG is a GAME that [fill in the blank]", the term game must be used in a way that fits the agreed upon definition, and the statement must always state something affirmative (as it is impossible to prove statistically that something doesn't exist or is impossible). The counter-examples must come only from the list of games created at step C. (For instance: "A Traditional RPG is a game that focuses on combat" ... "Oh yeah?

So long as you don't automatically take our mention of our experience with traditional games as "judgements". Me saying that the vast majority of the table time in the trad games that I have played was spent in the minutia of combat isn't a judgement. It's an observation. (Heck, that's even an empirically measurable observation.)<br/><br/>When you hear me say something like "it totally sucked that we spent all our time in the minutia of combat", that will be a judgement. You haven't heard me say that, though, because (WARNING: JUDGMENTAL LANGUAGE COMING) I sometimes like spending all of the time in a game dealing with the minutia of combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337292/#Comment_337292" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T11:04:28+00:00" title="August  5, 2011 11:04AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Wordman">@Wordman</a>: You've stated that by definition, trad games focus on combat.

Trad games are about the GM providing a direction (having a mysterious stranger show up and offer them a bag of gold to investigate some mysterious happening/the king gives them a mission to save the kingdom etc./) and players acting to follow along with this, that storyline and discovering what the gm has planned is supposed to be what provides interest.  This is distinct from character goals, which could be included in a character background those goals would be subservient to the larger goal the gm has provided for the game and their inclusion would be his choice.   Indie games focus on getting the player to provide goals for the character and having the choices they make for the character in play lead to the interesting story events which provide interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nps. I should add there was little stopping a trad game being played in a more story game manner it was more a question of gaming culture.  I'm sure there were many who played in a far different manner than what I've suggested.  Indie games push that play to the forefront and add mechanical support for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_337326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337326/#Comment_337326" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T14:23:56+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  2:23PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2011 2:39PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>Me saying that the vast majority of the table time in the trad games that I have played was spent in the minutia of combat isn't a judgement.

Even though you can group them with your definition and not break them, I could easily see someone who loved one hating the hating the other. I can see lots of techniques that would fit one and not the other. Hell, I could see that with Runequest and AD&amp;D.;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advice for one wouldn't be good for the other, so I think that cutting up games into 'trad' and 'story' is not going to help much, if at all. Some games are pretty cloesly related (Like the Cthulhu games totally all work with similar advice, even Cthulhu Dark. Cthulhu Dark in brilliant because of this, BTW), and have interchangeable parts, but I think 'trad' games are diverse enough we should be careful about assuming their inherent similarity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337329/#Comment_337329" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T14:32:28+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  2:32PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd also like to randomly put out I'm continually saddened by the use of 'story game' to denote something other than a 'trad' game, as the original idea was to make it so 'trad' RPG and 'indie' RPG (which was the in vogue term until the last year or so, lest we forget) could fall under the same banner, and we could get on with designing and talking about games with less arguments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>That totally worked out exactly that way.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337332/#Comment_337332" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T14:35:20+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  2:35PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This denominational debate has been had many many times in the past.

However (since this thread is about the discussion of GM craft), when I joined the community I tried to start a number of discussions by sharing techniques, ideas, etc, on their forum: things I thought were innovative and interesting ways to improve gaming.

Just like the people who eat fast food are in the majority of people who eat out in North America.  They are the mainstream.  Equating mainstream gamers to trad gamers is akin to equating mainstream eaters with people who eat meat.  Just because the majority of fast food restaurants serve meat does not mean that carnivores are all mainstream eaters who only eat at fast food restaurants.<br/><br/>First, there is a large group of people who play in a traditional style who are not and do not consider themselves part of the mainstream.  They participate in many of the same discussions and experiments that go on here, though with a different philosophical approach and different (and probably less) jargon.<br/><br/>Second, the mainstream itself is changing so that elements that are not considered traditional are becoming adopted into their gameplay.  4e and its Magic and WoW based structural elements are things that many tradtional gamers found abhorrent and wanted nothing to do with. But the vast majority went right along with them.<br/><br/>The point I am trying to make is that this vast group that you have identified in your new city (and what city is it, btw?) should not be identified as being philosophically "traditional", though their gameplay assumes many elements of traditional play.

I started playing D&amp;D when it was first published, with its intended audience -- war gamers.  The whole idea of an intended outcome would have be anathema in those circles.  You set up a scenario, then the players played in it, and the outcome was determined in play.  As adapted into D&amp;D, this quickly became mission-based play, where the GM would build scenarios where some authority would recruit the player characters to go off on some mission (fetch the artifact, scout that valley, rescue the captive, clear the monsters out of the abandoned fortress, etc.).  What happened during the mission was determined using a mix of the supplied rules, house rules(*) and roleplaying.  It wouldn't have occurred to us to have a planned plot -- that would have been cheating!<br/><br/>(* House rules were usually to replace rules that were not felt to work well (like XP for gold, which was almost invariably dropped early on) or to fill in gaps in the supplied rules.  That whole OSR "rulings, not rules" thing?  Never heard of it at the time.  Rulings were necessary because the early rule sets were so incomplete.

I like your distinction of traditional vs. mainstream.

And in a way that would be useful to your challenge (to provide solid GM advice without "violating" the precepts of such traditional gaming)?<br/><br/>I guess what it comes down to for me is:<br/><br/>* You want to discuss GM advice/techniques, etc, without "violating" a certain concept of play. You want ideas and advice that makes your games better without making them too *different*.<br/>* You seem to think that this is something that we could all agree on, and perhaps also that a large number of people would rejoice at and benefit from this kind of conversation.<br/><br/>However, I honestly don't know how to do that. It feels like what you're really asking for is "advice for gaming that I like and doesn't take me outside my comfort zone". Which is a fine request, but it's a bizarre thing to lay blame for the lack of such advice at the feet of new game design, and to request that more people provide advice/techniques that particularly suit your chosen style of play.<br/><br/>I mean, I like "story games"/"indie games" (whatever those are), but I'm not going to like all the advice or all the techniques that come along from the "story games" crowd. Just like I'm sure you're not going to like all the advice you hear from the "traditional" crowd. In the end we all have to read critically, maintain an open mind, and try different things. It's no different for an "indie" fan or an OSR fan or a "traditional" fan.<br/><br/>But it sounds like I'm missing your point somehow. I'm just not sure exactly how.

Truth be told, I was there for these pre-Forge-boom best practice discussions. <i><b>I</b></i> got the chance to benefit from them. My preoccupation is that these discussions are nowhere near as frequent as before, and I think this is a loss for the community of trad gamers as a whole. So this whole train of thought is not so much about how I could come across discussions that can benefit me, but how I think it's a shame that discussions that have benefited me have now died down and fail to benefit others.<br/><br/>If I have anything to gain in this, on a personnal level, it's that any culture of bettering one's GMing in trad circles is bound to pay dividends to me at some point because I'll get to play in even better games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337374/#Comment_337374" name="Item_182" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T18:47:01+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  6:47PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Some general thoughts on duality</b><br/><br/>I noticed that every time I make distinctions between trad games and story games in the thread, people start mentioning stuff about my comfort zones, my "political" agenda, rival camps, etc. This puzzles me, for two reasons.<br/><br/>(1) Isn't it even conceivable for you guys that someone could see trad RPGs and story games as two very different things without putting them in competition with each other?

I do think the "politics" of all this stuff are really... unnecessary. It's a shame people on both sides (or ALL sides!) have been under attack so often that suspicions and defensive posturing come up with being asked.<br/><br/>I think this is one of the places where we might be disconnecting:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jocelyn Robitaille</cite>(1) Isn't it even conceivable for you guys that someone could see trad RPGs and story games as two very different things without putting them in competition with each other?</blockquote>\nFor me, it's not conceivable. Not because I can't see how to talk about them without competition, but because I can't "see [them] as two very different things". <br/><br/>While there are some games that are definitely "trad" (e.g. AD&amp;D 2nd Edition) and some games that are definitely "indie" (say, Polaris), most games to me fall somewhere in the middle. There's a wide continuum in my mind, and each game has more or less "trad-ness" or "indie-ness". There are older games with lots of weird and unusual elements, there are new games designed by Forge/indie folks that are arguably quite traditional (e.g. Apocalypse World), and lots of weird hybrids that combine super-traditional elements with super-indie elements (e.g. Old School Hack). While to me there are clear "flavours" of "traditionality" and "story game-ness" -- when I taste it, I go, "Ah, there is some of that!" -- I can't draw any kind of dividing line.<br/><br/>On top of that, the way the games are actually played AT THE TABLE is going to vary again. I've played (for example) a game of Mutants and Masterminds where I was handed a three-page character sheet, but when I asked people what things on the character sheet meant, no one knew. "We just roll a d20 sometimes, high is good. Not terribly often, though." Players often were prompted by the GM to narrate "montages". What kind of game is that? Indie? Trad? Neither? I don't know.<br/><br/>"OSR" gaming (as is being discussed by many people in this thread) doesn't seem to be either indie or trad either. <br/><br/>And what about D&amp;D4E, when played like a tabletop version of World of Warcraft?<br/><br/>Now what if we play D&amp;D4E like a MMORPG, but between sessions e-mail each other, creating twisted love triangle-type soap opera interactions between our characters? What kind of game is that?<br/><br/>I find the distinction not to be terribly useful. And very hard to engage with. <br/><br/>Jocelyn, I bet this whole conversation would be 306% more productive and fun if you shared some of these techniques or advice, instead. I'd love to hear about them! Both from a practical perspective (cool new tricks for my own gameplay) and from a historical perspective (what were people thinking about "player empowerment" pre-Forge?). I recommend you start a new thread and post some examples. I bet if we discuss a specific technique for a specific game, then we can really get somewhere.<br/><br/>(And then I realize that's what you trying to get away from, right? "Why are people always talking about specific games nowadays, instead of giving general gaming advice?" Oops. So maybe never mind!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337394/#Comment_337394" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-05T21:13:12+00:00" title="August  5, 2011  9:13PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2011 9:29PM by komradebob.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite> That whole OSR "rulings, not rules" thing?

I call that <i>dialogue techniques</i>, and it has been part of my methods for role-playing games, both classical and modern, since 1989. When lecturing on GM-craft I tell the students that they, as GMs, may be said to "play the players".<br/><br/>This ties neatly into what Aronson is saying of early gaming (I know about Braunstein, and the miniature-connection):<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite>What happened during the mission was determined using a mix of the supplied rules, house rules(*) and roleplaying.  It wouldn't have occurred to us to have a planned plot -- that would have been cheating!</blockquote>It's a kind of open-field <i>tactical simulation</i>; with emphasis on how characters behave and respond in critical situations.<br/><br/>Since then role-playing games has developed into open-field simulations of <i>nearly any human condition</i>, including how we fares in deadly combat. The emphasis on characters has become more poignant. Some great games are going deeper than ever, into psycho-social interaction of near-reality quality. Other great games are going lighthearted, playing on genre conventions, and characterizations full of bluff and comedy.<br/><br/><i>The open field</i> has been undermined in some circles, but that is not what classical role-playing games are really about. Rather; it is just an example of some people failing to get the gist of rpg. The open field, as a principle, is of great importance to rpgs. It's one of the foundations. It may be perceived as left out, to good effect, in some game-sessions, but not as an underlying principle of rpg-design. There must be some measure of open field, to have players make choices that influence the drama.<br/><br/>Respect for the significant differences of the main game-forms within "rpgs" of today is important, and it is mostly present in this forum. To identify classical role-playing games with <i>badwrongfun</i> is as wrong as identifying modern rpgs with <i>dreary social-realism</i>, or story-games with <i>fluff-gaming</i>. We know each of them has these weaknesses, but we also know that the weakness is outmatched by the vast possibilities in each of these game-forms.<br/><br/>But, lets go back to the "open-field simulations of nearly any human condition". This kind of game-play, especially in sandbox-mode (the ultimate "open field"), demands different things from game leaders of today. They need tools to influence the ritual and dialogue of the the games. The players must be helped into the right mood, and helped thematize the conflicts in keeping with the game at hand, wether it's comedy or tragedy. The psychology of the theme must be worked into the interaction.<br/><br/>That is why games of today need to leave the one-sided focus on mechanics aside, and strive to work out <i>a new methodical balance</i> of game-mechanics AND dialogue techniques. We have discussed <i>the art of leading role-playing games</i> (or "GM-craft") since the very start, and those discussions have all been in the field of dialogue techniques; how to ritualize the game, how to empower and engage players, how to feed scenes, how to frame choices and communicate consequences, and so forth ...<br/><br/>It is possible to explore the possibilities of stronger dialogue techniques both in <i>classical rpgs</i> (with a GM), in <i>modern rpgs</i> (without the GM) and in <i>story games</i> (with narrative focus). All of us will be better off for every discovery made in any of these game-forms.<br/><br/>From my vantage point the new awareness of a broader <i>method</i> is THE most interesting development in classical roleplaying games of today. And it is directly linked to all the debates on GM-craft in the seventies, eighties and nineties. I would never have been where I am today, as a GM and designer, without them. The awareness of what role-playing games really are, and what they may achieve, would be so much smaller without those debates. <br/><br/>So I fully understand Jocelyns point; that he wants players and GMs of today to have those debates too, as it has been a great boon to our society, and could still be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille" title="Jocelyn Robitaille"><img alt="Jocelyn Robitaille" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jocelyn%20Robitaille">Jocelyn Robitaille</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337417/#Comment_337417" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T07:38:52+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  7:38AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Jocelyn, I bet this whole conversation would be 306% more productive and fun if you shared some of these techniques or advice, instead.</blockquote>\nI'm not convinced it'd be all that constructive at this moment in time (I get the feeling it has a chance of quickly turning into trad versus story games, misconceptions about stuff, etc.), but I'm willing to try so I've started a thread.<br/><br/>Hopefully, you're right and I'm wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337425/#Comment_337425" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T08:31:29+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  8:31AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/>Respect for the significant differences of the main game-forms within "rpgs" of today is important, and it is mostly present in this forum.

We are a small minority of super-cool, open-minded and evolved gamers surrounded by a vast sea of mainstream.<br/><br/>Montreal is weird.  The mainstream gamers are out there, but they are very hard to find.  On the anglo side, the hardcore mainstream gamers were made up of and centered around the RGPA, but that kind of broke apart when 4e came out.  Since then, we don't know what's happened to them nor how to reach out to them.  We are working on it.<br/><br/>I can tell you that pre-4e days, the RPGA people made up of about a third of the attendees at the local con.  They only played D&amp;D 3.5 in Living Greyhawk (or whereever it was), refused to try any other games or even wander outside their area or circle of gamers they already knew.  I remember I tried to have a conversation with them in the break room.  It went something like this:<br/><br/>Me:  "Hey are you guys psyched about Ptolus?"<br/>One of them [begrudgingly, the rest avoiding eye contact]: "What's Ptolus?"<br/>Me:  "It's the new campaign setting based entirely around a city."<br/>[No response]<br/>Me:  "It's written by Monte Cook."<br/>Them:  "Who's that?"<br/>Me [looking down at the multiple copies of the 3.5 PHB on the table]: "Umm, never mind.

They all recognized each other as playing the same games, and while there was a fair amount of internecine conflict they definitely constituted a single community of play.<br/>2. <b>GURPSies</b>. This was the main group of dissidents, who were down on D&amp;D but basically liked the same kind of highly mechanized and tactical mission-based games. The "cult of the GM" was strong here, but generally this was the domain of people who liked the D&amp;D structure of play but rejected class-and-level mechanics. Shadowrun and HERO were popular among this group too, but GURPS was God.<br/>3. <b>White Wolf players</b> - often ONLY played WW, and a fair minority were devoted to one particular game and edition. Prided themselves on "maturity" and very much believers in System Doesn't Matter in the "we never roll dice" form. Often mechanics-averse, but not always - Exalted in particular brought out system-hackers. Sometimes would dabble in other narrative-forward, atmospheric games, but often found them wanting if they were not strong-GM.<br/>4. <b>Freaks </b>- often either devotees of one particular obscure game, an earlier edition of a popular game, or creators of idiosyncratic homebrew rule sets. Sometimes would play indie or non-trad games, but usually hacked them into unrecognizable forms. Usually had their own small clique of followers, but their only commonality was their disdain for the above three groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337469/#Comment_337469" name="Item_198" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-06T17:36:03+00:00" title="August  6, 2011  5:36PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite><br/>I had a long conversation with a friend/gaming aquaintance from Toronto and a big chunk of it was him lamenting how hard it is to find good gamers and a good gaming community to talk about games in Toronto.  He hangs out on Roludo because of that (and came to the Grand Roludothon).  His main complaint was "everybody plays only D&amp;D".  He runs<a href="http://www.roludo.ca/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=979" rel="nofollow">his games</a>in the traditional style.<br/><br/>So just an example of someone who is a trad gamer, but not a mainstream gamer.</blockquote>\nAll very true.<br/><br/>Well, I'm no expert on the Toronto scene, but there's an even weirder twist here!<br/><br/>There's a large and growing group of people who are really into "indie games"... but don't approach them the way indie gamers generally do. It seems to be an excuse to have games which focus less on combat and get into more freeform roleplay.<br/><br/>Several times, I've heard people say, "Oh, yeah, it's an indie game! That means the rules don't matter! Fantastic!"<br/><br/>I don't really know what to call these people, but it's certainly a very different approach!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

I am going to have to think about it quite a bit before I have anything considered to say, but I do have one observation to make.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a sort of RPG epiphany in 1990, a very good game in which the character-players took over part of what is traditionally the role of the GM. launching major plot developments and adding significant features to the game world. I had a blast, and ever since I have been a proponent of a more collaborative, participatory style of RP gaming, with more authority and responsibility in the hands of the character-players than was then usual, and making the GM more of a participant and less of a presenter. That worked pretty well while I had the particular circle of players with whom I was blessed back then, but since they drifted away I have found that only a few people get what I am driving at. Some reject my explanations, and others agree with my goals but find them paralysingly hard to put into practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could say that I have had the same goal as the Forge movement in trying to derogate the power of the GM in favour of wider collaboration, but that I have always tried to do so through technique rather than through mechanics. The point that is germane to this discussion is that I have not considered the problem to be a lack of technique on the part of myself as GM, but a lack of technique on the part of character-players. I wouldn't so much say that discussions of GMing technique have been lacking since the decline of rec.games.frp.advocacy in the late Nineties\u2014more that the technique of the character-player has never been discussed. There are a lot of people who recognise that there are good GMs and skill at GMing, but far too little recognition that there are good character-players and a considerable body of technique and skills for the character-player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337586/#Comment_337586" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T06:39:24+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  6:39AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Agemegos</cite> There are a lot of people who recognise that there are good GMs and skill at GMing, but far too little recognition that there are good character-players and a considerable body of technique and skills for the character-player.</blockquote>\nThat strikes me as a really interesting point.<br/><br/>I think there has been some good advice out there over time about how to be a good character player, but the bulk of it has centered around character development and portrayal.<br/><br/>What seems lacking is good advice on how to be a good character-player in the context of interaction with the other players, including the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337592/#Comment_337592" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T08:02:34+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  8:02AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>There are a lot of people who recognise that there are good GMs and skill at GMing, but far too little recognition that there are good character-players and a considerable body of technique and skills for the character-player.</blockquote>\nThat strikes me as a really interesting point.<br/><br/>I think there has been some good advice out there over time about how to be a good character player, but the bulk of it has centered around character development and portrayal.<br/><br/>What seems lacking is good advice on how to be a good character-player in the context of interaction with the other players, including the GM.<br/><br/>Oh, yes!<br/><br/>This is one of the key elements in this whole discussion for me.<br/><br/>If there is some sort of GM Mystery Cult (or whatever you want to call it), one of its tenets is to stamp out this kind of heretical thinking.

That's not their job!"<br/><br/>Brett (Agemegos),<br/><br/>I've encountered exactly the same kind of "revelations" and subsequent struggles with people who won't accept the possibility of such techniques... even if they engage in them themselves, they rationalize them away in some other sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337608/#Comment_337608" name="Item_209" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T09:51:51+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  9:51AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think player advice is even more dependant on game and group and the gm, especially in trad games.  There's some general things like be enthusiastic and try and get along with everyone/dont be a dick but I cant think of anything much deeper.<br/>\n<br/>\nOlman,  about sandbox play and trad games I have a couple of opinions.  The first is it's not typical, I wont claim my experience was universal but I rarely ran into sandbox play in fact I've heard about it more on the internet in the last few years then I ever saw it in play.  The second is that in the few cases close to the ideal of sandbox I experienced and in what I've read on the internet holds pretty closely to the gm sets out the goals for play.  He creates a world decides what is and isnt possible on his own before play happens, the players are expected to play to those expectations.  They can go to whichever dungeon they wish, find out what's possible in the inns and taverns and decide where they want to go but if they wanted to do something that the gm hadnt planned he could decide if it was possible or put it off until he prepared something for that.  In any case the expectation was it was the GM's perogative to make it possible or not he was creating the world and what was possible and happening in it.  Compare that to Kickers in Sorceror where the player initiates play, or things like flags that show the players interest and the gm is expected to play towards those.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking a bit further I think there are really at least two components to the trad vs. indie debate.  Playstyle, that I'm comparing above, and mechanical techniques.  I think they are related but not necessarily attached at the hip.  Most of the indie playstyle works fine with the mechanics available in trad games it just may not be supported as well and require more effort from the gm and players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337636/#Comment_337636" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T12:04:14+00:00" title="August  8, 2011 12:04PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>USABILITY</b> is the key to GM advice.<br><br>That's my opinion.<br><br>Just because someone tells me a brilliant way to GM doesn't mean I'll remember it and act on it in the heat/immersion of the moment.<br/><br/>So how do we make our GM advice usable?

Another way is to turn it into play aids (e.g. John Harper's Apocalypse World MC reference sheet) and mnemonics (e.g. Burning Wheel's "Let It Ride").<br/><br/>And then there are all sorts of approaches that are in between, such as instructions and constraints with lots of room for choices within them.<br/><br/>That's the project I'd like for the RPG world to be working on: how to take our thoughts on GMing and really make them matter in play.  We're flooded with GM advice that we can't use, and are rightly wary of it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_337675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337675/#Comment_337675" name="Item_211" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T15:16:33+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  3:16PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><b>USABILITY</b>is the key to GM advice.</blockquote>Important point!
