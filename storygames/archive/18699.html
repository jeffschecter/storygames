I was thinking of playing a Miami Vice style RPG called Miami Knights. It will be either be in the 1980's or now (leaning more toward 80's). Do you all know of "magical vices" that would be illegal if magic was real? Also any laws that people could break using magic? Anything that you could think of for running a magical cop game would be helpful. I know I want magical potions, powders, and charms to be illegal because those things are like drugs to non-magic witches and wizards. I know I want demon summoning to be illegal because demons can be used to do illegal activities. I know I want magic users to be licensed. Beyond that I need your help. There a few things I gleaned from "Dresden Files" RPG but not much else out there.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419840/#Comment_419840" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T11:12:56+00:00" title="August  9, 2013 11:12AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kind of a big topic!

Some of it's going to be illegal, some legal, some helps in doing crime, some determine new types of crime (e.g. computer crime, related to stealing or altering digital data), and so on. Where high security is desired, wielding magic is limited (think metal detectors and body searches), etc. Magical flashlights (that is, magic being a shallow symbolic gloss on modern lifestyle elements) are much easier to use one you realize that that's what you're doing.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419842/#Comment_419842" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T11:53:51+00:00" title="August  9, 2013 11:53AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2013 11:53AM by makrdp.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A useful thing that magic does is broaden the potential targets for crime, trade, and graft: the human soul, health or years of your life, skills, experiences, memories, identity, affordances of the body (childbearing, senses, ability to feel a particular emotion), free will... lots of new nouns, so to speak.<br/><br/>If magic is costly, there will always be people who try to avoid paying the price themselves, either tricking or forcing others to do so in their stead.

Mind altering magic of <i>any</i> form could be deemed subversive or illegal: <b>charm spells</b> would be a top priority for crackdowns, though I wouldn't blame you for not going there. But what about <b>artificial experiences</b>: implanted memories, euphoric mindtweaks, pleasure spells... all these are seedy as hell and full of potential. Can magic be used to kill people? Is <b>death magic</b> a forbidden school, with police divisions dedicated to tracking them down (if so, then those cops must be <i>trained</i> in death magic in order to recognize it, right? Corruption city!).<br/><br/>I guess I'm also thinking that magic is formulas and training. If it's just force of will, that becomes a little more grey-area when it comes to what is and isn't a crime. In our world, it's not illegal to <i>think</i> about committing a crime, but <i>planning</i> one is against the law for sure. If you can shape reality with your mind, at what point does a stray thought become a <i>plan</i>? Maybe that's a question you want to answer in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419858/#Comment_419858" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-09T20:53:45+00:00" title="August  9, 2013  8:53PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent responses so far. I'll add one more, although most of what I thought of immediately has already been covered:<br/><br/>If divination or fortune-telling magic is available (or even time travel-type effects, perhaps consequences traveling backwards through time), it becomes possible to deal with prophecy, crimes which haven't been committed yet, and, of course: the possibility of falsifying all of this same kind of information.<br/><br/>The basic idea is the question of free will: do we make our own choices, or is everything predestined?<br/><br/>"Minority Report" is a good example of this kind of plot in science fiction. It's quite similar with magic, of course:<br/><br/>* Can someone be punished for a crime they've never committed?<br/>* Can someone be held responsible for allowing something which has been prophesied to happen, instead of trying to stop it?<br/>* Falsifying prophecies or the results of divination.<br/>* Is it a violation of human privacy to learn facts about someone else's future?<br/>* How about intellectual property theft?<br/>* If I find out that I'm prophesied to do a Bad Thing (commit a crime, kill someone, be seen at the scene of a terrible crime, etc), and it happens, am I still responsible?<br/><br/>Lots of room here for bizarre conundrums.<br/><br/>Maybe the normal state of things is uncertainty, and we're free to make our own decisions... but prophecies and divination actually lock down the future into some kind of predetermined state?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419876/#Comment_419876" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-10T14:48:13+00:00" title="August 10, 2013  2:48PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2013 3:41PM by Archangel3d.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One suggestion is to pick something and then go way, way, waaaaay overboard, making huge, broad laws with the crux of the matter nestled within layer after layer of preventative and just-in-case legal red tape. Because that's the way laws usually work (ok, ok, slightly cynical). For example, your ban on demon summoning. Make the wording encompass any kind of summoning, not just demons, and make even <i>communicating</i> with demons a crime. That way you have enough "minor" crimes to flesh out the day of the magic cop, stuff that will get you hit with a fine or a reprimand. (Also, lawyers will have a fun time if you happen to talk on the phone with someone who's possessed.

And it would not be the means, but the goals.<br/><br/>Here are magical requests from most common to least common, based on  \u201cDevoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint\u201d by R. Andrew Chesnut (seriously great book, I recommend it - Santa Muerte gained a reputation as a patron saint of gangsters but didn't start as such and is prayed to by a desperate population of people who are too poor to be protected by the legal system, it gives insight on the interaction of religion, magic and law).<br/><br/>- love: ensuring fidelity, forcing your partner to come back, healing a broken heart, stopping family abuse by an aggressive exp-husband (most popular)<br/>- healing, blessing<br/>- money magic<br/>- justice<br/>- finding lost things, acquiring knowledge<br/>- revenge, hurting your enemies (least popular)<br/><br/>Let's take them one by one.<br/><br/>- love magic. "Have them come back to me" or "Have them fall in love with me" - this is mental manipulation worse than rohypnol (because it's meant to be permanent), most definitely illegal. Making yourself more attractive to the other gender would pay HEAVY money though, and would be definitely used by negotiators to unsettle their opponents during business deals. Rape cases would become even more problematic, as would paternity disputes, divorces and so on.<br/><br/>There would probably be therapists specialising in healing trauma of magic victims.<br/><br/>- health magic. Can you imagine the hell that medical practitioners (and insurance companies) would raise over that? It would immediately become strictly regulated, and cost HEAVY money, and any practitioners healing for free or low money would be prosecuted as unfair competition, price dumping etc. Also beauty magic - pheromones, cosmetic surgery (see love magic).<br/><br/>Also, testing athletes for illegal substances would become even more problematic. How can you compete if one athlete trained normally and the other was magically enhanced? How can you even tell if a person was magically enhanced? Does the 'magic residue' ever wear off?<br/><br/>- money magic, generally non-specific, manifesting as inheritance, gifts, finding money, getting raises and unexpected commissions - in the work area it's unfair competition, gifts/finding money is mental manipulation (someone had to lose it/want to give it away first), inheritance is... even more problematic. <br/><br/>Btw, IRL beginner magicians/witches are often told a cautionary tale about how important it is to specify one's request adequately. It goes something like this: "this witch cast a money spell but didn't specify that it was to be with harm to nobody... and she found herself getting money from health insurance after a BIG accident that left her with serious injuries!" - This is obvious insurance fraud.<br/><br/>- justice magic, influencing court decisions. Illegal as hell, attractive as hell.<br/><br/>Also think what that would do to government decisions and how much money would lobbyists pay to have an illegal magic practitioner on their side. Also read up on gang bosses employing magical practitioners.<br/><br/>- acquiring knowledge, divination - could fall under unfair business practices, also intelligence and counter-intelligence agencies would be very interested. (Side note: I loved "Men who stare at goats").
