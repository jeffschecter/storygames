A defined group of people can all see the same document (or a scan/image of a document, but an actual editable document would be best) in real-time.<br/>2. A user-defined set of tokens can be added to the document, removed, and dragged around on their own layer. Preferably these would be added/managed from an on-screen palette/"drawer". There is concurrency management so that only one person can change the document at one time. It would be nice, but hardly necessary, if some of these tokens were "dice" with run-once random values.<br/>3. There can be multiple tabs of this document+tokens environment, and some tabs can contain other things - like an image, or a Google Doc.<br/>4. Requires minimal scripting or tech savvy to set up and operate.<br/><br/>This seems like a "virtual tabletop" kind of solution, but all the ones I have seen are absurdly more complicated than this and make a bunch of assumptions about how they will be used that I don't care about. I have heard of people using VASSAL to do something like this, but I am not interested in the massive learning curve involved in getting to that point.<br/><br/>Basically, what I want is a specialized sort of markup/whiteboard tool with a few special characteristics to use as a reminder of game-state.<br/><br/>Any ideas? Alternatively, educate me about why I want to bother with a VTT?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335218/#Comment_335218" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-19T13:02:36+00:00" title="July 19, 2011  1:02PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 19, 2011 1:03PM by renatoram.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's called "Google Docs Drawing" the only thing missing is the dice roller.<br/><br/><a href="https://renatoram.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/can-you-play-fiasco-online/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://renatoram.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/fiasco_gdocs_table1.jpg"/></a><br/>(to be clear: those are "static" dice, simply copied from the "palette" ones you see at the top)<br/><br/>I've used it to play Misspent Youth, too, with 3 other people.
