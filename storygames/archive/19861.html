Sessions will be managed by a Magus (myself) who scouts out those with the potential for magic, testing them before fully indoctrinating them into the world of magic. These trials take the form of a tabletop RPG in which you play a mental projection of yourself, with the ability to cast Harry Potter Style magic.<br/><br/>You can find more information <a href="https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/18619/wizarding-acceptance-exam" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>, if you are interested.<br/><br/>If you would like to join as a playtester, please message me<br/><br/>Thanks for your time.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
