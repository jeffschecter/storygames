All this sudden stuff about a|state. <br/><br/>In <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3855&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>, some people were talking about under-appreciation of a|state, how I might not appreciate it myself and various bits and bobs about the game. Rather than threadjack, I thoughts I'd start this thread off to comment on some of these reasons behind my current non-commitment to the game and so on.<br/><br/>Matt, Gregor, Mark, Sophie and others who comment on it: thanks very much for your thoughts and insight. a|state, for me, carries a lot of baggage which, for one reason or another, affects how I see the game now.<br/><br/>I am still immensely proud of The City. I love the setting and still look back at elements of it with great satisfaction. OK, it's a mish-mash, a crazy labyrinth of styles, genre tropes and all sorts of bits a bobs, but it represents many of the things I love in films, books, games and so on. People shouldn't get the impression that I don't love the game any more. As my first published design, it's still very much my baby, a child that I will always be close to. That having been said, there are bits that I am dis-satisfied with.<br/><br/>The system is ho-hum at best, due to it being the way that I saw games working when I was writing it. Credit for the change in the way I looked at games design actually deserves to be given to Mr Snyder and Dust Devils. In many ways, I wish I had also given some explanations of why The City is the way it is in the book. Not one 'canon' explanation, but conflicting theories. But, I think it still works as it stands. There is a lot of mystery and adventure there and people are totally free to come up with their own ideas and apply them to their own games. <br/><br/>Why am I no longer as supportive of a|state? The baggage mentioned above has an effect. The biggest one was the Osseum Debacle which, as some people may know, lost us thousands of dollars and caused a hard re-appraisal of the way we (as in those people who collectively make up Contested Ground Studios) do business and sell games. We saw precious little money from the second printing of the game and none from the printing of he only print supplement so far. That hit us (and me) hard. Writing Avenues &amp; Alleyways (as yet unreleased) was also something of a challenge. The main book details 30 areas of The City. A&amp;A details 30 more and trying to come up with areas that were eciting and pregnant with adventure was, in many ways, a challenge. I like to think I set myself high standards and wanted all the writing to be evocative and interesting, to inspire people to use those areas to tell stories in. In the end, I think that's what burned me out a little on writing for the game. It was an intensive process and in the end became frustrating and something of a chore. That's not to say it isn't good. Hell, I think that A&amp;A contains some of the best writing I've ever done: Hammerman Wynds, Grime Rain Stacks, Skank Hill, The Rookery, they are al areas that I believe are worthy additions to the game world. In addition, Paul produced some amazing art for A&amp;A that deserves to be seen. I've always seen Paul as an equal creative partner in the games I do: I do words, he makes the world come alive in a visual way. <br/><br/>So, what? What am I rambling on about? Well, despite everything, I still feel that a|state is a worthy, worthwhile game. I firmly believe that every page of the background has at least one opportunity for story, excitement and interest contained within it. At least one, if not more. There are parts of the setting that still desperately excite me: Mire End, Folly Hills, Long Pond, The Iron Bastion and many more. <br/><br/>a|state isn't dead, I love The City too much for that. I am on a hiatus from it at the moment, concentrating on other games that I want to explore and develop. Cold City is one of those, Everlasting Empire another. But this in no way means I will never return to The City. Maybe a year or two from now I'll start doing a revised edition. Maybe the journey round the world I'm currently on will give me the clarity and space to go back to it. <br/><br/>I hope this honestly answers some of the thoughts and questions people had. If it doesn't, feel free to prod me more.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87288/#Comment_87288" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T11:18:27+00:00" title="August 10, 2007 11:18AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was the Osseum Debacle?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87289/#Comment_87289" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T11:27:51+00:00" title="August 10, 2007 11:27AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Osseum were a fulfillment house that got games out to distributors for us when we first published a|state.

There is too much personal investment in it as a work for me to walk away from it and never look back. I think that any future version of it would, if it came to fruition, still retain the breadth and depth of setting, but also include means by which to focus on the core themes of the setting: the hope and despair that I've always talked about, but which actualy don't have that much influence on the mechanical aspects of the game.<br/><br/>Osseum were excellent when they were handling us. However, their sudden and disastrous breakdown really made it clear that the traditional model of distribution was not for us. Too much risk for too little reward.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Malcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87332">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87332/#Comment_87332" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T14:28:59+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  2:28PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can we get a podcaster to interview Malcolm at Gen Con about his journey, from the creation of a|state, through the Osseum debacle, his experience with Dust Devils, designing Cold City, and his renewed sense of creative purpose?<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87346/#Comment_87346" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T15:02:42+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  3:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>Can we get a podcaster to interview Malcolm at Gen Con about his journey, from the creation of a|state, through the Osseum debacle, his experience with Dust Devils, designing Cold City, and his renewed sense of creative purpose?<br/></blockquote>\nOr we can just get an audio clip of him reading his first post.

I think the reason is that I had a journey with it. For a long time it sat there on my shelf, I knew it was a game of mystery, wonder, excitement. It was probably one of the best settings I had read in years. It made me want to run something.<br/><br/>But what?<br/><br/>Eventually a poster to RPGnet called Ryan L put up his actual play of a campaign he called "Eye of the Needle". At that point I knew what a/state would be for me. I saw his ideas, saw the ideas in the book and then found mine.<br/><br/>And then I wrote, and wrote and wrote. Until I had a book full of notes. Then I ran it, and that group just did not get the game. Then I found another group and ran it for them. And they got it, and they went for it. And it was good.<br/><br/>It is for this reason I want more a/state. Anything would do. But especially a system that really pushes the community angle of the game.<br/><br/>However, there is baggage. At the moment I understand baggage, I have come to a decision recently that is all about accepting and moving on from baggage. <br/><br/>Good luck with what ever you are doing.
