Mechanically, it's pretty light and easy. Character creation, for ex, shouldn't take more then 10 minutes.  It seems to be designed with one shots in mind and there's a cool mechanical reward for killing off your character (basically your replacement character is even more of a badass). It is one of those games that encourages frugal use of dice rolls by basically making most things automatically succeed (unless there would be an interesting failure) particularly when it comes to mooks. So that fight scene against the 88? That's simply described. <br/><br/>A lot of it seems to require familiarity/buy-in with the source material although for my money, I think it's the perfect fit for cartoony G.I.Joe action (I think this is heavily hinted at in the book) as well. <br/><br/>I'm gonna bring it to my next local con and give it a run.

Like those Film/TV series where everyone is ostensibly not a crazy superhero type, and yet the protagonists are just overall better than a regular person at pretty much everything.

"Give me two dice" and then I give you two dice is something that's easy and intuitive to understand; "Give me two dice," "Fuck you!", lose two dice, and take any number of Team dice, though, was a dynamic that took us a while to catch on to. <br/><br/>The dice mechanic is easy to grok, but it was hard to feel like a hyper-competent bad-ass when I'm rolling, say, 3d6 and the GM's rolling 15d6. Best-case scenario, I have one set, whereas Hamish typically had at least four or five sets in a round. Most of the time it felt like we were barely keeping our collective head above water. I guess the expectation was that we'd make use of the Team dice more, but as a player I think we had a pretty strong instinct to "save them until later when we'll really need them," even if none of us ever said that aloud. I can imagine a scenario where we're amazing ass-kickers for the first couple of scenes, thanks to a calculated combination of the phrases "Give me two dice!" and "Fuck you!", but I don't see how we wouldn't necessarily fall apart in the middle or end of the story, which seems contra-indicated by the source material. <br/><br/>Hamish told us going in that it'd be "Jason Statham the RPG." I don't think he was wrong about that, but based on that one experience I'd qualify it as "Jason Statham in <i>Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels</i> the RPG." I like the mechanics and the kind of story it is likely to produce; I just don't think it ended up being the kind of story we <i>thought</i> we were going to produce.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342240/#Comment_342240" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T11:22:36+00:00" title="September 11, 2011 11:22AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One <i>big</i> mistake I made, was letting you roll those two early DIG checks; that added 4 dice to the difficulty.

You're right, it was a base of 3-5 dice each, because we more or less ignored our bottom two or three stats if we could at all help it. The result was that each of us felt we had one or two things we could do reasonably well, and virtually no chance of success at anything else. Unless...\n<blockquote>Plus traits if you bring them in. </blockquote>\n...we use a limited resource, which, again, not knowing the game at all, I think a lot of us were loathe to do, in case we needed it more later in a climactic scene. And if you only have 2 or less in a stat-thingy, you have to burn two traits just to have a fightin' chance of getting a set.<br/><br/>I tend to have a "go for it" attitude with convention games, so I used at least four of my traits, but I'm pretty sure not everyone was so free with them. I get the feeling you're supposed to consider your character fairly disposable, what with there being almost no consequence for character death (you just respawn as a better guy), but then if we're all constantly dying and getting replaced... there's a distinct sense that we may not, in fact, be the bad-asses we thought we were.<br/><br/>And there's no accounting for bad rolls, obviously. I think Morgan repeatedly rolled 6-7 dice and got a single set out of it. Or for good rolls, on the GM's end. You, uh, you rolled pretty well, most of the time. That's how it seemed, anyway.\n<blockquote><br/>Because of my DIG error, I was rolling 14 dice in the first conflict (the Rooster added dice too), 14 dice in the second, and 16 in the last. </blockquote>\nAh. See, it doesn't seem there like we had such a huge advantage, then, especially earlier in the game when we were still willing to take a chance on a lower-rated trait. Later on, when we wised up a bit, it seemed like everything each of us did was framed in terms of one of our two highest-rated stats. <br/><br/>Yeah, I know. Team dice!\n<blockquote><br/>It should have been a DIG scene with 8 dice (maybe 10 depending on what you did), 12 dice in the cliff scene, 12 in the interrogation attack and 14 in the last.

Like Fiasco, Hollowpoint's a game I'd really like to try again now that I "get it" a little more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342313/#Comment_342313" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T17:47:00+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  5:47PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting.  Forgive me for sprinkling a little AP here as I don't think any of the players are on SG.  <br/>I ran a 1930's gangster/untouchables style Hollowpoint at Saga Minicon last Sunday for the first time.  Fun was generally had by all, and everyone expressed a willingness to try again, thinking things would go smoother with better system understanding.  Some expressed a preference for Leverage in the "Team of Bad People take on a Mission" genre.  Which is an excellent game.<br/><br/>We had 5 players, which I think stretches the mechanics in some interesting ways when it comes to Catches.  Catches are a wrinkle in the scene, a side objective that HAS to be completed before the opposition is eliminated, or else the scene is failed.<br/><br/>I ran 3 catches in the game, but no simple skill tests.  One catch to 'find the bookies ledgers and use them as leverage to get your info before the place gets raided' was weak sauce.  Why was the numbers house being raided?  I mostly wanted to try out the Catch mechanic.  This was unnecessary, as we later had to 'locate the kidnapped heiress in the Speakeasy before she is spirited away' and finally 'rescue the hostage before you've killed everyone'  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  That last one was fun, the group of killers was sick and tired of the rescue mission (in character) by this point and set out to kill the kidnappers.  I innocently suggested it sounded like they might not be being too careful at this point and the hostage could get caught in the crossfire unless they extracted her first.  Good times.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>The group failed all the Catch scenes- which I think had a lot to do with dice rolling (6,6,6 to find the hostage, 6,5,5 to rescue her, when I rolled seven 1s meaning the opposition was fast but fragile) but also to do with the number of characters (generally 3-4) contributing dice to reducing the opposition rather than working on the catch- so they whittled down my pairs very quickly in each round, failing to accomplish the catch before eliminating the opposition.<br/><br/>The learning point from that is to allocate enough resources to achieve the Catch- especially in early scenes (I only had 2 or 3 sets from my remaining 7 dice).  On the other hand, in Hollowpoint, failing scenes means largely whatever the table agrees it means, the mission will continue somehow.  So maybe it's not such an issue.<br/><br/>Hardly any Traits were burned, nor many Team dice used, but lots of help was asked for and granted.  This sounds like an issue for novice Hollowpointers that could perhaps be addressed by clearer explanations.  One player 'got' traits when I said (during the game) they were links to your humanity that you're burning to complete the mission.<br/><br/>So in answer to Grahams question, I think the answer is Yes, it is a good game (for my gaming interests).  There are however intricacies and richness within the dice mechanics that are not immediately obvious, which may not appeal if you like that side more transparent.   Death meaning 'respawn' and also a chance to 'win' also seems baked into the system maths in some interesting ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/max.lambertini" title="max.lambertini"><img alt="max.lambertini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lambertini.org/foto_max_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/max.lambertini">max.lambertini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342361/#Comment_342361" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T02:12:11+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  2:12AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I run a game of Hollowpoint yesterday at GnoccoCon, Reggio Emilia, Italy. <br/><br/>My games was a take on old Cyberpunk 2020 game: players were a Special Response team hired by Arasaka to find out why a whole building floor filled with Arasaka salarymen went "Reaver" (yes, the ones from Serenity/Firefly) and find and punish the culprits. <br/><br/>I had three players on my table, and all of them knew little about the game. <br/><br/>Mechanics took some time to grasp, but after two/three trials, we had no problems sorting sets and using them in game. <br/><br/>However, due to a misunderstanding of the "hit" mechanics from my side, conflicts took longer than expected. After game, I took some time (a precious and dwindling resource in my life these days) to read (and re-read, and re-re-read) actual play sessions, and I found out why. My bad :-( <br/><br/>Players took full advantage of traits, and asked for help three times. No one "won", three players went from Agents to Operatives, and created traits "on the fly". We had some awesome scenes, indeed. <br/><br/>I think Hollowpoint is a good game, and some faults from my side (GM) prevented the session from going more smoothly. <br/><br/>These faults were:<br/><br/>* The Setting we chose -- I had two Solo's and one Netrunner -- and most of time my players ended up relying on their signature Ability (namely, KILL for the Solo's and DIG for the Netrunner). <br/>* As I stated before, some misinterpretations from my side. Next game I'm gonna make me some nifty graph-viz flowcharts to ease GM'ing...<br/><br/>Things we all liked of the game were:<br/><br/>* The dice mechanic. We ended up liking it, and by the end of the session, with some clever help bidding and trait burning, it was like having a small game within the game.<br/>* The dice-driven narration. It just works :-) <br/>* Its versatility. <br/><br/>All in all, I'm looking forward to having the chance for another Hollowpoint Game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cczernia" title="cczernia"><img alt="cczernia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zerneeak.com/avatar_mini.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cczernia">cczernia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342390/#Comment_342390" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T08:55:30+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  8:55AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had fun but felt like there were some disconnects in the fiction and the mechanics. I also felt like there should be some ultra-violence but the game went a lot smoother when there wasn't any violence. The teamwork mechanics are essential but the best way to get teamwork is to refuse it. What exactly is happening there in the fiction? I think the best way to imagine this game is the first Mission Impossible movie where everyone dies in the beginning but two members and they have to replace the team. So, more Tom Cruise than Jason Statham :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342391/#Comment_342391" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-12T09:25:55+00:00" title="September 12, 2011  9:25AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Wait.
