However, John brings his girlfriend Sarah. They play, <i>continuing from last time <b>in some sense</b></i> Not necessarily chronological order - it might be same characters, different characters, different location, something seemingly unrelated but with thematic links, I dunno.<br/><br/>Saturday, John and Sarah are alone together, but are still so buzzed about the game that they want to play more - so they do, by themselves, the two of them - but again in some sense, it's still the same game.<br/><br/>Tuesday, James, William and mutual friend Sam meet up for something unrelated, but they play a bit of the game anyway. Again, it's still somehow linked.<br/><br/>Is this possible? Can one have a discontinuous group and maintain a continuous "game", and if so in what sense? Where can the continuity be located, if no one person is there for all sessions?<br/><br/>I want this, in a real sense, especially for online play. But I wonder where the boundary between separate games and all one game truly lies. What is continuity, anyway? Why do we want it? Is it a vital part of proceedings, or can it be bent and twisted or even disregarded in the service of our social purpose, which is to play the game, here, now, with the people available at the time?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167664/#Comment_167664" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T06:29:09+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  6:29AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that's a pretty cool question.<br/><br/>In a way, it's like asking whether any institution is continuous.

But is even that necessary? Could we go further still, and have a game that is continuous only in the minds of it's players as long as they last? A game handed down like oral history is handed down, in which each player's prejudices inform the "history" that is told to the next players, and so on down the line through generational replacement....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167680/#Comment_167680" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T06:59:21+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  6:59AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>Is this possible?

We play TSoY pretty regularly and it works out fine - our games have a broad general arc to them and character-focused stuff happens in discrete sessions, so the guy who is missing sort of fades to black and it doesn't monkey-wrench anything.

We've had Uni sessions which have added new players or were missing previous players, yet were still part of the same continuity.  The hard part is recordkeeping -- whenever a session starts, regardless of who is present to play, the records of the existing continuity have to be available so that players know what is going on.  In games with a GM, the 'keeper of the continuity' is of course the GM.  In Universalis, it could be anybody, or everybody, depending on the group.<br/><br/>I've experimented with writing out the events of our Uni game in a fashion similar to a movie script (with a column of initials and coin expenditures down one side) so that it could be read by the players before the next session.  That's something that would be easier for a chat room game -- the chat log <i>is</i> the script.  Or, it could be set up as a wiki.  <br/><br/>I like Meserach's idea of an oral history, though; the story gets told to people, and then they play the game and add to the tale, and what the previous players remembered and felt was important is what retroactively becomes true.  It would be a viral meme, spread by word of mouth.  <br/><br/>Thread drift:  (Game as virus -- the game seeks to reproduce itself, 'infecting' new players, who then become the vectors for the spread of the virus to new hosts...)<br/><br/>The main problem I see with the oral history model is that as the story gets longer and more complex, and has more side-stories that have been explored, and more events and interconnections to remember (and forget), the players will eventually have to become epic storytellers like Homer -- able to recite the entire Odyssey from memory.<br/><br/>Which is not a bad thing, really...<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167714/#Comment_167714" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T09:19:50+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  9:19AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>And this is pretty much every ongoing LARP ever made.

What forces ensure continuity between one LARP event and the next? Are there people who's job it is to record everything and settle historical arguments? Are records kept, and if so, what do they record, how, and in what detail? And how are those records then used? What would the LARP be like if some or all of that effort was not put in? What stuff is kept continuous, and what stuff isn't worried about? How, if at all, are all the players kept up to date as to the prior history and current events?

I imagine many groups do also try and hold their worlds constant, and have NPCs recurring, and gradually asemble a history and geography and other such.... but what if only the character was constant, and they traversed not only to new stories but new worlds with new genres and new physics...<br/><br/>But there's more territory to explore here, in terms of what's held continuous and what isn't. How about a game in which the characters were always new each time, but the world stayed constant from session to session? That probably would require a written record or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167724/#Comment_167724" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T09:57:33+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  9:57AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>And this is pretty much every ongoing LARP ever made.

After all, the people to whom the details mattered have moved on...<br/><br/>JD may well have a different experience from mine. For me, very few people actually did know everything that happened, including the Story-Tellers and assistants. Basically, the more often you were involved with the weekly LARP session, the more likely you were to know most of what was going on.<br/><br/>Likewise, the more regularly present you were the more likely you were to be tapped to join "the staff".<br/><br/>This, in turn, meant you were more likely to be able to work events you were interested in into the game as "official" parts of the story, either as a player, or an ST.<br/><br/>The next closest thing I saw was unofficial Cell-Structure. Usually, one of your RL acquaintances/pals who you gamed with would be really, really into the LARP, even if you weren't. They would act as your contact, keeping you (and other friends) up-to-date on the LARP events. Since they were really into the game, they'd often be "tapped" either to act as staff or to enact ST generated events, or as a source for reporting in-game events to STs.<br/><br/>Again, my experience with LARPS is limited to on-going casual VampLARPs, inevitably played at bars with a fair amount of drinking involved, and usually a couple dozen regular players and perhaps 2-3 times that casual players. Other styles of LARP do differ significantly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167749/#Comment_167749" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T11:22:12+00:00" title="September  8, 2008 11:22AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2008 11:22AM by Ry.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My IAWA game is exactly like this.

So I'll just talk about <i>my own</i> LARPs.<br/><br/>In Paragons, a Vampire game, I kept notes on the event, and on 'the circle'.  The circle went like this:  At the end of each event, the players formed up into a big circle, and I'd have bits like "On the count of three, point to the player whose character provoked you most to action this game."  Then I'd get explanations, and give pointed-at people more XPs.  The notes I made on these things, I fleshed out a bit, and printed up each event along with the character sheets (on the back, actually), as a kind of "rumor sheet".<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>In Dustbowl Prophets, I kept a "Rumor Deck", a giant stack of business cards.  One of the very very common abilities in the game was the ability to draw seven cards from the deck, read 'em, and then put seven back.  However, you didn't have to put back the same seven; you could throw some of the ones you drew away (or all of 'em), make up new ones, and shuffle them in.  I started the deck loaded each night with little notes about the previous event, which I <i>deliberately </i> distorted.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Sea-changed, which I'm starting in the next month, and have already started group prep on, will use both kinds of continuity, and also has a facebook group and a wiki.  It hasn't hit play yet, and the tools are mutating, by my general idea there is that rather than producing the "canon", it's better if I work on ensuring open lines of communication and coordination, and to ensure that those same lines have lots of room (maybe even some rewards) for one-to-one or one-to-many communications about what is and isn't in the group fiction.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Every game I've ever played also saw the "informal cells" that Robert mentioned upthread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167810/#Comment_167810" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T16:26:35+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  4:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            kbob is about right.

On the other hand, I had to give up the sense of having my game, because if I had a pre-written idea of what was over the next hill then my players wouldn't be as free to jam.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167946/#Comment_167946" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T09:05:01+00:00" title="September  9, 2008  9:05AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had the same problem as you. The way I fixed it:<br/><br/>- I adopted the concept of TV series (is there a plural?) episodes. So each session is an episode. You don't expect that everyone would sit through it. So every session has a beginning and an and with its own climax, cliffhanger, etc. And the episodes can be enjoyed separately without knowing the former episodes. (I know it became a trend to have story arcs in American TV since B5 and it's an old tradition of British TV for example in Dr. Who, but most of the time even those series have self-contained episodes. But if it bothers you, think rather about A-team or Knight Rider or Mission Impossible.)<br/><br/>- The big difference between a TV series and RPG is that you know exactly who "watches". So while a TV series has to have continuity (no, it doesn't, but the audience likes to think that it's a complex world, so the writers try to write continuous episodes) all the time, because there is a possibility that there will be at least one person who sits through the whole series, you know exactly wich episodes can have references to wich former episodes and wich doesn't have to.<br/><br/>- We can call that half-continuity. Because if you have person A and B playing in one episode and person C and D playing in another, the two episodes can be totally contradictuous. But if there's a third episode with B and C or any mixed possibility, than it has to be continuous regarding to both of the former episodes. (For example if A and B stole a jewel, than C and D can steal the same jewel and B and C can protect the jewel. Episode I and II contradicts each other, but episode III references both.)<br/><br/>- And if you are arrived here, than you can go further. If the players forget something, you can do as it never happened. Really, that works and it's awesome. For example once I GMed a session where I didn't want an NPC to interfere. The players forgot about that he was there, so I just didn't mention them that he's at hand until the next session.<br/><br/>Remember, it's a game and what happens won't be set in stone. The joy comes from what happens right now and not what story comes out. The players will even remember different stories than it was in reality. So, continuity really doesn't matter. If the players are somewhat open-minded, than even if they were present and remember, even then it can be refreshing to screw the continuity.<br/><br/>(If you are interested, I specially use this format: The PCs are agents of an organization and they get missions from them. I tell the players what their mission is and start the adventure in medias res at the first important scene where something happens. I ask them before the session till when the players have time and I use an independent factor based on realtime to press them on. (A mighty enemy closing in or a poison having effect.) I use forced scene framing to make sure that the climax will happen in the current session. I'm having a continuous story arc for my own joy, but make changes depending upon wich players will be present at the next session. And if I have to choose between continuity and what can be made joyfully in the next session, than I rather have the latter.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167998/#Comment_167998" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T11:34:35+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 11:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I remember you saying that, Filip.<br/><br/>Clearly we must now duel to the death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168124/#Comment_168124" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T23:45:14+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 11:45PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read a bit about IAWA and being the stingy bastard that I am homebrewed a game that resembles it.

The rules of the game make sure that at least one, but usually two or even three, characters are shared between different sessions.

Here's my suggestion:<br/><br/>Keep a piece of paper, a wiki, or similar. After the each session, write down a couple of questions, like "What will happen to X?", "Who was behind the mysterious Y?" and "How did Z get so disillusioned?". Start every session (except the first, of course) by deciding on one or a couple of questions to answer during play. Someone will probably know enough about the background to some questions, and can fill the others in. then finish by writing down some more questions. Cross out the answered questions, or actually write down the answers if you want a written record.<br/><br/>You can make huge leaps in time ("What civilization left those ruins behind?"), or small ones, and after a number of sessions, you've got a big interconnected story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168185/#Comment_168185" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T07:13:34+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  7:13AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who needs continuity at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168197/#Comment_168197" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T07:52:27+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  7:52AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not a need at all, but it is a matter of taste and a lot of people like it as a story element.

A good example is D&amp;D: the cleric misses a night and you either roll in a sock-puppet NPC or you start to bend the game plans to suit lack of healer support. Or the Shadowrun Decker: he's out, and suddenly you have missions to sites with no cyber security, or missions well outside of the techosphere where cyberspace is ubiquitous. And there's the whopper: a GM with critical secrets to apportion (highly GMful games that rely on surprise for much of their fun)--she misses a session, and it's often either "pick up game" time or a-whole-nother arc (even with new characters!) must be born by a substitute GM.<br/><br/>Everything after those elements is logistics, be it communicative (how do we keep everyone on the same page, story- or event-wise?) or practical (where do we game when our usual host can't participate?). One can resolve each of those using any one (or a combination of) a host of techniques and technologies, many of which were mentioned above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168230/#Comment_168230" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T09:02:35+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  9:02AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some people have tried to deal with this by having a (in-fiction) setup that can explain the come-and-go of characters.

The way we play it, there's no fixed GM and no character ownership. All that changes from session to session. There's not much that needs to transfer between sessions -- mainly the different places we've fucked up (we've blown up half the city by now). Since one session = one mission, it's easy to motivate changes in the group.
