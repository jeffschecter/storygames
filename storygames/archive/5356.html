I know it's partly because George may be the protagonist, despite that his scenes seem much like frames around the childrens' scenes.  Is the overall conflict between George and the children or between George and Mary?  Mary seems more like a mediator than an antagonist, though she is almost always in some minor conflict with whomever she happens to be with at the time.  Even when she's alone with Bert, it's her platonic feelings vs. his romantic ones.<br/><br/>The story feels super-dimensional.<br/><br/>And I know it's <i>not</i> intrinsic to its being a "nanny" or "interloper" story.  By way of example, <i>Sound of Music</i>, though a great story, is a relatively simple chain of escape from vocation to family; and <i>Nanny McPhee</i> is...well..a thin veil of story over childish slapstick.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I started a little off track it seems.  Beyond the peculiar literary feeling that I'd expect a focused <i>Mary Poppins</i> game to invoke, there could be a lot of options to explore for how to just <i>play</i> with the idea, using games already available.<br/><br/>Each family could be like the epicenter of a Town in DitV.<br/><br/>Each Nanny could bring along their own Shock:s and change what it means to be family.<br/><br/>Each child could express in their advert letter what they need from a Nanny, and the Nanny is kind of like a group of toys from Under the Bed.<br/><br/>You could have two competing Nannies (and Bert and Mary do seem to compete for the job, don't they?) played by two opposing players, and The Children and The Parents played by two other opposing players, and do a sort of Polaris-style rotation.<br/><br/>And I'm <i>sure</i> someone will pop up with some IAWA idea.  I haven't looked at it yet, but it seems to be all the rage.<br/><br/>You could even D&amp;D Mary Poppins.  Just throw a Mary Poppins as a questing device into a heroism vs. stability conflict between the player characters and their ruler, while making treasure important to each side of that conflict.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Something is itching but not quite clicking for me concerning how the <i>Mary Poppins</i> story can feel like such a robust, flexible source for gaming.  What I can't tell is if I'm seeing the edges of some general principle or if this is just the gestalt effect of a really good story.<br/><br/>But if you're interested enough, then tell me, how would <i>you</i> play the game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120434/#Comment_120434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T12:53:14+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 12:53PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Burr</cite>But if you're interested enough, then tell me, how would<i>you</i>play the game?</blockquote>\nThere would be more shotguns and kung fu.  And London would be ruled by a Tyrant Vampire who oversees a ghoul army.
