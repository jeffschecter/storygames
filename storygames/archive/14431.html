Last Saturday, along with my wife and his sister, we dusted off the tome and made merry with Graham's game.<br/><br/>Ben read through a handful of passages and incorporated the major rule points as well as noting some of the color in the writing.  Maybe with 10 mins of review, we were ready to roll.  <br/><br/>The generated characters were three family members (the Whitehead family) and one servant girl (Becca).  The game has a two act structure: the first providing color and game-stuff to propel the second act where one of the characters is found murdered and the secrets and lies are dialed up.<br/><br/>Our story.  Aged widower and survivor of the Boer wars, Bunny Whitehead held court over his foppish and closeted son, German spy sister-in-law Dotty, and her assistant Becca whom everyone was sleeping with.  the skeletons come out over the first act.  At the beginning of the second act, Becca's name is drawn from the "kill jar" and she is found in the dining room stabbed to death.  In the end, all the Whiteheads were found with enough baggage to have killed the poor girl a dozen times over, but the inspector ultimately found that the rakish young Mr. Whitehead\u2013having been blackmailed by Becca who saw him frequently sprint off to his "men's clubs" in fair London town\u2013was the only one of the suspects that could have possibly lifted the dead girl onto the table.<br/><br/>We all liked the game and we would definitely play it again.  It was quick, clocking in at 3hrs10mins.  But as i hadn't actually read the rules (rather than having been told the highlights) there was a little confusion about tone and procedure.  I'm not sure that they aren't inherent in the game so i'm opening my questions here, with notes...<br/><br/>- in the opening act, the players engage each other in a series of accusations.  npcs are not encouraged which means there's nothing but pc interaction.  the scene would play out until one person pointed at the other with a leading question.  when i play this again, i'd like to try it with an "accusation" marker of some sort in front of the players so that i knew immediately at a glance which players had been exhausted for that round.<br/><br/>- I'd love to hear more about the Group Scene that is supposed to be the sort of holding conversation from which the pcs corner each other and calve off into private scenes.  It was a good corral for character interaction but it never worked very well in play for us.  what were we missing here?<br/><br/>- In the 2nd act, a character is chosen from a nominated pool of votes to be the murdered character.  That player becomes the Inspector.  The players are still choosing either color or investigative scenes with each other but the investigator is only allowed to choose one scene per round.  For us this meant that the dead player/investigator really took a back seat in the second act.  Is that normal play?  Is there some other way to shoehorn the investigator into more play in the second Act?<br/><br/>- From the bits i gleaned, Graham goes a long way in the text towards introducing and affirming that the language should be more English and period in its usage.  So my final question is of tone.  As we were building our list of suspicious allegations for each character (the list of horrible things you've done, resultant from the Investigative Scenes in Act 2) it became clear to each player that we'd already touched on much of the horrible in the First Act.  At the end of Act 1 we already knew that David Whitehead was cross-dressing and meeting men in London; that Bunny had had a homosexual relationship with his African guide as a youth, Dorothy was collecting data for the Kaiser and that Becca was carrying her father's (bunny) illegitimate heir.  This left us precious little space to not go space monkey yarn cannon with the complications in the second Act.  <br/><br/>Should the First Act comprised of more unresolved, unspoken hissing?  What have been your experiences.<br/><br/><br/>I'm looking forward to giving this game another play with some refinement learned from my first outing.  Much fun.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328189/#Comment_328189" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T08:53:03+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  8:53AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Double King</cite>when i play this again, i'd like to try it with an "accusation" marker of some sort in front of the players so that i knew immediately at a glance which players had been exhausted for that round.</blockquote>\nYes, I've taken to doing this when I play it. It works well. (Each player has a token. When they make an Influence or Investigation attempt in a scene, they discard the token.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Double King</cite><br/>- In the 2nd act, a character is chosen from a nominated pool of votes to be the murdered character.

But they can still push themselves and put the cat among the pigeons by asking pointed questions, especially in the group scenes. It's also fun to play the upper-class family doing their best to dismiss this mere workman, Chapel.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Double King</cite>Should the First Act comprised of more unresolved, unspoken hissing?  What have been your experiences.</blockquote>\nYou have to keep a lid on it to some extent. In the First Act, it's about trying to gain Influence dice over the other PCs, so you should be trying to get them to do things. In the Second Act, the Investigations are about revealing unpleasantness in the relationship between the PC and the victim, in order to give the PC a motive for the murder. So, David is a cross-dressing queer? Fine, but why would that make him want to murder Becca the servant? Also, don't forget that the first stage of each relationship is public knowledge.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328191/#Comment_328191" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T08:59:46+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  8:59AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil</cite>The Inspector can only initiate one Investigate action per round.

The <i>language</i> needn't be English. Please, please don't feel constrained by period language. It's the <i>tone</i>.<br/><br/>There are two things going on here. The first comes from a very specific problem. When Americans play this game, they have a habit of being blunt and honest. They start scenes by saying "Why did you sleep with my wife?". This is game-breaking, because it means nobody can earn the Black and White dice. So you must be English in raising these subjects. Start by talking about the garden, then mention that, last Saturday, I saw someone who looked like you in the tea-shop in town. And I could have sworn my wife was there. Obviously, there's probably a rational explanation, but I wanted to run it past you, as it were. And so on.<br/><br/>The second adds richness to the game. This game works well when there's a tension between comedy and seriousness, between etiquette and violence, and so forth. Burn down the house and then yell apologies at your mother.\n<blockquote>As we were building our list of suspicious allegations for each character (the list of horrible things you've done, resultant from the Investigative Scenes in Act 2) it became clear to each player that we'd already touched on much of the horrible in the First Act.

This left us precious little space to not go space monkey yarn cannon with the complications in the second Act.</blockquote>\nMan, I can escalate those easily.<br/><br/>David is not just cross-dressing and meeting men in London, but beat a rent-boy to death on Clapham Common after contracting syphilis from him. Bunny didn't just have a homosexual relationship with his African guide: the relationship is still going on and, all these years, the guide has been postmaster of a nearby village. Dorothy is not just collecting data for the Kaiser, but has specifically offered the country house as a training school for the Nazis once they inevitably conquer Britain. Becca is carrying her father's illegitimate heir: the father is her brother, with whom she has had an incestuous relationship since the age of 14.<br/><br/>The game deliberately pushes you to think of worse horrors. You can go very, very nasty with them: it constrasts beautifully with the overt politeness. Now, admittedly, you probably shouldn't start with mass murder. But you can start nasty and still get worse. (That's the point.)<br/><br/>(One danger: although you can establish backstory in the early scenes, try not to focus <i>too</i> much on building it. It can get in the way of Investigations, later.)\n<blockquote>in the opening act, the players engage each other in a series of accusations. npcs are not encouraged which means there's nothing but pc interaction.</blockquote>\nTry to screw each other over. Get people to do things they don't want to do. Force someone to break an engagement or sign over their business to you. <br/><br/>The accusation marker sounds good.\n<blockquote>I'd love to hear more about the Group Scene that is supposed to be the sort of holding conversation from which the pcs corner each other and calve off into private scenes. It was a good corral for character interaction but it never worked very well in play for us.</blockquote>\nIt does two things, really. Firstly, it's an opportunity to do silly period stuff as a group: croquet, dinner, bridge. You play around with etiquette and talk in character. It's just a bit of fun.<br/><br/>Secondly, it's an opportunity to see the fallout from previous scenes. Thus, if we had a fight, we cast suspicious glances at each other over the dinner table. If I slept with your husband, I make innuendos at you. If we are flirting, we flirt. And so on.<br/><br/>Don't push it too hard. Often, in the later part of the game, the focus is on investigation, so group scenes become more perfunctory. If you want to do scenes, do scenes.\n<blockquote>In the 2nd act, a character is chosen from a nominated pool of votes to be the murdered character. That player becomes the Inspector. The players are still choosing either color or investigative scenes with each other but the investigator is only allowed to choose one scene per round. For us this meant that the dead player/investigator really took a back seat in the second act.</blockquote>\nYeah...the Inspector can be difficult.<br/><br/>It works best when the Inspector is a strong character, even a caricature, whom the player <i>really</i> enjoys playing. So much of the pleasure is playing a big, big character. <br/><br/>Often, the Inspector will be a dominant <i>character</i>, on whom attention focusses, but won't actually dominate <i>play</i>. So the Inspector strides in and throws accusations around, but nevertheless, everyone can go and do Investigation and Influence scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328363/#Comment_328363" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T20:03:11+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  8:03PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2011 8:05PM by Double King.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Oh, hang on.

I hadn't meant to mimic the period as much as the intent and the general flavor or Brit subtlety that is a bit rarefied on this side.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Man, I can escalate those easily.<br/><br/>David is not just cross-dressing and meeting men in London, but beat a rent-boy to death on Clapham Common after contracting syphilis from him.

We weren't playing the game correctly then.  The way I understood the escalation during the Investigative scenes was that each of those offending comments pertained to the dead person (in our case Becca).  So then in the First Act we'd had some piece of business described about Becca; the character dies; and every time you've lost an investigative scene in the Second Act you're escalating your divisive relation to Becca.  Which is where we began to tap out on over the top and yet plausible narrative tropes to pursue.  If i understand you correctly, you're saying that you should just push on the absurd and horrible within each individual character.  nice.\n<blockquote>The accusation marker sounds good.</blockquote>\nThanks.  Also, something i'm likely to try next game is to omit the voting on which player to kill and rather just randomize all the characters at the table.  It's a subtle difference but it eliminates a sort of determining mindset about "which character has just got to go". [edit: although, perhaps that is just your intent after all?]\n<blockquote>Yeah...the Inspector can be difficult.<br/><br/>It works best when the Inspector is a strong character, even a caricature, whom the player<i>really</i>enjoys playing. So much of the pleasure is playing a big, big character.</blockquote>\nSome addl thoughts on the Inspector.  I'd like to find a way to shoehorn in some monologuing by him... maybe for every scene he/she wins there should be some snort of exposition?  Secondly, it seemed like the Inspector dice ruled our Second Act predominantly.  I might try the next game by starting him out with one die to begin with.<br/><br/>[Graham let me know if there's a way to somehow combine my Cthulhu pre-support with a supplemental copy of this game.  I should have my own copy of 'A Taste for Murder.'  Ps. I know others have lauded you for stealing away with the Penguin style for art direction and thought i would affirm that it is one sharp cover.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328393/#Comment_328393" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T01:20:06+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  1:20AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Double King</cite>This is revelatory.
