His attention was on his scope, that little portion of the world that leapt up to greet him when he put his eye against soft rubber.  He was covered head to foot in a ghillie suit and far enough from the encampment that he would look like another patch of knotted foliage in the jungle covering this steep incline.<br/><br/>The others were far below him, working their way forward with their own camouflage in place.  If he dipped his scope he could see them, but only just.  The men in the encampment would know nothing of their approach.<br/><br/>Two men guarded the main entrance to the guerrilla camp.  They stood beside an open-topped green Jeep that had to be thirty years old.  One smoked a cigarette.  When the others drew close enough, Cutter would snuff both men out and allow the team to move forward undeterred.  If they were spotted after that it would free fire, covering the team from half a mile away.  He would be the angel on their shoulders, as essential as every man on the ground.</i><br/><br/>No, this is not a revival of my old thread, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11135" rel="nofollow">Of snipers and ninja</a>, but there could be some crossover.  If you're interested to find out, have a read.<br/><br/>I've been on something of a sniper kick recently, though I can't say exactly why.  Probably because of the intriguing possibilities of the Xbox 360 game, <a href="http://www.sniperghostwarrior.com/" rel="nofollow">Sniper: Ghost Warrior</a> (though it's getting poor reviews).  Whatever the reason, it's a phase I go through from time to time, and I found myself looking through my copy of <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=17765&amp;it=1" rel="nofollow">The Wushu Guide to Gun-Fu</a> and reading Dan Bayn's thoughts on keeping a sniper involved in the action.  He writes: "By their very nature, snipers aren\u2019t usually in the thick of the action. They\u2019re more the 'crouch on a rooftop a quarter mile away and pop people\u2019s heads off without suffering any retaliation' type. The down side is that it\u2019s easy to get left out of a scene that way."<br/><br/>This reminds me of another character type, most often seen in cyberpunk games: the hacker.  Basically they're both specialized archetypes that usually do their thing independently of everybody else.  Anyone who's played a c-punk game knows of at least one instance where the entire game ground to a halt while the hacker did his or her magic with a deck.  The eternal question was always how to integrate full-party participation with what amounts largely to solo play.<br/><br/>Bayn's advice for integrating snipers isn't really to integrate them at all.  His solution is to put some direct threat on the sniper that he or she must deal with, but this is also independent action.  It'd be like a hacker hitting a particularly nasty bit of black IC; people are still standing around waiting.  I wonder if it's possible to put the sniper/hacker <i>into</i> the <i>party's</i> action as a participant while still doing that thing they do, as opposed to pulling everybody <i>out</i> of their action.  Is that making any sense?<br/><br/>An example I can think of is dramatized above: the sniper provides realtime assistance to a squad of other players penetrating an enemy encampment.  I'm sure there's some kind of hacker equivalent that someone can come up with.  The issue is reconciling a character type very different from other character types in the same frame.  Are we better off just saying, "No snipers!" or is it realistic to expect that the sniper/hacker characters can be integrated into the party's action on a regular basis?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283702/#Comment_283702" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T11:21:50+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 11:21AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mh. i've played no games of c-punk (had the manual lying on my shelf for something like 6 years now, never found a group. sad.), and no games with snipers either, but i think they are really cool and should not be left outside narration. Maybe putting the "loner  specialist" and the rest of the group in the very same scene, while fully acting out both the "special cool ability" (be it sniping or hacking) and the rest of the party's playing style is not totally possible, but, also, this does not mean they must act in separate scenes. What about making the two different fronts interdependent? a very simplistic example:<br/><br/>The other PCs must infiltrate an enemy base or compound: at first, the sniper is providing cover (he can/must see possible threats the other guys are not aware of and deal with them), and they must cooperate, but then they have to take care of him, somehow: maybe an enemy turret spotted him and he's pinned in his position under heavy fire, and they must stop the threat, maybe they must lure out a target that he'll take care of. In all of this, communication may be possible, but somehow problematic: maybe, everytime they use radios there's a chance they'll be intercepted and spotted, so they really have to cut it down to the minimal.<br/><br/>Doing this with a hacker might prove more difficult, but it may be possible...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283703/#Comment_283703" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T11:23:18+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 11:23AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to assume you're talking about a game with an emphasis on tactical combat whether it's something crunchy like GURPS or less so like FATE. I'm also assuming you group consists of a GM and 4-6 players.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll talk about snipers first. You really shouldn't have snipers in the game. Scout snipers operate in two man teams and are usually far away from the main force. There isn't much opportunity to interact with the rest of the players here. If someone wants to play a sniper like character they should really play something like a designated sharpshooter. While the bulk of the fire team engages in fire and maneuver tactics, half team lays down cover fire while the other moves to get a better position  then switching roles, the sharpshooter engages specific high threat targets with careful aimed shots.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow hackers, I've never been fond of any sort of hacking minigame. I would just handle any hacking with a single skill test. With this model the hacker is like the thief in a party. They pick locks and stuff, but that's just part of what they do in the group. If you have robots, maybe they launch viral attacks against their AI instead of backstabbing in combat. Otherwise the hacker is back at the office and not really part of the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my two cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283706/#Comment_283706" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T11:27:44+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 11:27AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Somebody told me the television show Leverage, which I have not seen, routes around this dilemma by making all the characters constantly in communication via some high tech A/V earbug thing.

Now, if you wanted to highlight the sniper's role in the scene, here are three ideas:<br>\n<br>\n1. The meet goes south quickly and the other PCs are in trouble.  Give the sniper character a map and show him where the hostiles are.  No one else can see the map, so he has to direct the other players through scenes telling them where/when to go and occasionally picking off people when fights occur.  You could take this a step further and tell the sniper the situation, and simply let him GM the scene as he is the outside observer/narrator.<br>\n<br>\n2. If you don't have earbuds, the sniper can only see things that happen.  If you really want to make him feel included for a special scene, have the players describe their actions only.  Any dialogue occurs via written notes.  This way, the sniper can see what is going on, but may not know if/when/who to shoot except what he infers from what he can see.  This could lead to some interesting accidents, pantomiming from other players as they try to direct fire, and escapes by villians as the sniper hesitates.<br>\n<br>\n3. Finally, if you ever have a player unable to attend the session, suggest that he be designated the sharpshooter for the scene.  At a crucial point in play, call that player on his cell, describe what he sees, and ask him if he takes the shot.  The kicker, then ask him if he made the kill!  You'll have your other PC's hanging on the sniper's decision and the absent player will still feel involved (though he won't know the fallout of his decision until later).<br/>\n<br/>\n[edit] 4. I could also see banning PC snipers, but including one as an NPC with a dedicated minigame for the players.  The decision tree for a sniper comes down to two big questions, Does the sniper take the shot? and Does the sniper hit or miss?  You could tell players that they have sniper support at the beginning of the session and have them each write "shoot" or "no shoot" on a sheet of paper and "hit" or "miss" on another.  Put the folded sheets in two piles and then throw away all but one sheet from each pile.  Hold the two remaining sheets in reserve until a critical point in the story.  At the critical junction, open the sheets and describe what happens.  This way, they all [albeit collectively] play the sniper but no one is left out of the action.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283726/#Comment_283726" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T12:26:20+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 12:26PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.phreeow.net/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=Play+February+11+2010" rel="nofollow">Snipers and hackers are featuring highly in Hollowpoint playtesting</a>.

Most of what you're doing in cyberpunk-esque games is some kind of heist, infiltration whatnot which the Leverage show has covered since they're all criminals. Also, check out movies along those lines like Ocean's 11 where you have multiple people in play in different places working together. Ghost in the Shell has people speaking to each other via mindlink all the time so they can go all covert-ops. In a high tech world, everyone is always in communication. Or think about like, hackers on the go, like in the updated cyberpunk 203x or like John Conner in Terminator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283750/#Comment_283750" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T14:51:39+00:00" title="July 30, 2010  2:51PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, the first thing that comes to mind for me is that where hackers and snipers (going here with a loose definition of 'guy who shoots from far away with awesome-kick-ass accuracy, rather than the more accurate 'scout sniper' military designation used above) interact with the rest of their guys is in the effects of their actions. Okay, big dumb obvious point, but let me break down a bit (it kind of builds on the 'like a thief' bit above).<br/><br/>So, you've got a hacker. The rest of the party doesn't really care about the crazy hacking mini-game he's playing. One way to handle that is to not have any more of a mini-game than any other series of rolls for any other in-game actions. Or keep the mini-game in, but break it into discrete chunks with effects that everybody does care about. Maybe your hacker has to get the drone guns turned off, or the security doors opened, or provide the cameras with false video feeds. The rest of the group cares about that stuff (in a tactical sense, at least), and as long as it's broken up like any other action sharing, shouldn't be a big issue.<br/><br/>Snipers can do likewise - there's some threat to everyone that the sniper can better counter from his position, or he warns them of the incoming bad guys, or what not. Just don't build the whole mission around the one special skills guy, or everybody else will feel like a supporting character <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Oh, and the earbuds/walkie talkie thing is great, of course, for the non-tactical concerns of involvement and such like.<br/><br/>A perfect media example of their interaction: the scene in Firefly where Mal is like "That's a mighty fine hat you got there" and Jane, listening on his earbud, snipes hat guy right in the face. He was listening in to the whole scene, and his sniper support made it viable for Mal and Zoe to confront the potentially thieving old-lady in the first place, and then he played an active role in the fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283752/#Comment_283752" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T15:03:49+00:00" title="July 30, 2010  3:03PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A perfect media example of their interaction: the scene in Firefly where Mal is like "That's a mighty fine hat you got there" and Jane, listening on his earbud, snipes hat guy right in the face.

(Jarate is not affiliated with actual karate.)<br/><br/>Jarate is an area effect - you huck the jar at the enemies and the enemies caught in its splash (ahem) suffer mini-crits for the next few seconds.  This means your teammates are boosted, given immediate and direct assistance by you.  (You can only, er, "produce" Jarate every minute or so.)<br/><br/>Essentially Jarate is a reason for Snipers to move up with their team. By giving bonuses to staying closer to the team, the game gets snipers involved in the front line fighting of the game (but because it's a grenade-like item, you still stay somewhat back.)  Jarate also extinguishes characters who are set on fire and shorts out a spy's invisibility device, which are two things that not all characters have easy ways of dealing with.<br/><br/>The equivalent might be in FATE, using a Sniper as a spotter, making declarations as they use perceptive abilities and items in order to help set up situations advantageous not only to themselves but to the rest of the team.  Essentially the Sniper would become a sort of mini-counter-GM, indicating, "The horse they rode up on is Very Tired, I can see that through my horse-o-scope." or whatever and rolling to see how many Declarations they can get.  Then when things go pear-shaped, everyone gets all kind of bonuses for what the Sniper did.<br/><br/>"Professionals have standards."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283769/#Comment_283769" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T19:54:26+00:00" title="July 30, 2010  7:54PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe the 4th edition of Shadowrun changed hackers quite a bit from previous versions, and even from the Cyberpunk standard. They made it so that everything is wireless in their world -- everyone's computer is basically a wifi-transmitter and receiver together, and you operate a computer through an augmented reality interface. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically what the wireless access thing meant for the story is, instead of needing to hack in from a far away computer, making your way through the wired network step by step, now you could tag along with the group as they infiltrate the evil corporation's headquarters or whatever, and then access the Local Access Network directly via wireless connection once you got inside, just run a quick program to hack the password and you have direct access.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the augmented reality interface meant that your character wouldn't have to sit and look at his computer screen while all the other player characters did more interesting and tangible things all around you. Your character would see everything happening in the computer world as a kind of overlay laid on top of his regular vision, and could dodge bullets, run for cover, and maybe even shoot something, all in between efforts to disable the security robots &amp; cameras, unlock doors, and whatnot. I'm not sure if the setting provided this, but if I were running a Shadowrun-like game, I'd make it so that the augmented reality was like a hologram from Star Wars, which everyone could see floating above the hacker's computer, so that it would become one more tangible thing in the environment that sort of belonged to everyone. The hacker wouldn't necessarily have to report what he sees, everyone could see it for themselves, and they'd know what he's doing without him having to explain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for snipers, as long as you're in a science fiction setting like Cyberpunk or Shadowrun, you could possibly use remote drones to engage the sniper in the action too. In Shadowrun I think they had a "rigger" character who could control these drones, and he would be the one you'd have do the sniping too. Instead of just chatting on the earbud-communicator thing and waiting for his chance to shoot, he could first use his remote robot drone thingy (I imagine one of those floating robot ball-shaped seekers like you see in Star Wars, on Tatooine) to scan the area, maybe shoot some badguys, hopefully not get blown up in the process. He could also remote control his car to make sure it was at the right spots for drop-off and getaway. Or maybe the hacker could break the security codes on the internal robot security systems and hand them off to the rigger, who could control them too, while the hacker hacks into something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nSci-fi provides lots of options. I'd really like to try running this sort of Shadowrun-inspired setting... only without the Shadowrun rules. Maybe something like Apocalypse World instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283773/#Comment_283773" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T23:53:51+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 11:53PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really think that <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> solves this problem.

They use snipers and hackers in combination, and Saito (the team sniper) has to take both roles in Solid State Society. How it works in those shows is very different from what I've encountered in rpgs like Shadowrun and Cyberpunk in terms of both encounter area and detection.<br/><br/>The encounter isn't a room, but an area. It's big enough that close combat specialists often have to move around to keep up with the battle while the sniper engages the entire area (except what's behind cover). Each smaller sub-area (e.g.rooms) are dealt with in less detail to allow the larger encounter area. The rest of the team may have to draw targets to the sniper, or at least spot the targets to call for support. Because of this, the sniper has to get into position, which can occur either before or during the encounter, as well as conceal, protect or change position as needed.<br/><br/>GitS also assumes that combatants don't have a good sense of where each other are at the start of the battle (and can lose track during the fight, too) or precisely who they are facing. Hackers can play a role in finding opponents during a fight, but often only in combination with clues picked out by those present. Hackers are also part of tactical assessment, giving information on enemies that can alter plans as the battle progresses.<br/><br/>There's a few things that have to change in rpgs for this to work. Shooting must be innaccurate. An elite sniper may hit almost every shot, but even an elite soldier is doing mostly suppressive fire, hitting only when enemies are caught in the open. Speaking of that, situational modifiers have to be magnified. It should be very hard to hit somebody behind cover, and the quicker a firer needs to react and pull the trigger in a situation, the worse the accuracy is. Snipers hit, not just because they're good, but because they're not immediately threatened and so can take the time to aim.<br/><br/>The hacking element is a little more hooked to the game setting. The old metaphor of a dungeon crawl is probably the worst way to go about it for a team effort, because it's long and involved, with a big reward at the end. What you need is something that's quick and gives little rewards as needed, more like intelligence gathering/websurfing than hacking/attacking the enemy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284343/#Comment_284343" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-04T17:31:11+00:00" title="August  4, 2010  5:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think perhaps <i>Leverage</i> has another lesson to teach us - we're asking the wrong question.  The question should not be <i>how can we incorporate a sniper/hacker into what is happening with the rest of the group</i> but, instead, we should be asking <b>how can we incorporate the rest of the group with what is happening with the sniper/hacker</b>?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the TV show <i>Leverage</i>, all the characters have a specialization but scenes are set up to highlight one player's specialization with other characters supporting that type of action.  Perhaps other players have to provide suppressive fire to lure a target into the open while the sniper lines up a long shot.  Perhaps other players have to pose as legit users to distract an SysAdmin long enough for the hacker to DL files.  A lot of the fun in <i>Leverage</i> comes from watching the others try to help in roles they know nothing about - the fighter trying to play wingman to the con artist.  The hacker trying to walk the thief through disarming a security system, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286439/#Comment_286439" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T11:24:44+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 11:24AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great!
