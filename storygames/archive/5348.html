This isn\u2019t an original theory, of course.  Keith Johnstone expressed this in <i>Impro</i>, and we\u2019ve kicked this theory around here as well.  So, last night, it was with mixed apprehension and excitement that I approached my playtest of my newest game, <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/category/games/roleplaying-games/flowers-for-mara-development-and-playtest/" rel="nofollow">A Flower for Mara</a></i>.  We were maxing out the player count at eight people.  Five of them were new.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn\u2019t until yesterday that I started feeling nervous.  I was grappling with three fears:<br/>\n<br/>\n--What if they just don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d?  In other words, what if they failed to embrace this activity and therefore it fizzled?<br/>\n--What if they mentally lock up at improvising and creating things on the fly?<br/>\n--What if they don\u2019t grasp their ability to make up stuff about other characters?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be fair, those in the group who hadn\u2019t roleplayed before did have theatrical experience of some kind before, be it formal or informal, so I was hopeful.  But still, the fear twittered around in my stomach, making me nervous.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was totally wrong on all counts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was an awesome group, and I\u2019d happily play this or another game with them again.  Yeah, it was that good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, let\u2019s get into the report!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Dramatis Personae</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAll the players were people from my church.  I put out an open call for playtesters on the church email list, and this batch is the result of this email.  I have another family who also expressed an interest, so I\u2019ll be able to do this again.  Fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth\u2014I was the Director for the game, which generally makes me the all-powerful GM.<br/>\nGabrielle\u2014My sister.  She played Mara, the deceased woman, who now is just a memory.<br/>\nRaquel\u2014A friend.  She played Joshua, Mara\u2019s father, with a detached relationship with Mara.<br/>\nJohn C.\u2014Whitney\u2019s husband.  He played Caleb, Mara\u2019s husband, with a detached relationship with Mara.<br/>\nWhitney\u2014John C.\u2019s wife.  She played Ruth, Mara\u2019s sister, with a competitive relationship with Mara.<br/>\nJana\u2014Married, but not to any of the other players, and John C.\u2019s sister.  She played Zoe, Mara\u2019s daughter, with a devoted relationship with Mara.<br/>\nJennifer\u2014John B.\u2019s mother.  She played Naomi, Mara\u2019s mother, with a bitter relationship with Mara.<br/>\nJohn B.\u2014Jen\u2019s son.  He played Thomas, Mara\u2019s brother, with a bitter relationship with Mara<br/>\n<br/>\nThe major addition from the last playtest was the relationship types, which Jason Morningstar helped me hash out in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25500.0" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>.  The way it works is that, before you are assigned your character, you choose a relationship type from the following list:<br/>\n<br/>\n--devoted<br/>\n--competitive<br/>\n--respectful<br/>\n--bitter<br/>\n--subordinate<br/>\n--detached<br/>\n<br/>\nThe neat thing about this is that, because you\u2019re choosing before you know your character, you\u2019re actually choosing what sort of story you\u2019d like to play through.  Taken together with the relationship map, you very quickly produce an interesting starting situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Overview of Play</b><br/>\n<br/>\nHere\u2019s a basic overview of play.  Mara died in the spring.  So, after the special opening scene at the funeral dinner, the game goes through the four seasons, with each player having the opportunity to have a spotlight scene.  Then, once all these scenes are done, there\u2019s a group holiday scene.  After winter, the game is over.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe meal scenes are really interesting, because you get to see all the characters interacting together, plus each character gives an internal monologue about his current emotional state.  It\u2019s lots of fun to see the contrast between someone\u2019s external appearance and their internal thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, whenever it\u2019s your scene or your monologue, Mara can come talk to you.  Mara is played by one of the cast; however, she\u2019s not a ghost.  Rather, she\u2019s a reflection of your memories of Mara.  Only you can hear her when she\u2019s talking to you.  (Although, since all the players can actually hear Mara\u2019s player talking, you can achieve some nifty effects.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way that you can stop Mara from talking to you is by putting down your flower.  See, at the beginning of the game, everyone is given a flower.  Yes, including the Director.  Then you have to write down some experience that caused you grief or sorrow on a piece of paper and attach it to the flower.  To lay it down, you go to the graveside and tell the entire group about your grief.  Then you lay the flower down and walk away.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you do this, you give up any further spotlight scenes.  However, Mara can\u2019t bother you anymore.  The idea is that your character has turned the first corner on accepting the loss of Mara.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one is required to give up his flower.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120229/#Comment_120229" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T17:58:21+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  5:58PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What Happened in Play</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWe started off with a brief pep talk by me about not being afraid to create and all that stuff.  Then I gave my version of the Lines and Veils talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief aside:  my opinion on Lines and Veils is that you don\u2019t usually know where your need for a Line or Veil is until you actually get there.  So, rather than trying to hash it out in advance, I make clear the need for the group to accept someone \u201ctapping out\u201d on a given topic without there being any stigma.  From where I sit, it actually gives permission for people to push further into difficult topics, trusting that the other players will pipe up if someone is going too far.  I\u2019d be curious to hear from my fellow players about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we prepped characters, learned the rules, and generally prepared to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>A Flower for Mara</i> always starts with the entire group gathering around the designated graveside while the opening music is played.  This time, I opened with \u201cOn the Evening Train\u201d by Johnny Cash (from the album <i>American V</i>).  Then we got underway.<br/>\n<br/>\nWow.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thoroughly impressed with the quality of play.  People quickly introduced all sorts of complications into the story.  Some highlights:<br/>\n<br/>\n--At the funeral dinner, Thomas started talking about dividing up the family heirlooms that Mara owned.  This included the house where Caleb still lived.<br/>\n<br/>\n--There was a fight at Easter dinner, because Naomi ordered out for pizza instead of making the traditional Easter dinner that Mara always made.  Zoe lost her temper, yelled at everyone, and stormed out.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Zoe\u2019s husband was currently deployed, and she was pregnant, so she ended up giving birth on Mara\u2019s birthday.  So she\u2019s lying in the hospital bed, sobbing because her mother wasn\u2019t there for the birth.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Thomas got drunk to celebrate his great-niece\u2019s birth and then showed up at the hospital.<br/>\n<br/>\n--It came out during play that Mara had actually stolen the boyfriend of her sister Ruth.  Yep, Caleb originally was going out with Ruth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prompted very little of this.  Indeed, the \u201cexperienced\u201d roleplayers of the group were not the center of the story at all.  The \u201cnoobs\u201d took to the game like they were old hands and roared into action.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was amazingly cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recorded the entire session and videotaped most of it.  At some point, I may release bits onto the Net for demonstration purposes.  However, I promised that I would not release the recordings of the various flower monologues, where the players spoke of their griefs.  That would be too personal.  So, if you weren\u2019t there, you just don\u2019t get to know.  But, after each monologue, there was this sense of bonding and embracing.  One player actually gave another player a hug in the wake of his monologue.  We all shared something special because of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was also amazingly cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, we gathered at the graveside for the close of the game.  I played \u201cWhen Sorrows Encompass Me\u2019 Round\u201d by Cordelia\u2019s Dad (from the album <i> Cordelia\u2019s Dad</i>).  Then we were done.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs people were leaving, John C. told me that roleplaying had gone up in his opinion, and that he\u2019d really like to play again.<br/>\n<br/>\nJana\u2019s husband, Joshua, asked  tongue-in-cheek who had won.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won.  Oh yes.  I won.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120230/#Comment_120230" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T17:58:32+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  5:58PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What Was Awesome</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI don\u2019t usually use exuberant language in my writing about roleplaying, but I\u2019m still buzzing over this success, so I hope that you\u2019ll allow me some enthusiasm.  So, yeah, this is the section about the stuff that was awesome about Wednesday\u2019s playtest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Roleplaying is easy!</i><br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, this group demonstrated that a lot of these \u201cadvanced\u201d techniques that we discuss are actually fairly normal.  In particular, I found that the cast took very quickly to the concept of \u201cendowing\u201d traits.  This is when one character says something to another character like, \u201cAt least I\u2019m not a drunk like you.\u201d  Thus, the character has now been \u201cendowed\u201d with the trait of being a drunk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a key technique in <i>A Flower for Mara</i>, and I was afraid that this would be too difficult a concept.  I was completely wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that my favorite example of endowing was during a conversation between Ruth and Mara.  Ruth\u2019s relationship with Mara was \u201ccompetitive\u201d, and they were both reflecting on this.  Gabrielle (as Mara) says, \u201cYeah, I guess I did always have to have the better boyfriend, didn\u2019t I?\u201d  Then Whitney (as Ruth) says, \u201cBut you still married Caleb, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was so subtle I missed it at first.  In fact, Gabrielle missed it, too; she was half-way into her next line when she realized the import of what Ruth had said.  Mara had stolen Ruth\u2019s boyfriend and married him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example was during Easter dinner, when Jennifer (as Naomi) commented about how the takeout pizza was a major improvement over a complicated meal.  I looked at the table and blinked.  I had been seeing ham and all that.  Now I suddenly saw pizza boxes instead of fine china.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find that a good endowment makes my understanding of the scene suddenly turn sideways.  This happened several times, and I was very happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn interesting note on the Director\u2019s role.  <i>A Flower for Mara</i> has a strong GM position.  Pretty much, his word is law, and whatever he says, goes.  I find it funny that I\u2019ve spent the last nine years of my roleplaying life trying to escape a strong GM role, and then I design it straight into one of my games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, properly structured, the Director\u2019s role can actually help encourage roleplaying.  In both playtests, the cast has reported that it is freeing to have an all-powerful Director standing by.  If the Director doesn\u2019t like something, he can always overrule it.  Therefore, you\u2019re actually free to experiment.  If it doesn\u2019t work out, then the safety net of the Director will catch you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Griefs are good</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ve figured that the flower monologue about your grief is probably the scariest thing about this game.  But, honestly, last night changed my opinion about this.  I got the sense that the cast <i>wanted</i> to say these things to each other, that the game created a space where we had permission to talk to each other in this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was interesting, actually, hearing several people preface their grief with a statement like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t nearly as big a deal as everyone else\u2019s, but\u2026\u201d  Then they would go on to say something that was honest and heartfelt and obviously near to the heart.  The \u201csmallest\u201d thing that was said wasn\u2019t really that small at all, because it wasn\u2019t small to the person who said it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Relationship types are really handy</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIn contemplating the game design, my biggest concern was that the cast wouldn\u2019t have enough to get the game started.  Putting the relationship type together did the trick.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the cast agreed that the relationship type helped them to quickly get a good picture of who their character was.  We actually got up to speed in forty minutes, including teaching the rules.  That\u2019s uber-fast, in my book.  Also, John B. noted that it adds an element of randomness to character creation.  You\u2019re blindly matching a relationship type to a character, which means that the game won\u2019t work out quite the same way each time.  Also, in the end, this \u201crandomness\u201d shaped a fairly believable family.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, Gabrielle reported that playing Mara was fairly easy, because the relationship types gave her something to work with.  Now she could say, \u201cHmm.  I have a competitive relationship with this person.\u201d  Then she would use that to guide her interactions with the character.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I found it gratifying to see that people tended to choose relationship types that matched the tone of their griefs.  This wasn\u2019t universal by any means, but several players said, \u201cI chose such-and-such relationship type because of this experience.\u201d  Without too much encouragement, they all played close to home.  Very nice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>On being detached</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to make sure that the \u201cdetached\u201d relationship type was exercised, so I asked Raquel to take it.  John C. also took \u201cdetached\u201d, so it actually got a double workout.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concern that both Jason Morningstar and I shared is that \u201cdetached\u201d could be an easy way to hide.  \u201cI\u2019m not involved; therefore, these events don\u2019t touch me.\u201d  However, I think that this isn\u2019t a problem, because the character is embedded in a relationship map with the rest of the characters.  No character can escape; by definition, they are all tied together.  So, in this context, being \u201cdetached\u201d is still a means of interaction with other characters.  Now, if <i>everyone</i> were detached, that could potentially be a problem.  But, even having two of the six characters be detached worked out pretty well.  If nothing else, it makes you an excellent source of conflict for others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Pizza</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the Easter dinner scene, several of us were saying, \u201cMmm\u2026pizza.\u201d  So Jennifer ordered some and had it delivered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAwesome!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What Needs Tweaking</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m really happy with where the game is.  The one thing that I noticed is that people who laid down their flowers early (say, in the summer) were starting to run out of inspiration for their holiday monologues.  You feel like you\u2019ve resolved your story, but you\u2019re still having to talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, part of me is wondering if these monologues should be optional after you\u2019ve laid down your flower.  On the other hand, part of me is thinking that a \u201cpass\u201d would be as easy as getting up and saying, \u201cTurkey!  I love turkey!\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ll have to mull this over a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, a couple of the playtesters wished that they were allowed one additional scene after laying down their flower to be able to wrap something up.  At this point, I\u2019m thinking that this is better handled by trying to integrate your \u201cwrapping up\u201d into someone else\u2019s scene.  But, again, we\u2019ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>On Laughter in a Serious Game</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWe laughed a lot on Wednesday.  I mean, a lot.  To the point where Jana assured me, at the end of the game, that they were actually taking it seriously and hoping that I wasn\u2019t offended.  I wasn\u2019t offended at all.  Sometimes things are funny because they are true, and you laugh because you recognize it.  Sometimes you laugh, because something is a bitter truth and you have to express the pain somehow.  Better to laugh than to cry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Conclusion</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are certain roleplaying sessions that stand out in your mind.  Those times that you know that you\u2019ll remember for a long time to come.  Those times that you know that you bridged the gap of understanding with someone and, for a moment, your souls touched.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was one of those sessions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was honored to be a part of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120236/#Comment_120236" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T18:15:19+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:15PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, that's literally thrilling, Seth.

I'm all bubbly and stuff.  :-)\n<blockquote>Lines and veils is a tricky thing - also worth talking about (another thread maybe); I disagree with your approach.  Did it come into play at all Wednesday?</blockquote>\nHey, start the thread, and I'll show up!<br><br>As far as Wednesday, no one piped up and said anything.  I was also watching for discomfort levels, and there wasn't anything that I saw.\n<blockquote>The session was obviously special for you - did you get the feeling that others felt something profound happening as well?</blockquote>\nI think so, especially for Jennifer.  Their family is new to the church, and she saw participating in this as a way to come to understand each other better.  Indeed, she was really excited about the flower monologues for this reason.  ("Excited" might not be the right word, but will have to do.)  She said it was like when you would be at a slumber party with ten other girls and you'd share something personal with them, and it was this bonding moment.<br><br>So, yes, I'm not the only one.\n<blockquote>How did the dynamics of eight people work out?  My gut feeling is that more is better for Mara.</blockquote>\nThis is the second playtest of the game.  The first time had the minimum four participants (Caleb, Zoe, Mara, and the Director).  This had the maximum.  I'll be interested to try it out with a medium number of people.<br><br>The dynamics were great, once we got started.  I was nervous about managing such a large group, but I just jumped in and started teaching, and everything worked out fine.  It helped that we rearranged our living room, moving around the furniture to enable play.  That meant that there was a lot of space for me to pace while teaching the game.  That makes me feel better.<br><br>The first game felt more intimate, in part because it focused in on just a couple of people.  This larger game required that the cast needed to figure out who the story was "about", and therefore bow out if it wasn't them.  So we had three people lay down flowers in Summer (which is Act 2), because they knew that it was time that their characters step out of the way.  Without this...it could have been a long night.<br><br>That being said, having a larger number of players allowed Mara to flourish as a character in her own right.  Seeing Mara interact with two people was very different from seeing her interact with six.  It made her character fuller, I think.<br><br>Logistically, I created a sheet to help me keep track of which characters had taken scenes in which acts.  For two characters, this wasn't really necessary.  For the full complement, it was a life saver.  I'll be refining this a bit and including it with the final game, for sure.  I'll also put together a Mara sheet to record the various relationship types, so that the Mara player can have it for reference.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Murphy</cite>Another example was during Easter dinner, when Jennifer (as Naomi) commented about how the takeout pizza was a major improvement over a complicated meal. I looked at the table and blinked. I had been seeing ham and all that. Now I suddenly saw pizza boxes instead of fine china.</blockquote>\nThis was my favorite bit. Such a wealth of technique, creativity and chutzpah in one line.<br><br>Oh yeah.  And that was just the prelude to a great acting job by Jana, playing Zoe, who slammed her hand on the table, yelled at everyone at the table, and stormed off.<br><br>It was really that good.<br><br>I'm still flying high on this one!<br><br>Seth Ben-Ezra<br>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120411/#Comment_120411" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T11:44:15+00:00" title="January 18, 2008 11:44AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2008 11:44AM by Caesar_X.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great news, Seth!  I love sharing our passion with "non-gamers", but there's always a lot of "will they hate it?" anxiety involved for me.  When I introduced TPK to my young niece and nephew and actually watched them make decisions between "right" and "wrong" I was kind of blown away.  This can be powerful stuff.<br><br>A few things from your excellent AP report stood out to me:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite>However, properly structured, the Director\u2019s role can actually help encourage roleplaying.  In both playtests, the cast has reported that it is freeing to have an all-powerful Director standing by.  If the Director doesn\u2019t like something, he can always overrule it.  Therefore, you\u2019re actually free to experiment.  If it doesn\u2019t work out, then the safety net of the Director will catch you.</blockquote>\nI really like the way you put this, Seth.  I love GM-less games to death, but especially with players who are not used to the process of role-playing, a "kind but firm" hand can really let you take chances.  It reminds me of my improv teacher.  He said little during our classes except to encourage, but when we strayed he always made sure we knew we could do better.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite>Second, Gabrielle reported that playing Mara was fairly easy, because the relationship types gave her something to work with.  Now she could say, \u201cHmm.  I have a competitive relationship with this person.\u201d  Then she would use that to guide her interactions with the character.</blockquote>\nAnother really nice piece of data.  This feels like a good piece of board game design where you have "several interesting things" to choose from.  Again, it's a creative constraint that doesn't feel like a constraint.<br><br>I also like your comparisons between running the game with small vs. large groups of people.  Keep the APs coming!!<br><br>Chris                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
