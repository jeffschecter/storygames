Not because I don't think it'll work well, but because I was hoping for something very different. I bought it based largely on knowing that it was coming from someone from a pretty different tradition of game design, or at least someone who hasn't been publishing too much lately. I thought that might mean it'd show some different approaches to things or new and different ideas. Instead it strikingly parallels Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>Seriously: there's player and GM turns, traits, advancement through use, fists full of d6s, journey rules that tie to seasons. I don't even think that's intentional, I think that they just developed in parallel. <br/><br/>I'm still pretty psyched to play (I'm not running it yet, I have two games starting in the coming weeks). I just wish that it wasn't so close to something I already know (and love).<br/><br/>Oh, and to contradict Adam (one of my favorite passtimes): the art is pretty dope indeed but the text is mangled in layout. Lines get crunched together or spaced out to ridiculous lengths. Someone needed to add letter space and glyph scaling to their justification settings. That isn't even just an artsy critique, there are lines were it's not clear where one word ends and the next begins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340219/#Comment_340219" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-23T14:48:06+00:00" title="August 23, 2011  2:48PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Sage">@Sage</a>: yay!

Deal damage equal to your weapon's Damage stat.<br/>Did you hit with a Great Success? Deal additional damage equal to your personal Damage stat.<br/>Did your Feat die roll equal to or above your weapon's Edge stat? Your opponent has to make a Protection roll with his Armor dice.<br/>Did that Protection roll fail to exceed your weapon's Injury stat? He's Wounded (or, more likely, dead).<br/><br/>That's the kind of thing that feels very boardgamey to me. It feels like, "We're playing a game, right? So there'll be lots of dice rolling?" <br/><br/>You're never rolling that <i>many</i> dice -- one 12-sided Feat die and as many as three or four d6s on average (for the characters in the book, anyway) -- but resolving a single attack can feel like it involves a bit too <i>many</i> such rolls.<br/><br/>Anyway. I want to give it another chance sometime, when I can.

Although in the wrong hands, it can apparently turn the game into Wandering Monster: The RPG, as a couple friends of mine discovered at GenCon (in another GM's game, natch). I don't really have a problem with a game that assumes the GM won't be a dick, but if you're not able to self-select your GM, as my friends found out the hard way, you might end up with a GM who makes you hate the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340295/#Comment_340295" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T05:57:51+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  5:57AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played this last week and had a ball.

That is actually quite a lot less dice rolling than most RPGs out there, which tend to average at 2 with either attack + damage or opposed attack + defence.<br/><br/>I am not sure its actually as "dice roll" centric in play as the impression you may have got.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340399/#Comment_340399" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-24T19:57:36+00:00" title="August 24, 2011  7:57PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the parallels to Mouse Guard are fair, but I don't think its fair to call it a Tolkien MG hack. I actually think TOR shares more similarities with Pendragon and Prince Valiant. The later is an RPG which even Mouse Guard draws from heavily in terms of its structure. <br/><br/>The biggest difference between TOR and MG is that TOR is a more hands off, like those earlier RPGs. There are many times it leaves matters open to GM discretion and takes a more traditional approach to how the system is used. The resources and in game economy aren't anywhere nearly as tightly wound to the gameplay as MG. For example, though there is a Fellowship Phase in TOR and it is suggested that this be player driven, it is much less embedded than the Player Turn in MG.

I haven't finished the Loremaster's book yet, maybe there's some more specific advice there, but I either want very clear guidelines (a la Mouse Guard and Burning Wheel) or a system that lets me not make up difficulty numbers (Apocalypse World).</blockquote>\nI hear you. FWIW here's a workable hack I use to acheive this to some extent. <br/><br/>1. Set the TN to 14 unless the book says otherwise.<br/>2. If the PC has an clear advantage in the situation allow them to add their Attribute as if they had spent a Hope.<br/><br/>Given TOR has a high TN baseline, this addition of free Hope allows you to give a modifer if an action is somehow easier but wave away determining the actual extent of the advantage. There is rarely any reason to push the TN harder. The Attribute system nicely determines what PCs should be good at in a variety of situations, meaning you get a sense of the character but its not "gameable".<br/><br/>To give an example, I ran Marsh Bell the PCs made a Song roll to see if they recalled the poem "The Mewlips". The TN was 14, given a 10 to 40% chance for most. However, one PC was a Hobbit and the poem is a Hobbit poem. So he applied his Attribute for free being a +4, effectively reducing the TN to 10. This increased his chance from 40% to 75%.<br/><br/>If you feel the Attributes are too strong, you could try just the Favoured Attribute bonus part, but that seems more effort than its worth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340418/#Comment_340418" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T04:56:39+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  4:56AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very curious about the Journey and Skill Challenge like rules.

'Encounters' is a mechanic for interaction with major NPCs, like when they go to Beorn's House or talk to the Elven King in the Hobbit. The NPC has a Tolerance based on things like cultural connections to the NPC, and if you fail more rolls than the Tolerance the discussion with them is over. This to me is pretty similar to the three failures of a Skill Challenge.<br/><br/>But here's the funny part. I played 4e for a long time and tried a number of ways to get Skill Challenges to work with my group and they always felt artificial. If you spruiked me to but a game with Skill Challenges as a mechanic I'd laugh and keep walking. But the first (and so far only) Encounter I ran in TOR clicked and felt natural. I think this is partially due to a better set of skills, partially due to a better dice mechanic with degrees of success, partially to a variable number of failures making it more interesting and partially to the strength of the connection to the fictional background (the characters were talking to R the Brown and held him in reverence).<br/><br/>I'll leave it for someone else to explain Journeys.<br/><br/>TOR feels like a cross between Mouse Guard and my original Red Box Set (with a little Warhammer 3e thrown it). The limits it puts on characters (cultural heritage, no Mages, downplaying classes, etc), the rules mechanics and the art and design tie it strongly to the fictional world of Tolkien. It is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but to me it is an instant classic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340430/#Comment_340430" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T07:12:38+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  7:12AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yet another game that apparently is available in stores but Amazon says isn't out yet...fuckers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cangelucci" title="cangelucci"><img alt="cangelucci" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cangelucci">cangelucci</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340432/#Comment_340432" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T07:52:09+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  7:52AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @Valamir - If you absolutely need it now, a PDF is available at DriveThruRPG.com.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340458/#Comment_340458" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T11:08:20+00:00" title="August 25, 2011 11:08AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread increased my interest in the game, so I went over to drive thru to see how much the pdf was going for.

As they stand the rules are very loose and not much like Skill Challenges in implementation. Its more a set of extended skill use guidelines. For example, there is discussion about which skills to use if choosing a spokesman (Awe) or going as a group (Courtesy). The one exception to that is the setting of a Tolerance level which is the number of failures that will effectively end the Encounter. <br/><br/>I found the Tolerance Rating to be a little weak. I love the greater flexibility in Encounters compared to Skill Challenges or MG's Duel of Wits, but without some context as to what success mean or a defined number of rolls, the Tolerance Rating is best used only as a guide.<br/><br/>I added a slight overlay to Encounters which listed 5 Boons that the PCs could get from an Encounter. This clicks pretty well in giving all rolls some meaning (both success and fail) and also allowing complex Encounters to be notated simply with impinging on the overall flexibility:<br/><br/>To give some examples:<br/><br/>The Beorn encounter in the Hobbit:<br/><br/><b>Queer Lodgings</b><br/><b>Tolerance:</b> Valour + Standing (Woodsmen) - 1 (prejudice against Dwarves)<br/><b>Introduction TNs:</b> Awe 14, Courtesy 16, Riddle 12<br/><b>Boons:</b> (PCs are not allowed to stay at Beorn\u2019s house)<br/>1. A prolonged rest<br/>2. Treat Wounds<br/>3. A 2nd prolonged rest<br/>4. Advise on road through Mirkwood (treat as being familiar with the path during Journey)<br/>5. Ponies to the edge of Mirkwood <br/><br/>The Wood Elf encounter in the Hobbit:<br/><br/><b>Halls of the Elven King</b><br/><b>Tolerance: </b>Wisdom + Standing (Elves) - 1 (prejudice against Dwarves)<br/><b>Introduction TNs: </b>Awe 16, Courtesy 12, Riddle 14<br/><b>Boons: </b>(PCs are thrown into seperate dungeon cells)<br/>1. Allowed to make prolonged rests<br/>2. Placed in the same dungeon cell as other PCs<br/>3. No Guards place on dungeon cell<br/>4.

Can someone describe how they work?</blockquote>\nThen to Journeys. Journeys are the second most significant mechanical system in the game next to combat. In essence, it involves plotting a course on a map and then making a number of rolls to determine the effects of travel and "hazards" encounters.<br/><br/>In more detail:<br/><br/>1. Players have a players map which is essentially an in game map. They ploy their course.<br/>2. The GM then uses the GM's map which has hexes. It also indiciates the nature of the terrain and how "tainted" it is.<br/>3. Using this map, the GM determines how long the journey will take, how many Travel rolls are required and the TN for those rolls.<br/>4. The PCs can make a variety of rolls before setting off to get benefits on the journey - shortcuts, being familiar with the trail etc.<br/>5. The PCs can take on one of four rolls - Guide, Hunter, Lookout or Scout<br/>6. The PCs all the first Travel Rolls. A failure means that the PC suffers an increase in Fatigue.  A critical failure indicates a Hazard.<br/>7. Hazards can be rolled randomly or determined by the GM. In general, one of the 4 rolls has a chance to avoid the Hazard i.e. the lookout could spot the approaching orcs, the Guide could avoid the bad camping place.<br/>8. You can't full recover from the impact of the joureny until you have rested at a safe location. Arriving somewhere exhausted can be a disadvantage to PCs.<br/><br/>At its base, that's it. However, as has been identified, along with Fellowship phase, the Journey system can itself be the source of adventures using a Mouse Guard/storygame approach. TOR's rules create a good framework for running a campaign on the fly, utilising a large amount of player input.  <br/><br/>Looking at the Hobbit:<br/><br/>1. Players choose how the Fellowship is formed and their objective. In this case, they are a group of Dwarves returning to the Lonely Mountain to regain their treasure and ancestral home from a Dragon.<br/>2. GM embellishes the opening details, adds Gandalf as an NPC who brings the map and key to the mix.<br/>3. First Journey Phase. The players get a Hazard and the GM decides its a Troll. The scene plays out and the GM awards Treasure.<br/>4. First Fellowship Phase. Arriving at Rivendell, the players decide that they need to be tougher after being beaten by Trolls. A few spend their XP on Valour and add magic swords as Rewards. The GM embellishes this by making them Elvish blades (makes sense given they are in Rivendell) and say they glow when Orcs are about. The GM adds the reading of the map by Elrond.<br/>5. Second Journey Phase. The players get a couple of Hazards. The first is the bad weather. The second is another monster. The GM chooses orcs, given that the PCs have Elvish orc killing blades. The scene plays out as written. The GM gives one PC a magic ring to stir things up. The PCs get a third Hazard. The GM already has inspiration from the PCs being chased by orcs, so throws in the Wargs.<br/>6. Second Fellowship Phase. Players plan their journey and decide on going through Mirkwood. The PCs use their Standing to narrate the impact of the previous scene, saying that they killed the Great Goblin. GM embellishes with a comment about an enchanted stream.<br/>7. Third Journey Phase. Through Mirkwood. Hazards are the enchanted stream, then an Encounter with the Elves. The Encounter with the Elves could be quickly notated using the system that I proposed in another thread. Then its just a question of riffing off the players who come up with a way to escape whilst holding of agreeing to give up a share of treasure. Final Hazard sees the PCs take a battering due to Bilbo's poor judgement.<br/>8. Third Fellowship Phase. The PCs make Esgaroth a Sanctuary and resupply. GM adds two new NPCs - Bard and Master of Lake Town.<br/>and so on<br/><br/>The climax of the Hobbit (Battle of the Five Armies) is really just a culmination of the PCs actions and inputs throughout the game. <br/><br/>Strangely, this actually reflects pretty much how Tolkien wrote the Hobbit with only brief ideas for each section which he expanded by building up on the story as it went along.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340493/#Comment_340493" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T14:45:48+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  2:45PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to complete the trifecta of major subsystems in The One Ring, here is a combat summary that I posted elsewhere. Overall its quite flexible and open, relying on narration by GM and players and no physical tools. Though simple, it still has a few choices that do have a significant impact on the outcome. So you are not just rolling dice for attacks. For example, it is a common experience for PCs in their first combat to charge forward in Forward Stance, only to subsequently scatter to a variety of different Stances more appropriate to the PC and situation  <br/><br/>The full version of combat (including stuff in the Adventurer's Book and Loremaster's Book) is:<br/><br/>1. At the onset of combat, there is rules for surprise and being surprised. Each PC makes a roll as appropriate. Extra successes allow PCs to warn or assist other PCs.<br/>2. Each PC can roll their Battle Skill to gain a number of extra dice that they can use or gift anytime during the combat to represent tactical advantages and beneficial terrain use. The TN for the roll depends on the situation i.e. TN12 if you surprise your enemy, TN14 if you are defending, TN18 if you are attacking, not at all if you are surprised.<br/>3. Most combats start with an opening volley of ranged weapons, though this will depend on the situation.<br/>4. Each combat round alternates between sides. The one to go first depends on the set up i.e. PCs would go second if surprised but first if they surprised their foes.<br/>5. Each PC chooses one of 4 stances - Forward, Open, Defensive (all 3 are melee), Rearward (ranged). A PC may only take Rearward if there are two PCs in melee and the PCs are not overwhelmed by numbers.<br/>6. Stance determines 3 things, all of which are on the Stance Cards I posted. First is Order of Action. Forward goes first, then Open etc. Second is the Parry Value of you and your opponent. Forward is Parry + 6, Open is Parry + 9. So, if you go all out, its easier to hit your enemy but its easier to be hit. Third is the non-attack actions available. There is one for each Stance and include intimidation, rallying, aiming and protecting another PC, and Escape Combat for everyone. <br/>7. Engagement. The side with the most combatants pairs PCs and NPCs on a one to one basis and then can double up or use ranged with extras.<br/>8. Attacks rolls are like any other Skill. You do damage to Endurance for a hit based on Weapon and extra damage based on your Body Attribute for each extra success. A target can choose to halve damage by choosing to be knocked back and essentially loosing their next action. If you hit 0 Endurance you are unconscious (dying if you have a Wound).<br/>9. If you roll high on your Feat Dice, you can also score a Wound. The target's armour gives a chance to resist the Wound. One Wound doesn't do much other than hinder healing (and grant Shadow Points for any PC that has you as a Fellowship Focus - "I'll save you, Mr Frodo!" ). However, if you are Wounded a second time, you are unconscious. Also, if you are Wounded a second time and taken below 0 Endurance, you die.<br/>10. You can take a Called Shot. Each Weapon has a different Called Shot effect, such as automaticaly threaten a Wound for a bow, disarm for a Sword or shield smash with an axe. To make a Called Shot you must success and get an extra success or nothing happens. If you roll an Eye, you critically fumble, essentially loosing your next turn.<br/>11. Monsters do Called Shots when a PC rolls an Eye.<br/>12. Monsters are a little simpler to operate than PCs. They automatically add their Attribute (they have 1 rather than 3) to any favoured skills. They go down with a Wound (though creatures of great size still need two). They have Hate points to fuel special effects, which are generally easier to use than PC Virtues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340495/#Comment_340495" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-25T14:48:31+00:00" title="August 25, 2011  2:48PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks so much Luke.

One player was German. She speaks English really well.  But the terms used in One Ring tripped her up a bit.  Traits like "Elusive"... had her asking what words meant.   Which is cool.  Rpg books have a proud history of expanding readers' vocabulary.   However, there are many terms used-- with scant distinctions between them:  "Fatigue" and "Weary" are two different stats.  "Explore" and "Travel" are two different traits.  Easy for that to blur in to a mindmush.    I would have been happy with fewer, more distinct choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I chose a Houndsman of the Mirkwood, because he gets a dog.  It's cool that the dog is not described as an offensive weapon. (Fuck Michael Vick.) More like armor: Fido can jump in and nobly take damage on your behalf.   Having a dog also increases your Hope.  If played in a boardgame/CCG mode, the dog is like a card you play when you need it.  If played more freeformy style, you'd improvise more uses for the dog, but always roll for success based on your Hound-lore. Rather than treating the dog as a fully statted-out being.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. My friend Chris had never played a tabletop rpg, but he's 80th level on WoW.  He said "they really thought this through" during character creation.   He was referring to how exactingly the Tolkien source material was represented.   But he also said "I didn't expect it to be so linear", referring to the provided one-shot quest.   I felt he got an iconic intro to a classic mode of tabletop play, for better and for worse: the drudgery that can result when combat is no more colorful than "I hit it with my axe, again"/ yet the creativity of "I'll try to awake the mesmerized character using, uh, my Song ability!"<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I think big license games face a dilemma: a majority of the buyers think they know what an rpg is/should be, and don't want their purchase to differ from that box too drastically.  And yet-- every new game is a wide-open opportunity for innovation.  One Ring strikes the balance by offering a state-of-the-art iteration of a trad model.  I'd have preferred if unusual, innovative elements were the core of the game, not bolted-on features to a trad chassis.  Example: there's a nod to a relationship mechanic, where each PC is assigned a buddy PC (so Sam gets a penalty if Frodo is harmed.)  But that's not the core mechanic of the game, by any stretch. <br/>\n<br/>\n5. To echo Wightbread's last post, Encumberence is well done. Going shopping? The 'price' of items is how much it sucks to lug them around. You don't feel it today... but you'll REALLY feel it tomorrow.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n6.. I think this would be a good game for people who don't like 4e, but do want something fresher than d20, without breaking the mold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340845/#Comment_340845" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T13:25:03+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  1:25PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: framweard</cite>Can we keep talking about this?<br/><br/>I like where they're going.

The Campaign Guide is due before Errantries of the King in August 2012. War of the Ring is due 2013. So, it looks like just 2 or 3 supplements between the core releases and the Campaign Guides may be the biggest one. I have not seen any further word on Rivendell, though it may make more sense as the default base like Laketown for Errantries of the King, though I would hope it would be Bree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340847/#Comment_340847" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T13:30:06+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  1:30PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is my report after running my first game:<br/><br/><i>I ran the Marsh Bell today with a group of 12 to 13 year olds and one 16 year old.<br/><br/>It went very well. I didn't explain the advancement system as it was a one off and we left some of the peripheral complexity unsaid as it didn't turn up. However, the simplicity of the system was well matched and they picked it up quickly. <br/><br/>The system did a good job of adding in good building blocks without the clutter. Having to choose a Fellowship Focus is the seed to thinking about the bonds of Fellowship, without being a burdensome relationship map. The Journey and Shadow systems gave the players a basis from which to role-play their PCs in a variety of circumstances in a manner that was effective compared to other RPGs I have run for them.<br/><br/>Combat was awesome. They loved it. It was filled with real choices, yet open to colourful narrative. It was damn exciting to boot. They had both a fight against a troll and a retreat from an uncountable horde of monsters.<br/><br/>The scenario is quite simple, but after hearing about the connection to the creepy Mewlips poem from Adventures of Tom Bombadil, it ended up being very creepy and flavourful. One of the funniest parts was a player expressing surprise at Song being a Skill, only for it to be probably the most used Skill in the game, including a the full Mewlips poem. The system definitely helps you get into that Tolkien narrative style.<br/><br/>Some great scenes:<br/><br/>- after the Elf PC insulting some Elves, another PC decided to subtly refer to an Elvish song recalling the long history of the Elves and then proceeded to hum it, hoping to smooth things over. He failed and looked to the players to agree to use a Fellowship point to let him succeed. One player agreed but the other three didn't. This transferred in game to the PC humming the tune and looking just plain awkward as the other PCs looked on in silent bewilderment <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>- a PC who was from Dale and rubbish in the wild took to entertaining the other PCs with jokes on the journey. One of the other PCs saw him as a rival. During the troll battle, the Dalish PC did little until the last minute where he frag whored the troll. This was after the PC who saw him as a rival went all out to attack and intimidate the troll (successfully) only to get knocked out of the combat at the final moment.<br/><br/>The rivalry deepened as a result and when the Dalish PC later gained a Shadow point he described it as his PC seeing himself of greater worth. Shortly after the PC found a fabulous jewel gained another Shadow point, and described it as coveting it. After all didn't he deserve it! <br/><br/>This whole development happened in a single session and was well developed for a 13 year old. It looks set to get very interesting in the future as the PC starts to loose himself in his own pride and his rival gets even more frustrated.<br/><br/>- the final battle to escape a horde of monsters was great. The combat handled the chase with high drama, as well as the earlier straight up fight, with ease. It was a sublime balance between simple mechanics yet meaningful choices.<br/><br/>When I said I was happy to run them another adventure in three weeks, I got a round of applause, which was a pretty good sign I think <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340862/#Comment_340862" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T15:10:15+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  3:10PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>I have a few impressions, thanks to Thor O. giving it a go, yesterday:<br/><br/>6..

But what if someone did? And if those gems passed the ill-fortune of Smaug onto their owners?<br/><br/>They played four of the pregens from the book: Mirkwood Elf, Beorning, Barding and Hobbit. I got them to make a single Travel roll for significant Fatigue increase to simulate the journey from Laketown so far and then started them in a clearing in Mirkwood, hotly pursued by and Orc warband. They used Lore and Explore rolls to determine possible places to face the Orcs, and chose the far side of a nearby log bridge. They put the two men at the end of the bridge to block it and had the other two Rearward with their bows. Twelve Orcs poured from the forest and even tried to sneak behind them via the rapids but, despite some tough moments, the heroes repelled and then hunted the last few Orcs through the forest. Some lessons: the funnelling of the bridge dropping the Orc numerical advantage dramatically had a huge impact on the combat; it is very hard to hit with a bow; and protecting your fellowship focus' back from a Defensive stance is an brilliant tactical move in terms of saving Hope.<br/><br/>They then travelled the last little way to Radagast the Brown's and gave him the sealed note and bag the merchant had given the character's in Laketown (according to the backstory) before they had set out on this ill-fated mission that had included many misfortune (sunken rafts, lost ponies, etc). Radagast was angry that the merchant had sent him a gem taken from Smaug's body to him to cure it's ill-luck, and he accused the merchant and the heroes of "dragon sickness" (greed). Eventually the heroes convinced Ragadast that they would destroy the gem to cleanse the ill-fortune and calmed him down. The Encounter rules worked well, but they reacted to the sucky setup, as I hadn't given them any choice in the mission.<br/><br/>The heroes travelled to a nearby deserted Woodman village to use the abandoned forge to melt the cursed gem, the only way to safely destroy it without spreading the curse. While stopping for lunch a Giant Eagle swooped down and almost took their new pony, but they talked it into scouting the abandoned village from the air instead. The eagle indicated caution by circling to the left, so they snuck in carefully. The found the tracks of a Stone Troll through the village and realized it was his hunting ground. They prepared the village as best they could, in case he came hunting tonight.<br/><br/>Of course the troll came that night, mumbling to itself along the path. The heroes were nervous and thought that perhaps they could trick the troll into going away or delaying until the sun came up. They all looked at the Hobbit, and he gave it a valiant go with Riddle which delayed the troll until they were ready but ultimately could not finish the ruse. The four heroes easily took down the troll in combat in the end due to some great rolls by them and terrible by the troll.<br/><br/>Ultimately they destroyed the gem in the forge, but not before it's Shadow touched the Elf, and headed off towards Laketown for a "discussion" with the merchant about the mission.<br/><br/>Overall we really enjoyed the mechanics and the Middle-Earth feel of the game, and now we all understand the rules we're looking forward to making up characters and playing a full game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340916/#Comment_340916" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-30T01:53:14+00:00" title="August 30, 2011  1:53AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Skywalker</cite>I would add in Prince Valiant and Pendragon too <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nI can see the obvious similarities to Pendragon, but never actually played it so didn't note this.<br/><br/>But I'd never even heard of Prince Valiant.

At GenCon, I had the luxury of just asking Francesco Nepetello in person "What do you <i>roll</i> for a Fatigue Check, though?" Then he flipped open the book and showed me -- a page away from where I'd been looking. It was under "Checks," but not the index's listing for "Fatigue Checks." While running the game (and learning it at the same time, basically), it was a little maddening.

In this case the GM will need both the PHB and the DMG as the PHB is not just a player's handbook. <br/><br/>The second is to repeat information, which increases page count inefficiently such as Dr Who.  <br/><br/>The third is to try and allocate the rules in a logical way. TOR is the later and I think it actually does the split better than most RPGs out there. The players have all the information they need on hand. They are not overloaded with matters that the GM needs to consider which are left soley to the GM in the GM book.<br/><br/>I can see how people may have different preferences for the split, but I still think atrocious is an exaggeration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341314/#Comment_341314" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-01T19:04:16+00:00" title="September  1, 2011  7:04PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2011 7:05PM by Denys.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Skywalker</cite><cite>Posted By: Thor O</cite><br/><br/>I can see how people may have different preferences for the split, but I still think atrocious is an exaggeration.</blockquote>\nBut it's his opinion, he's not stating objective fact, it's okay that he thinks that.<br/><br/>Skywalker, you don't have to get on everybody when they disagree with you about the game.

And I did have a sharp pang of irritation when in the section on how to read the dice the "t" symbol on the d6s was mentioned but not explained.  I flipped back and forth and reread those pages several times before I gave up.  A few pages later I found the rule in the degrees of success section.  And when I thought about how I'd teach players what all the symbols on the dice meant...it hit me that there was no convenient summary.  Part of what a Sauron Eye does is in this paragraph, part of what a Sauron Eye does is in a completely different section.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not at all surprised by how atrociously organized the rules are actually.  War of the Rings is one of my all time favorite board games...it is pure unadulterated genius and I love it.  But the rule book...the rule book is a nightmare to try and figure out.  The game is no where NEAR as complicated to play as the rule book was to interpret.  Since its the same designer...it unfortunately makes sense that the RPG suffers from the same haphazard organization.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no doubt that all the rules are in there and that ultimately the system is just as tight and well designed as the board game.

So whilst I agree with you on there being an issue we differ on it's extent.<br/><br/>FWIW I have found that TOR improves quickly from that initial confusion, thanks to a relatively simply system with only really three core subsystems - Combat, Journeying and Encounters (if you can call that a subsystem).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341507/#Comment_341507" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-03T12:36:20+00:00" title="September  3, 2011 12:36PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran through the Marsh Bell today.

I had to flip about a few times, but most times the rules I needed were found in about thirty seconds. If there was a real problem I'd have a player look it up in one book and I'd look it up in the other.<br/><br/>I think the books are poorly organized, yeah. But I still don't find it to be atrocious. It's about as well organized as Pathfinder, or D&amp;D 4e (where you have six hundred books with shit scattered throughout them). I wish they had sectioned off the player/GM information divide better. Travel rules don't need to exist in two places, and combat should all be in the adventurer's book, for example.<br/><br/>All in all, I think it's a rad product and I can't wait to see what else they do with the line. I enjoyed reading the books immensely, and the organizational issues that cropped up in play (and they did crop up) weren't game breaking.

You essentially wind up writing your own trilogy each game, especially if you play at a casual pace so you can really enjoy the flavor of the cards and how the events they reflect fit together into a narrative (as opposed to just playing pure mechanics).  Its like there's a million parallel universes and each game is how the War of the Rings differed from one universe to another.  That's how solidly he understood and captured the essential elements of Middle Earth and the Fellowship.

The great gathering of culture serves as an excuse to bring the few rings of power that remain among the free peoples to Dale so that the White Council may use them to ascertain what brews withing the shadow of Mordor.<br/><br/>One of the ring-bearers, Avina the Silent of the Woodmen, did not arrive at the appointed date. As days passed and worries grew a council was held to decide a course of action. Bard himself asked his knights to dispatch one of their own and Bardulf Grimson was chosen. Aerandir of Mirkwood, brother to the elven ring-bearer Leriel, stepped forward at his sister's behest. And, since hobbits are known for stepping up to great challenges that do not suit them, Sancho Hamson of the Shire joined the journey.<br/><br/>Since the gathering of several rings within Dale will draw evil attention down on it, no one else can be spared from the defense of the city. The company will set out through Mirkwood to discover what became of Avina and the woodmen, and of the ring she carried.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>We're not Tolkien scholars so we're messing with the locations of the rings a bit to suit our story. The Mirkwood elves have one of the rings, perhaps carrying it on behalf of Elrond. The Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain have one as well. Dale also holds a dwarven ring long thought lost. The woodmen carry one of the human rings, somehow taken from a defeated Nazgul.

Goofy sounding at least.<br/><br/>Out of the Hobbit name list, 5 are already pretty strongly taken (Bilbo, Frodo, Samwise, Peregrin, Meriadoc) which seems ridiculous to me. It's actually one of the better lists in the game, really, and they still take time to remind you that, ya know what? Bilbo is a hobbit name. For a name list to really be useful, every name on it has to be usable. I want to pull it out during play, grab one, and keep going!

But it is just 5 out of 108 and the Hobbit male names is the worse of the bunch for this issue. However, I would think that usefulness is best determined by the number of non-replicated names not the number of replicated names.<br/><br/>Bardings, Beornings, and Woodman are all comparable in length to the Hobbit one. The Bardings is actually longer IIRC. The Elves is by far the shortest and the Dwarves sit in the middle.<br/><br/>As a matter of interest are you comparing TOR to the name lists in another RPG?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342001/#Comment_342001" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-08T17:49:20+00:00" title="September  8, 2011  5:49PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe its meant to be more an example of what names from a given group should sound like and less "pull a name and use it."

For Hobbits its:<br/><br/><i>"Hobbits names are composed by a first name and a family name. First names for boys are usually simple and short, with Hobbit girls being often given names of flowers or precious stones, but among the older families survives a custom of giving more heroic and highsounding names whose origin can be traced back to a time before the Shire. Names like Fredegar or Hildibrand betray a common root with similar names used by Men in the vales of the Great River. Family names seem to fall into three main categories: surnames without a traceable meaning (Baggins, Boffin, Took), \u2018descriptive\u2019 surnames (Hornblower, Proudfoot), and surnames hinting at a geographical feature (Burrows, Hayward)."</i><br/><br/>Not comprehensive admittedly but certainly more attention to names than most RPGs I am aware of.

If people don't like the ways things are going, they can stop posting or ask the OP to clarify what they want to talk about in their thread. I don't mean the prior statement to be combative; I don't mean to say, "if you don't like it, fuck off". I mean to say, if it's not your cup of tea, mention that and then evaluate your continued participation based on what people say. Or something.<br/><br/>I think the name lists are terrible too, but I own every book the man ever wrote and constantly troll the web for Tolkien stuff. I think the game is primarily made for people who already love Tolkien's work, but at the same time they could make the product more accessible. I do agree with John that the game often gives you a goal to work towards and then refuses to help you with that goal. For a modern RPG, that is less than ideal.<br/><br/>Then again, this is the first product in a line, so hopefully any discussion generated gets worked into future releases!

Overall there was some interesting bits. A few random thoughts:<br/><br/>Heroes are a bit more heroic than I expected. A attercap ambush was over before it had even begun.<br/><br/>Referencing the rules was slightly painful. The split between books is not always easy. For some reason a lot of the XP stuff, even how to award it, is in the player book.<br/><br/>Some monster abilities result in a lot of lockdown. We had our Barding knight spend most of combat ticking off rounds till he could attack again.<br/><br/><br/>And one big thought:<br/><br/>Journeys weren't what we were hoping for at all. We started the session with a journey. It started out great, the player map gave them reason to think about different routes, but not too much trouble. They decided on a course of action. Then things slowed down as I had to consult my map, do some math, do some more math. When I was finally ready, all my math resulted in was a number of rolls for the players to make. These rolls seemed totally divorced from the fiction. What's actually happening on the journey that these rolls tie to?<br/><br/>So we started making rolls, filling in the gaps by trying to make story descriptions of what success or failure meant. More rolls, more rolls. For anything interesting to happen the players have to fail rolls and an Eye of Sauron has to come up.<br/><br/>It seems like the Journey system ends up being a lot of GM math to figure out how many times the players have to roll to see if something exciting happens? That seems really counter-intuitive to me. A good bit of The Hobbit and LotR are about the interesting things that happen on journeys, but in the Journey system interesting things happen randomly, about 1/12 of the time?  <br/><br/>Are we missing something? In our game we did finally have an event on the Journey which nicely spiralled into filling the entire (short) session with a little work. I was just hoping for more interesting stuff to come of the journey system instead of some lost Endurance and the 1/12 chance for something possibly interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342985/#Comment_342985" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T17:41:25+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  5:41PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2011 1:19AM by Skywalker.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heroism is often a product of Hope expenditure. How much were they using? But yeah, TOR PCs can be quite awesome given how the stats for Monsters work <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Journeys can definitely turn out bland if it used purely to generate random encounters for the players to react to. I tended to find that they worked best when you combine them with other aspects of the game such as Fellowship Phase and cooperatively build up a story Mouse Guard style as I outlined above in post 26. Its not as sophisticated as Mouse Guard but it is also more flexible which can also be used to good effect. <br/><br/>As for their frequency, its 1/12th on any single roll. Though with 6 PCs rolling 3 to 4 times per journey, that's around 2 events per journey which seems about right.<br/><br/>I find that it helps a lot if the GM does some of the math up front. Essentially, you can work out hexes per day for each terrain type in advance, which helps reduce the time spent in calculation.<br/><br/>My post above is quote here for ease of reference:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Skywalker</cite>However, as has been identified, along with Fellowship phase, the Journey system can itself be the source of adventures using a Mouse Guard/storygame approach. TOR's rules create a good framework for running a campaign on the fly, utilising a large amount of player input.<br/><br/>Looking at the Hobbit:<br/><br/>1. Players choose how the Fellowship is formed and their objective. In this case, they are a group of Dwarves returning to the Lonely Mountain to regain their treasure and ancestral home from a Dragon.<br/>2. GM embellishes the opening details, adds Gandalf as an NPC who brings the map and key to the mix.<br/>3. First Journey Phase. The players get a Hazard and the GM decides its a Troll. The scene plays out and the GM awards Treasure.<br/>4. First Fellowship Phase. Arriving at Rivendell, the players decide that they need to be tougher after being beaten by Trolls. A few spend their XP on Valour and add magic swords as Rewards. The GM embellishes this by making them Elvish blades (makes sense given they are in Rivendell) and say they glow when Orcs are about. The GM adds the reading of the map by Elrond.<br/>5. Second Journey Phase. The players get a couple of Hazards. The first is the bad weather. The second is another monster. The GM chooses orcs, given that the PCs have Elvish orc killing blades. The scene plays out as written. The GM gives one PC a magic ring to stir things up. The PCs get a third Hazard. The GM already has inspiration from the PCs being chased by orcs, so throws in the Wargs.<br/>6. Second Fellowship Phase. Players plan their journey and decide on going through Mirkwood. The PCs use their Standing to narrate the impact of the previous scene, saying that they killed the Great Goblin. GM embellishes with a comment about an enchanted stream.<br/>7. Third Journey Phase. Through Mirkwood. Hazards are the enchanted stream, then an Encounter with the Elves. The Encounter with the Elves could be quickly notated using the system that I proposed in another thread. Then its just a question of riffing off the players who come up with a way to escape whilst holding of agreeing to give up a share of treasure. Final Hazard sees the PCs take a battering due to Bilbo's poor judgement.<br/>8. Third Fellowship Phase. The PCs make Esgaroth a Sanctuary and resupply. GM adds two new NPCs - Bard and Master of Lake Town.<br/>and so on<br/><br/>The climax of the Hobbit (Battle of the Five Armies) is really just a culmination of the PCs actions and inputs throughout the game.<br/><br/>Strangely, this actually reflects pretty much how Tolkien wrote the Hobbit with only brief ideas for each section which he expanded by building up on the story as it went along.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342999/#Comment_342999" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T19:32:40+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  7:32PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>So, last night we played our first session.

I'm thinking of turning it around and presenting Journey's as a series of semi-random challenges (eg: a swollen river to cross after rain) that you need to tsp into role related skills to overcome and that can tire (add fatigue) the party. And that failures will spiral to more challenges like Mouse Guard.<br/><br/>Its going to be a bit of effort, but I like every thing else so much and it will integrate well to the skills so I'm happy to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343012/#Comment_343012" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T21:17:36+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  9:17PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a lot of fun with the Journey system, and I took a lot of Luke's advice.

You gain fatigue if you fail your Travel roll, but then it says you recover fatigue when you have a night's rest. So, we would roll for a 4-day journey section, fail, get 2 fatigue, then instantly recover it overnight? Bizarre.<br/><br/>We ruled that fatigue gains pile up until the entire journey is over.<br/><br/>Also, the mechanical effect of traits was disappointing. They give you an insta-win (no roll needed) if you can "convince the GM" that they apply. This results in a weird dynamic. I don't want my trait to short-circuit a conflict (boring), but I do want them to matter (they're very flavorful and cool). Trait use also ties into the very hand-wavey XP system, so that just compounds the problem.<br/><br/>We're probably also house-ruling traits, doing something like +1D when a trait applies to your test.<br/><br/>(By the time we're done house-ruling everything, we'll probably have something that looks like a crappy version of Mouse Guard. I really wish the other players in our group were willing to just play MG in the first place.)<br/><br/>Was anything good about it? Hmmm. Hope and Shadow are pretty cool. The skill list is great. Watching the Hobbit negotiate with the Spider Queen was fun. The Encounter system and skills contributed to that, but the skill-challenge style "X success before Y failures" was fairly blah. I like the damage/wounds system. It's a bit random, but in a good way.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the game is mediocre. Not terrible, but not very good, either. Since there are roughly a million good RPGs on the market now, I can't really recommend it as a buy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker" title="Skywalker"><img alt="Skywalker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skywalker">Skywalker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343176/#Comment_343176" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-18T13:31:22+00:00" title="September 18, 2011  1:31PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2011 1:45PM by Skywalker.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fatigue is recovered only after a night's rest at a safe place at the journey's end. It isnt recovered sleeping on the road. So it accumulates through the journey and potentially beyond if the journey's end is Moria or some other hazardous location. So your house rule is pretty much the RAW. This is the one area in the rules did suffer the most from confusion and C7 was quick to clarify it. FWIW it is also connected to the one piece of substantive errata that has been made for TOR which is that Fatigue is recovered at the rate of 1 per night's rest.<br/><br/>In terms of Traits, there is a lot of GM fiat in them. But they do get some focus and detail in the book to guide the GM and players. So, their application is not totally left open. I can understand people's frustrations who want something more hardwired, but I have seen them used for good effect as presented.<br/><br/>I also agree that the Encounter system has issues as written. It has the X failures but no Y successes, giving the failures no context. I posited this patch for Encounters that is working quite well for me:\n<blockquote>1. Courtesy used for group introductions is treated like a prolonged action. If there are 3 PCs, the TN is reduced by 2. If there are 4 to 5 PCs, the TN is reduced by 4. If there are 6+ PCs the TN is reduced by 6. If 50% or more of the PCs succeed, it counts as 1 success. Each failure counts toward Tolerance and may restrict the PC from further involvement in the encounter.<br/><br/>This maintains the advantages and disadvantages of a Spokesman using Awe and Groups using Courtesy but ensures that high PC numbers don't tip Tolerance early. The logic is that larger groups can often cover each other and be more impressive, but still can also make more of an social gaff early on.<br/><br/>2. To each encounter add around 5 Boons. These are a default guideline of things that the PCs can gain from successful rolls in the encounter. Boons tend to get more valuable the higher they are. Some Boons may require 2 or 3 successes. The Boons can change depending on what the PCs pursue and any Skill can be used as appropriate.<br/><br/>Let's give some examples:<br/><br/><i><b>Appointment with Gloin (from the Marsh Bell)</b><br/><br/>Tolerance: Valour + 1 + Standing (Dwarf) - 1 (prejudice against Elf)<br/><br/>Introduction TNs: Awe 14, Courtesy 16, Riddle -<br/><br/>Boons: (PCs are not engaged by Gloin)<br/>1. Engaged to find Balin for Treasure 5<br/>2. Gift of boats<br/>3. Reveal Gloin's Foreboding (2 successes, gain +1 Tolerance)<br/>4. Increase Treasure by +1<br/>5. Remove Gloin's prejudice against Elves (3 successes) <br/><br/><b>Queer Lodgings (from the Hobbit)</b><br/><br/>Tolerance: Valour + Standing (Woodsmen) - 1 (prejudice against Dwarves)<br/><br/>Introduction TNs: Awe 14, Courtesy 16, Riddle 12<br/><br/>Boons: (PCs are not allowed to stay at Beorn\u2019s house)<br/>1. A prolonged rest<br/>2. Treat Wounds<br/>3. A 2nd prolonged rest<br/>4. Advise on road through Mirkwood (treat as being familiar with the path during Journey)<br/>5. Ponies to the edge of Mirkwood <br/><br/><b>Halls of the Elven King (from the Hobbit)</b><br/><br/>Tolerance: Wisdom + Standing (Elves) - 1 (prejudice against Dwarves)<br/><br/>Introduction TNs: Awe 16, Courtesy 12, Riddle 14<br/><br/>Boons: (PCs are thrown into seperate dungeon cells)<br/>1. Allowed to make prolonged rests<br/>2. Placed in the same dungeon cell as other PCs<br/>3. No Guards place on dungeon cell<br/>4. Freed with a promise of a share of the Dragon's hoard (2 successes)<br/>5. Freed without conditions (3 successes, must have obtained Boon 4)</i></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343178/#Comment_343178" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-18T13:46:00+00:00" title="September 18, 2011  1:46PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2011 1:49PM by Dave Hallett.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>(By the time we're done house-ruling everything, we'll probably have something that looks like a crappy version of Mouse Guard.

Despite similarities, I don't think its a direct inspiration. The One Ring IMO is much more like Prince Valiant (with much more GM discretion embedded in the system) which was also an inspiration for Mouse Guard IIRC.

Just extrapolating elements that already exist to fill a couple of holes.<br/><br/>Let's use Appointment with Gloin as the example. The Tolerance is say 3, being 1 + Valour of 2. There are no Dwarves or Elves with standing.<br/><br/>So the PCs arrive at the appointment and must first choose (in general terms) either to approach as a group or by spokesman. They choose the first. <br/><br/>Courtesy TN is normally set at 16, but the PCs will be making 3 rolls instead of 1. This increase in inherent difficulty can be compensated for using the existing prolonged action rules. The TN is reduced by 2 as there are 3 PCs to TN 14. Its still harder than Awe but not as hard as getting 3 Courtesy TN 16 rolls. <br/><br/>One PC fails and two succeed. The PCs come away from the introductions with the first Boon and 1 Fail. Essentially, Gloin is somewhat annoyed by having three people cluster around his desk but they bend him around to agreeing to engage them for the task as advertised.<br/><br/>The discussion continues.  PC One decides he wants more money. PC Two decides that he wants to know more of the task at hand. PC Three decides that he wants to know more about Gloin. PC One fails, causing Gloin to reprimand him and telling him of the importance of Balin and his mission (Fail is now at 2). PC Two succeeds and manages to divert the incident by focussing on the task at hand. Gloin informs the PCs about the Marshes and offers to provide them with Boats to speed them on their way. PC Three asks some probing questions and also fails. The GM decides that he narrates Gloin revealing that his cousin Oin is with Balin but a dark cloud appears over Gloin and he starts to ask if the PCs have any further questions (Fail 3).<br/><br/>The PCs all sense something unsaid and begin to use Riddle to tease out of Gloin what troubles him. The first roll succeeds and the PCs get a sense that Gloin senses his cousin is in horrible danger. However, the second roll fails triggering the end of the Encounter at Fail 4. Gloin calls the meeting to an end somewhat angered by the PCs insistence in finding out a sensitive matter.<br/><br/>The idea is to make sure that each roll counts, either succeed or fail, and for the GM to think in advance of some possibilities. It shouldn't be a set list and you can swap boons out for whatever the PCs seem to be pursuing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343345/#Comment_343345" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T00:41:49+00:00" title="September 20, 2011 12:41AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>(By the time we're done house-ruling everything, we'll probably have something that looks like a crappy version of Mouse Guard.

If you're looking for a game that will change the way you think about roleplaying, this is not it. It's got some good ideas, some interesting influences and a lovely attention to detail, including some great artwork. But it's not groundbreaking.<br/><br/>What I like about it is that the decisions about its design always seem to revolve around whether the result will truly evoke Middle Earth, rather than another of the many fantasy settings you refer to that merely borrow from it. (Why not just use D&amp;D, someone asked me. I was momentarily speechless, but I think the answer is pretty obvious, even though D&amp;D does indeed borrow heavily from Tolkein, which is what she was thinking at the time.).  I'm a settings junkie (Jorune, Tekumel, etc.), so TOR is right up my street. Whether it will deliver good play, I have yet to see, but I like what I've read so far. <br/><br/>And although I really appreciate all the great thinking and clever design that has gone into Mouse Guard, and in some ways I wish the TOR designers *had* read it, I also have to  admit that one of the things I like about TOR is that I think I can convince the more immersivist players in my group to give it a try. Whereas Mouse Guard, even a Mouse Guard hack, being a few degrees more 'metagamey' in their view, would be a very hard sell indeed. Given that this kind of player is going to be (IMO) a major part of their audience, maybe this is the right design for the game after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343408/#Comment_343408" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T13:42:10+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  1:42PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's weird, I found TOR much more metagamey than MG.

From my anecdotal evidence from observing the RPG Site, Dragonsfoot, Troll Lord Games and MERP sites, TOR seems to sneak its metagame ideas past more old school RPGers than Mouse Guard as those elements can be ignored to a large extent (or at least in terms of factoring them into your decision making as a player) and GM style and discretion still has a large part to play in how the game operates overall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343412/#Comment_343412" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-20T14:16:24+00:00" title="September 20, 2011  2:16PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Different tastes, I guess.

Old school RPGers and so called immersionists don't have an issue with dice rolling. In fact, many love it. Dice rolling is a part of the game not necessarily the metagame. <br/><br/>That group generally (yes, I am generalising) take issue with needing to make IC decisions based on OOC/narrative reasons. MG has much of this style of gameplay than TOR.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14964/the-one-ring/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14964/the-one-ring">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14964/the-one-ring/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/14964/the-one-ring/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F14964%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F14964%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
