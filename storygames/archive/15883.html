They have dice mechanics, sure, or card mechanics, or ritual phrases. But that's only part of the game.<br/><br/>We don't have much trouble adapting to games with unusual mechanics, because there is no "usual" for us. There is only "learn how to play this game and then play it." <br/><br/>My advice would be: read carefully, or ask specific questions to online forums (if the authors left out important bits &amp; you don't understand how to play), or, if you're still in the dark, get different "new games" to try. Some just aren't clearly written.<br/><br/>Edit: oh, and agree among your group that you're trying to play this "new game", not old games. Agree to point out if you've accidentally resorted to other game systems (even social systems.) <br/><br/>And my recommendations for "new games" that i have found clear (not knowing what "normal games" for you might be, but making assumptions) : Microscope, A Penny For My Thoughts, Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, My Daughter the Queen of France, Love in the time of Seid.<br/><br/>Games that i have had trouble learning from the book, regardless to how excellent they eventually may be in play: Shock: Social Science Fiction, Polaris, Mouse Guard, Sorcerer.<br/><br/>Also, i'd say that our cultures of game explanation (trad, indie, everywhere, all of us) are generally really poor. Hopefully we'll grow in that direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360616/#Comment_360616" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T17:12:33+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  5:12PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2012 5:19PM by stefoid.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If youre into huge amounts of new games then I suppose your group must have the habbit of taking games at face value, and also have enough experience of differing play styles to absorb a new game without much effort.<br/><br/>My groups are not like that!<br/><br/>I tried going from RuneQuest and CoC straight to Prime time Adventures.   That failed badly.<br/><br/>We tried In A Wicked Age , and Apocalypse World and Dungeon World, and that went better, but there came moments when we wanted to do something that was intuitvely easy to grasp fictionally, and therefore relatively easy to 'implement/reduce' in a straight task-based way, that just seemed to hit mechanical brick walls in those games.  I guess those things were so left of field from our perspective that we couldnt work them out.<br/><br/>So, from from that, I get that maybe you should start with games that have simple explicit rules, and dont stray too far from the groups expectations.  at first.  Maybe too much change at once is too hard to deal with for some groups (like mine) - they have limtied time and atention span for huge leaps of faith.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360617/#Comment_360617" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T17:16:14+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  5:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2012 5:16PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to speak for John, but it's my understanding that he is off the school that takes very seriously the 'immanence' of a games text. This means he plays the game by adhering to both the letter and the spirit of a games' text - so, if D&amp;D4e is about tactical fantasy combat he's going to play it that way, and not try to play it in the OSR fashion, or PvP, or whatever. <br/><br/>This school of thought holds that the rules matter, as written. And that if a game is to be critiqued, it must be done internal to the text itself, and not ideologically or intertextually. <br/><br/>So, I think when you write "The assumption of the document is that you have played a number of role-playing games and will most likely play this one in the same style as is your comfort," the major issues that comes up are:<br/><br/>1. Why design a game at all if all the rules are optional.<br/>2. How are you suppose to design a game's components if you don't actually know what the people playing are really doing.<br/><br/>So, you're trying to deliver a specific play experience with your rules. In order to that you need to say specifically what 'styles' and practices will best yield this experience so there is no mismatch between the rules and the game experience. <br/><br/>John's going to go to the trouble of playing the game exactly how you tell him to play it and have only the expectations of play that you give him. To him and others the service of telling them how, in an explicit and detailed way as possible.<br/><br/>[xposted with the two above]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360618/#Comment_360618" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T17:16:18+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  5:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, this is mostly dependent on how clearly the designer gives some impression of how he or she actually imagines the game will be played (as opposed to simply how it mechanically resolves). <br/><br/>If the designer provides a lot of guidelines (or suggestions) for play, we try to follow them. <br/><br/>If not, we play it like we would play D&amp;D--but not necessarily like <i>you</i> would play D&amp;D--with different resolution mechanics.<br/><br/>Just so you know, my group tends to have a LARP-ier interpretation of D&amp;D, with more emphasis on in character acting, than most I've seen, so I'm not saying we'd sit down break out the graph paper and minis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford" title="Fang Langford"><img alt="Fang Langford" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/042/nYHKMUMQV2HC4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford">Fang Langford</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360619/#Comment_360619" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T17:22:37+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  5:22PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2012 8:08PM by Fang Langford.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really interesting.<br/><br/>Let me clarify somewhat.  Every game has a point of specificity.  Short, one-shot games are written shorter and require more assumptions.  Let me employ hyperbole: each gaming group has its habit regarding rolling dice and what to do if one dice is lost or mis-rolled.  Some groups require all die rolls are made in clear view of everyone while some allow the gamemaster hidden rolls.<br/><br/>It's been my experience, when playing with strangers, that my group's habits have left me with expectations that differ.  Convention gaming has always been extremely instructive as to what habits differing game groups follow.<br/><br/>I may be complicating this discussion by leaving the level of specificity wide open.  I don't know how to express myself here.  I remember how hard it was for our OD&amp;D group to adapt to dice pools like given in the first edition of Shadowrun.  I've seen groups struggling with how dice pools should either have a flexible target number or use modifiers on each dice, but not both.  These are the kinds of habits I'm thinking of right this second.<br/><br/>I began this thread because I expect my mind to be blown!  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Fang<br/><br/>[edit] Cross-posted with the two preceding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360622/#Comment_360622" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T17:37:58+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  5:37PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "hidden GM rolls" thing can't just be group culture, because a lot of games have rules about that. First off, not every game has a GM. You can't have the GM hide rolls when he doesn't exist! Some other games explicitly say whether GM rolls should be hidden or not. And some games, though they don't explicitly say, don't really make sense one way or the other (I'm thinking of games where the GM has to follow certain rules for setting adversity, and hiding rolls would be counterproductive to that idea).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360625/#Comment_360625" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T18:05:58+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  6:05PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bounce between three diverse gaming groups and a lot of the barriers to a new game can be overcome during the pitch for that game.  Besides throwing out the color text, I always include an example of the main game mechanics in action.  That really helps to set expectations and seems to encourage solving problems with the tools that the game system provides.  I used that technique for Lacuna, Wushu, Ocean, Panty Explosion Perfect, 3:16, and The Trouble with Rose to good effect.<br/><br/>You may have seen a trend there.  All the rules systems are pretty light, almost to the point where you could put the player specific stuff on an index card or a single sheet a paper.  That really helps with the player buy in.  I don't know if the same pitch method would work for a meatier game where the players would probably have to invest in their own books.<br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/><br/>A bit of a tangent, but related...<br/><br/>Case in point, I've got a friend that wants to run Werewolf: the Apocalypse but hit a brick wall with the density of the rules as a newbie Story Teller.  The availability of the out of print rules is also an issue.  To help deal with that, I suggested writing up a conversion document from Werewolf to Wushu Open. It's a case where the 'old habits' of a generic system will help to facilitate playing a specific game setting if not the game system.  [If that works, I might have to try my hand at Wushu conversions of some other favorites such as Sprawlshu by David Miessler-Kubanek.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360642/#Comment_360642" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T20:20:17+00:00" title="February 19, 2012  8:20PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I left home for college, I've pretty much never played the same game or with the same group of people for more than one "natural arc" of a game (be that a single session or 3-6 sessions).  This is partially due to circumstances but partially due to personal choice.  After my last Apocalypse World game wrapped (which was long by my standards, like 10+ sessions), I explicitly told the other players, "That was cool, but I'm going to play something else with some other people now."<br/><br/>It kinda blows my mind that some people play the same games or with the same people all the time.  To me, games are like movies or TV series or something.  You watch one for a while, maybe, but there's so much other stuff out there and other people to play with.  Why in the world would you want to play the same thing all the time?  Sure, there's some games and people that I keep coming back to, but I crave variety.<br/><br/>Traditional convention play has mostly sucked or been mediocre in my experience, while meetup play with other indie games folks has been mostly awesome and sometimes mediocre.  I think most of it has to do with participants self-selecting into people who want to or are comfortable with playing a bunch of different games and adapting to the group of people they are playing with.<br/><br/>Sometimes you definitely encounter what Jason once jokingly called "story games brain damage," where different mechanics cross-pollinate in a weird way and people stumble across some issues trying to switch channels.  But I find that, most often, this happens when games or the people organizing a game are less explicit about the specific things and style of play a specific game requires.  If you assume that all games are more or less the same, people will bring their own expectations because they haven't been told to bring anything different.  But if you can be super explicit about the way (or range of ways) in which a game can be played, it's easier for people to at least be aware of the places in which they may or may not be altering their behavior to suit the needs of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360696/#Comment_360696" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T05:35:34+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  5:35AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2012 7:42AM by catty_big.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Must admit, I'm a bit puzzled as to why you think a group of players would play a new game in the same way as they would play their usual games.

Is that the sort of thing you mean, importing a high epic playing style into a lower level adventure game?<br/>Pretty much.  Or the assumptions about narrative are different.  Some games lean heavily on player input to determine what happens, why and when, while others are more strictly limited to the GM making those decisions.  If a player is used to having tons of freedom, they may chafe under the new restrictions or simply trip over them while trying to do something the spirit/rules of the game don't allow.  I know being bound to the tabletop-tactics of D&amp;D 4e would drive me absolutely nuts, as I prefer a more freewheeling interpretation of combat, and my trying to do the latter would be a disaster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford" title="Fang Langford"><img alt="Fang Langford" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/042/nYHKMUMQV2HC4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford">Fang Langford</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360758/#Comment_360758" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T09:25:17+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  9:25AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you guys are closing in on exactly where I was coming from, the Primetime Adventures example especially.

Relying on the toolbox that players already have often means succumbing to the lowest common denominator at the table, which means the game will work best if a group has already been playing together for a long time and has developed a bunch of sophisticated tools and shared expectations for collaborative play.  Otherwise, each of the players will be working from their own expectations and you're liable to have an unfocused experience full of clashing perspectives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford" title="Fang Langford"><img alt="Fang Langford" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/042/nYHKMUMQV2HC4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fang%20Langford">Fang Langford</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360837/#Comment_360837" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T12:36:39+00:00" title="February 20, 2012 12:36PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry.

Have you<i>never</i>intentionally or accidentally played a game wrong and had it work out better for you? Are you<i>sure</i>?<br/>Hold your horses. There's a difference between "PTA" and "a game". I'm pretty sure that PTA has a pretty definitive structure that works for it and if you abandon that structure, it's hit or miss. I guess it <i>can</i> be better, in some wild theoryland, but it's pretty much random. You definitely have better odds having a good game of PTA by following its procedures.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there certainly are games where if you don't bring in your own procedures to replace whatever the game implies then play is going to be more burdensome and less fun. Like 9 in 10 guys who run for Iron GM will admit to "cheating" to make the game work.<br/><br/>There's also a difference between houseruling/hacking (intentionally changing rules while understanding the consequences of doing so) and not following the rules just because.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360864/#Comment_360864" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T14:02:38+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  2:02PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2012 2:07PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>Relying on the toolbox that players already have often means succumbing to the lowest common denominator at the table, which means the game will work best if a group has already been playing together for a long time and has developed a bunch of sophisticated tools and shared expectations for collaborative play.</blockquote>\nI can't help but think that any long-term group that has developed a bunch of sophisticated tools and shared expectations for collaborative play is going to produce better and/or more fun and satisfying results for them than the vast majority of game designers would ever be able to.  It's the epitome of "Know Your Audience": that kind of gaming group absolutely does, whereas even the best game plucked off the shelf can only guess at it.  Fortunately(?) for game designers, they don't need to worry about how to address those long-term groups: they pretty much take care of themselves.  All a good game designer needs to learn is how to smile appreciatively and resist the urge to say "You're doing that wrong" when they hear what those people are doing with their beautiful game.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, for my part, I'm all for letting a new game tell me how to play it and trying to avoid dragging in habits from other games, right up until it either: A.) Does an especially shitty job of telling me how to play it (which goes double if there's something unusual/counterintuitive about how to best play it), or B.) directly and specifically contradicts something which I and the people I play with really want out of a game.  Those are dealbreakers, plain and simple...the first because we have enough games we could play instead that it simply isn't worth working that hard to figure out what's up with a poorly-explained new game, and the second because we only get to play for 3-4 hours a week and deserve to get the most out of that experience.<br/><br/>But if a new game is well-explained and it's offering up something we haven't tried before?  Bring it on, we'll make an honest effort to play it the "correct" way.  (Well, at least until we know enough about what this new game is offering to be able to decide whether the best practices of our years and years of playing together can be applied there to get better results.  We're not <i>animals</i>.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360888/#Comment_360888" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T15:09:41+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  3:09PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2012 3:11PM by catty_big.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Fang Langford</cite>p.s.
