The rest is listening, intuition, and resolve to create communally.<br/><br/>It occured to me that the Apocalypse World corollary for the first bullet point might be expressed as "Play to find out what happens." (refined in its principles as "Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.")<br/><br/>The corollary for the second bullet point might be "Make Apocalypse World seem real."<br/><br/>The third of these bullet points is directly Vincent's, obviously, perhaps the Golden Rule that encompasses the whole of the "Law of GM Technique."  Maybe its AW corollary could be expressed as "Make the players\u2019 characters\u2019 lives not boring."<br/><br/>Saying "No" is dull.  Making a Move following a 6 or less result using the tools Apocalypse World provides is seldom boring.  And the choices required by a 7-9 result are similarly "not boring."<br/><br/>All this to say I really appreciate Apocalypse World's agenda and that it speaks to my priorities for what good game sessions are made of.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke" title="NoahTheDuke"><img alt="NoahTheDuke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NoahTheDuke">NoahTheDuke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281205/#Comment_281205" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-16T21:50:08+00:00" title="July 16, 2010  9:50PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Roll the dice or say yes" isn't any part of AW.

(and a problem in many otherwise fine games is that they are not clear about the way to GM them, taking for granted that there is "only true  way to GM")<br/><br/>Vincent is trying with games like DitV and AW to distill these "way to GM" in concrete game procedures (and IMHO it's the way to go, to have rpgs become more "games you buy and play" and less "almost like a cult you have to join to be taught the secret techniques"), but these are DIFFERENT ways to GM. Don't mix and match.<br/><br/>(another very good game text for teaching "a way to GM" is Trollbabe II, for example)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281246/#Comment_281246" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T08:13:53+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  8:13AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like you've both addressed points I wasn't trying to make.
