Certainly with a 4-5 person group I never got to fully immolate everyone in the crucible of their Devil because I only ever played the game in 3-4 session bursts.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

The lack of a "normal" skill system relies a lot on the Dogs setup in which townsfolk come rushing up to tell everyone their problems, the town generation rules that have a very specific set of sins against the faith, and so on.  Actually the sin progression in town generation turns very problematic once you try to take it out of the premise of the game.

I wanted the exact same things you did, and DD as my second Forge game delivered in spades over several dozen sessions in 2003-2005. The game can easily end in 1-2 sessions, but that's only if your players do not understand the folding rules - love them and use them, and you'll find that the campaign takes about 4-8 sessions, depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>Dust Devils is also clearly superior to Dogs in the Vineyard for exactly the reason Ryan mentions: it encourages demographical play and social issues that are not religious and private in nature. You can't do spaghetti western without Marxist awareness. In this regard DitV is not really the ultimate western game people sometimes make it out to be.<br/><br/>Solar System does a fine western, but it's not going to have the gut-wrenching punch Dust Devils has - SS is going to be '50s heroic western, pretty much, or it's going to be Deadwood-long, with low lethality and slowly boiling issues. Dust Devils is the most lethal Forge game ever, pretty much; it's the only game where you go into that gunfight and you sweat bullets because the game is so f***ing unfair that it's really going to leave your character dead both in positioning (lying on the ground) and mechanically (zeroed in an attribute), all for one lousy gunfight you could've avoided. No mercy at all, no staying power and a brutal death spiral - lose one conflict, and you're going to be the kicking bag for everybody until you get better, if you do.<br/><br/>If I was crazy and didn't want Dust Devils, one of the top five Forge games ever, then I guess I'd do this in Primetime Adventures. Only with experienced players, though, as you'll need one of those if a PC bites the dust in the first episode and the player has to play his character in flashbacks and such for the rest of the season.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334433/#Comment_334433" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T05:43:29+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  5:43AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd suggest Dust Devils too, had you not already discounted it.

It has a reputation as a one-shot, which is understandable, as that's what it was needed for mostly when it was first published. Also, because the implications of the folding rules were often glossed over in practical play.<br/><br/>You resolve granular tasks as free narration in Dust Devils. For non-lethal conflicts you need to realize that the player responsible for the lethality is the one who is playing the cards: if you're not willing to go lethal on your opponent, then don't play a lethal hand. At our table it's not an uncommon play to see your cards and then try to talk your opponent into playing the "highest pair" rather than the best hand you can compile, all so as to limit the harm. The uncertainty about whether your opponent really will limit himself to a pair is part of the bluffing, and inside the fiction it's a rude surprise for your character when the opponent you thought was in it just for the laughs draws a knife. It's the game with the mostest when it comes to players having an ability to show restraint and chivalry in the face of a conflict system that couples your degree of violence directly to your ability to win a conflict; only the violent will win, or those willing to threaten violence. That's what "conflict" means in DD, there's no way to be Gandhi and use force at the same time.<br/><br/>For harmless conflicts you need to use the pre-conflict procedure: a harmless conflict is one where one player backs down in the face of imminent violence, either refusing to draw a hand or folding when they see their cards. It's still a conflict in rpg theory terms when a character gets his way because another player decides that going into a draw about it is not worthwhile for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334630/#Comment_334630" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T08:36:14+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  8:36AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's got a good summary of it, but I would add that the number of players at the table is really important too.

Absolute moral authority, right? I don't want that.</blockquote>\nMaybe this should go in another thread, I don't want to push Dogs here if you already excluded it...  but what you described isn't dogs in the vineyard!<br/><br/>The Dogs are not "Paladins". You are not playing God, saying to the player "God smile on you".  The dogs are, as explicitly is written in the rule book, young and naive well-meaning people that can do right or make mistakes. Their is only a matter of faith in a god that maybe doesn't even exist (and you as GM are forbidden to play God in any way or give any proof of his existence)<br/><br/>I am saying this not only to explain a set of mistaken assumption about dogs, but to express some doubt about the kind of game you want. What I wrote before is the way every "story now" game is played, in a way or the other: so I have some doubt about proposing other story now games like Dust Devis, PTA, etc.  It would be useful to know how much experience do you have with these games, and the kind of experience you are looking for (OK, you talked about the setting: but what the players - non the characters - should do in this setting?)<br/><br/>Returning to dogs: the underlying conflict that is the point of playing the game is the one between the individual and society.  One of the principal themes of western movies. Don't be blinded by the presence of a faith, it's not a game of paladins, it goes straight to the core of what a western really is.<br/><br/>Dust Devils is similar, but the conflict is between society and violence..
