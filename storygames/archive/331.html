                    Kuma's comments about West Wing got me thinking. I'm not ready to commit right now but does it seem like some tv and some games are moving in the same direction?<br/>
<br/>
After reading Primetime Adventures one can't help but start looking at tv to see if it follows the rules.  But then I realized that the shows I am enjoying are shows which follow the rules more than shows did say five years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Are we changing them or is there some sort of Zeitgeist that is moving all of us in some direction?                </div>

                            Well, if you accept the premise in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573223077/sr=8-1/qid=1141820156/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6900108-0802327?%5Fencoding=UTF8" rel="nofollow">this here book</a>, (which I do), then the answer is that TV is finally catching up with the potentiality of roleplaying games.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the author says that if you look at a show like <i>Dallas</i> from the 1970s, which was very complex for its day, and compare it to even what we would consider 'low-brow' entertainment, like <i>Friends</i> or <i>Buffy</i>, and you find that there's a whole lot more information that the viewer retains and manipulates in order to properly understand the show's contents.<br/><br/>His thesis, then, is that popular entertainment is actually a lot more complex than we give it credit for, and its getting more complex all the time.<br/><br/>So what that says to me is that pop culture is catching up with the complexity inherent in roleplaying games.  Even a game like <i>PTA</i> is quite complex (and it's a very simple game in relative RPG terms) - meaning that there's a coming convergence of the complexity of the overall culture and of the structure and form of roleplaying games.  RPGs were (and are) still ahead of the curve, but noticing more convergence between the two is natural.                        </div>

                            Thor, my wife and I watch SciFi Friday every Friday (or did, it's over this week), and I'm continually astounded at how both Stargate and Battlestar Galactica seem like they just use game transcripts instead of scripts.  Stargate uses some light system heavy on player power trips.  Battlestar Galactica uses Primetime Adventures.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I don't think we'll ever see RPGs like some shows like, say, the 70s Show or West Wing, where editing is a very prominent element of their production.                        </div>

                            Joshua, regarding the point about editing. I recently played a playtest for <i>Lucky Jones</i>, a sitcom roleplaying game being developed by Steven Hickey. <br/><br/>It includes editing-type control of each scene that aims (and seemed to work pretty well) at matching the kind of editing you see in That 70s Show. So I think it's possible, and maybe not too far off.                        </div>

                            Ok... this is how I remember it:<br/>
<br/>
It's GM-less, with roles rotating each scene. <br/>
<br/>
Each scene is framed by someone playing their character. You either set it up to work towards your goal this episode or to help out someone else.<br/>
<br/>
The person on their left has to keep things moving, which they do by asking questions like "what happened next?" "why did you do that?" and so on.<br/>
<br/>
The person on their right creates adversity. They do this by knocking on the table at the moment they choose for greatest tension and humour. Then they describe the worst possible conslusion to the scene and the main player describes the best possible conclusion. The main player then makes a roll to see which option happens. <br/>
<br/>
The other players all take the roles of their main character (if in the scene) or extras, as required.<br/>
<br/>
The use of the player-generating-adversity (Steve had names for each role, but I can't remember them) to stop the scene at any moment with a worst-case result made for great play. And it generated bizzare sitcom plots almost effortlessly. <br/>
<br/>
I'll point Steve at this to see if he has more to add. I'm sure I have missed some stuff that could well be of interest.                        </div>

                            The other reason shows seem to follow PTA is that a large chunk of the game text is a brilliant analysis of modern TV tropes. Matt essentially deconstructed the shows he likes and then said, "How can you get people to create this stuff on the fly, just by sitting around and talking?" Ding! There's your game.                        </div>

                            Oh, I meant editing as in retroactively changing what happened, trimming out dead weight and adding in stuff in "post-production."  RPGs are real-time in ways that television is very, very not, and this difference will mean that some things that teevee does we can't, and some things that we can do teevee can't.                        </div>

                            And yet in spite of all that, I still see more premise in todays shows than I did before.<br/>
<br/>
I agree about Battlestar Galactica being a wonderful show, but  I think that more than any show on today, it is the least like something you would get out of PTA . It has premice and it has characters and it has screen presence but,  and this is the thing that makes it one of the best it isn't a slave to any of that. <br/>
<br/>
As a seperate asside one of the things I learned about roleplaying from watching tv is that the characters growth doesn't have to be the story. On both X-files and Buffy the best stories were the ones where character growth was incidental to the thing the story was about. Otherwise it turns into soap opera.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>That reminds me, the other day Mo and I were fiddling around with ideas from her theatre days about things we could add to RPGs -- masks, method acting, dramaturges as underwriters, and so on. <br/><br/>One of the things Mo suggested was making a mechanic where you outline or breif-play out a scene multiple different ways and then use resolution to decide which of the possibilities actually enters play. Much like the way some stage plays will run the same scene different times durring practice to see which works, and then put the final in for the play the audience sees. Depending on how much you'd played out before resoultion you could then just note which became reality, or replay it, or play out the thing you'd only thumbnailed before. <br/><br/>After all, if actors get dress rehersals, why shouldn't we? <br/><br/>(Of course, we were also talking about this in the context of a game where the characters are competing insane voices, so the surreality of the same scene three different ways has a particular level of grounding there it might not in other games.)                        </div>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>Different mechanics (in the game we're developing anyway) -- but similar ideas. (Although something of the creational aspect is different, and the way Shadows handles things has more to do with multiple unreliable narrators than with dress rehersals.)<br/><br/>However, the idea (Mo's idea, not mine, btw) could be used in less surreal games. Dress rehersal scenes could be a pretty cool tool in a lot of boxes, I think.                        </div>

                            In FFRP, rolling back a scene that sucks is called a "retcon".  It happens a bit more often than most FFRPers would like to admit.<br/>
<br/>
"Wow, that scene came out terrible.  What do you say we retcon it, and next time, Mary is the one who decides to eat the banana instead of Susan?"<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can do that in RPG's too... but I rarely see it.                        </div>

                            I'd like to see it in action, Brand.  I must admit I'm skeptical of the players' ability to excise the non-canonical scene from their experience of the game.  To me it seems like the players would continually be thinking of what might have happened (instead of what might happen).                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Could be. Would depend a lot on setup, I think.<br/><br/>Of course, my experience of play with a certain type of player indicates that they already do that, so it isn't so much making a new problem.                        </div>

<i>Of course, you can do that in RPG's too... but I rarely see it.</i><br/>I think it happens all the time in RPG's, but it's so small-scale no one thinks much of it.<br/><br/>I'm gonna agree with the assement that PTA successfully selects a particular subset of television programming, identifies why these shows are compelling, and makes a game out of it.<br/><br/>EDIT: I am officially not a fan of the software.                        </div>
