I'm intrigued on the reasons for that, since they work great to push the game's goals IMO:<br/><br/>1) Relationship based reward. Most Apocalypse World hacks suggest players create goals, implicitly. Sagas makes it a explicit mechanic tied to your character advancement.<br/><br/>2) Bonds. You act on your relationships, you gain bonds.. that you use to influence other players characters, usually to advance your agenda regarding those initial relationships (protect my daughter, avenge my father, kill that christian neighbour, etc).<br/><br/>3) Gender/Social moves that work like a powder keg, guaranteeing that, sooner or later, characters will explode against each other. <br/><br/>4) Endgame moves that allow players to rewrite/retrofit basic moves based on changes in the fiction. Eg: "<i>When you die a christian, choose an aspect of local culture to change. This includes rewritting basic moves if needed</i>" - this allow a player whose character dies a christian to say, for example, that from now on the local culture will abandon the "upholding honor" basic move that's intrinsic to men.<br/><br/>This is one of the most interesting ecology of rules feeding into each other I've seen in a AW hack (even more than Monsterhearts *raises shield*). And it seems some people agree with me, as the review above indicates. Then, I ask, WHY has this not been replicated in any other AW hack or sibling? Perhaps the game wasn't popular enough to influence future hacks ? It's perceived flaws made people forget it's qualities? Other?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469969/#Comment_469969" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-13T01:43:34+00:00" title="February 13, 2018  1:43AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also very curious about Sagas, but I haven't been able to convince anyone to play it with me yet.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469976/#Comment_469976" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-13T10:18:35+00:00" title="February 13, 2018 10:18AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> Because it is hard to do really well.  Look at what you've said "ecology of rules feeding into each other".  You have to understand the genre and setting for the game you are trying to create really, really well (or get incredibly lucky out of the gate), and you also have to balance your "ecology" perfectly or one "species" of rule will over-run the system; so you also have to understand system really, really well.  \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>-<br/>You have to read, deeply analyze, and play a lot of games, in the design space your working in\u2014and in related design spaces\u2014before you can even recognize and breakdown these technologies and see which will best achieve your design goals. These technologies, probably adjusted somewhat to fit your exact goals, will be your starting point, from which you ask yourself \u201cwhat if\u201d questions in order to get closer to the best way to fulfill your design goals for the game.

I'm not trying to be a jerk or shut down discussion, but you've named two of best PbtA hacks in contemporary indie game design.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure what you're hoping for here.  Is this a call to arms, ie. we should be doing this?

But even outside the moves structure we have things like agendas tied to advancement (in the form of Relationships you must act upon to get xp), and the rewrite of basic moves depending on the group advanced choices.
