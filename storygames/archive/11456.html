I love the board game Axis and Allies, but every time I play it I want there to be more story to it.  Some ideas started percolating in my head, and I wanted to get them down, maybe get some feedback, maybe get some validation that the crack is not being smoked.  <br/><br/>Ideally it can be played GM-less; if there are two players, each plays one side; if there are more than two, players get countries (or maybe one gets neutrals).  <br/><br/>First, there are two overall spheres: for lack of better names, the Allies and the Axis.  There are also Neutrals, nonplayer with no particular allegiance to either sphere (but which may have internal factions of their own).  <br/><br/>Nations have various arenas in which they hold power: \n<ul>\n<li> Political.  This represents a country's political will to choose a sphere.  Each country has factions, usually two or three (pro-Allies, pro-Axis, pro-Neutral).  <br/></li><li> Diplomatic.  This represents a country's ability to negotiate with other countries to affect their politics.  <br/></li><li> Economic.  This represents a country's international trade and shipping, and control of overseas sources of scarce materials used in war (such as oil, silk, and rubber).  <br/></li><li> Military.  This represents a country's military might.  Military is measured only in resources (maybe not).  <br/></li><li> Industrial.  This represents a country's production capacity, and is measured only in "hit points" (maybe not).  Industrial base turns economic resources into military resources.  A certain amount of industrial capacity is required to be spent to maintain the country's standard of living, otherwise everything suffers (poorer quality military equipment, less food for the civilians causing erosion of political will to continue to fight, etc.)<br/></li></ul>\nEach is measured in two scores: resources, to be spent, and hit points (base? power?), which represent damage (some arenas only have one or the other and are linked in some way, i.e. the "military/industrial complex"...).  <br/><br/>Each country has multiple factions.  Factions vary in their loyalty to or desire to join one side or another, and political resources must be used to maintain the factions' positions.  Diplomatic, economic, and military resources can be used to alter various factions' positions as well.  The country's overall position comes from some mathematical operation between the various factions (maybe it's just "whichever one comes out higher, along with some military or diplomatic event from outside to switch the balance").  <br/><br/>Some countries start out neutral, but have great benefits in some way.  (Some neutral countries can give big economic bonuses, therefore diplomatic and/or military resources can be used to bring them to your sphere.)  <br/><br/><b>Actions.</b>  There is a set list of actions, in each arena; the final effect is determined by the amount of resources spent in some kind of bidding/betting mechanism, in which each side can commit or withdraw (analogous to see, raise, call, and fold actions in poker).  Example: the US wants to use military resources to inflict economic damage on Japan.  It chooses a "blockade" action, which has certain game effects.  Japan can have a variety of ways to respond.  If the US's blockade action is ultimately successful, Japan takes economic damage.  Either way, the US's military resources are spent.  <br/><br/><b>Items/events</b>.  There may be specific items or events that have their own special effects, such as generals, weapons systems, resource discoveries, and the like.  <br/><br/><b>Technical/Scientific Progress</b>  There may be a "progress" track or indicator for each country or sphere.  This is an abstract indicator.  Countries that are ahead gain bonuses (somehow equating to bonuses to actions, bonus resources, or bonus hit points to one arena or another), and countries that are behind receive penalties.  There may be a sweeping line of progress that reduces ongoing bonuses (but won't necessarily reduce penalties - if you're behind, you stay behind, but if you're ahead, everyone else catches up.  There's sort of a "pack" and you can be either ahead of the pack, in the middle, or behind.).  <br/><br/><b>Covert operations</b>  Some way of achieving covert action?  Not necessarily hidden information, but maybe one action per turn that each player can perform that the other can't react to (to represent intelligence gathering, sabotage, false flag operations, and the like).  <br/><br/><b>Board representation?</b>  Axis and Allies-style, with maps and countries and territories?  Illuminati style, with a schematic rendering of relationships?  Cards?  This sounds really complex and maybe a bit tactical, but how can you have a World War II game without a large map of the world?<br/><br/>What do you spend resources on?  \n<ul>\n<li> Military resources can be used against military (representing battles), economic (representing blockades and torpedoing shipping), political (bombing the homeland to reduce political will), or industrial (bombing industrial capacity), or can be used to oppose diplomatic activity.  <br/></li><li> Diplomatic resources can be used against political (to favor one faction or another in another country), economic (get a producer to switch sides), or military (representing an armistice or cease fire).  <br/></li><li> Industrial resources are used to provide military resources and political will.  <br/></li><li> Economic resources are used to improve industrial base.  <br/></li><li> Political resources are used to keep an internal faction in power, and are also spent on diplomatic power.  <br/></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255246/#Comment_255246" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T13:31:25+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  1:31PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Goals:</b>  Goals vary by country.  Different countries within a sphere might have goals that differ or conflict with one another.  In order to win the war, all (or a majority) of your countries have to achieve their goals.  Differing factions could very well have different goals, and which goals will win you the war could depend on a last-minute factional switch!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
