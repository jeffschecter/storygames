                            Thief.<br/><br/>You are stealing my thunder, nevermind I don't have any.<br/><br/>But as an answer, I'd say that good story-games enable you to create stories. The question on whether they teach it or not? No, they create them and you need to do the learning on your own. Learning how to create a good story-game is very much learning to create a good story, amongst other things.<br/><br/>A good movie tells you a story, it does not necessarily tell you how to create such a story on your own.                        </div>

                            Good stories have tension.<br/><br/>In story games, tension arises from all kinds of stuff. In fact, I'd say just about everything in a smartly-written story game connects in some way to tension: character and situation creation, conflict, scene framing, escalation and so on.<br/><br/>Any time where you're playing a game and the scene feels like it's dragging, or you're not invested: probably no tension.                        </div>

                            For me, a good story raises at least one question that I have to know the answer to, and I care about the characters.<br/>
<br/>
As examples of questions, each time I've played Primetime Adventures it's certainly raised questions for me about how problems with the characters' Issues are going to manifest, and how they'll be dealt with. In Dogs in the Vineyard, I guess the question is a Setting-based one, what the hell is wrong with this town and how much is it going to hurt before we finally heal it?<br/>
<br/>
As for caring about characters, I'm not sure I've seen games with mechanical support for that - although I guess group setting creation is a big step in the direction of being invested and engaged with all the various PCs and NPCs.                        </div>

                            I don't think that playing a story game is the same as telling a story (in the same way that I don't think that playing a war game is the same as fighting a war).<br/>
<br/>
The act of actually telling a story is quite noticeably different from the act of playing a story game (or any game).<br/>
<br/>
I am of two minds about whether the skills taught by story games translate into better story-telling.  I think that the games can help you see some interesting <i>questions</i> to ask yourself as you tell a story.  But I don't think the games give you the <i>answers</i> for anything story-telling related.  I think that if you want to cross-train then you need to make the effort to use games as an inspiration, but to develop your own story-telling skills in a story-telling context.                        </div>

Tony is wise. That's why Zeus lets him live.<br/><br/>Books on writing can be useful if only that they give you a name for all the bits of a story that you like or dislike. Jerome Stern's <i>Making Shapely Fiction</i>, for example, combines a list of scene styles --shapes, he calls them-- followed by about 200 pages of glossary terms combined with advice. Suddenly you have a name for this thing you've been doing, and you have some references and advice to go with it.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nate</cite>alot of the games i read and most that i play seem to address character and never address plot.</blockquote>
When I think plot, I think cause-and-effect, combined with constantly raised stakes for the character. Like, "I stood up to the school bully, and because of that the other kids at school want me to protect them, and now the bully has backup."<br/><br/>It's present in some games. Ron has bangs in Sorcerer. Vincent talks on his blog about increasing the pressure on a character. Trollbabe has a means of dialing up the stakes between adventures. Dogs has escalation, etc.<br/><br/>But I agree with you overall.  Some GM's know how to do that on their own, but the game texts I've seen generally arent' the best teaching tools.                        </div>

                            Nate, I suggest checking out Robert McKee's "STORY" from your local library.  For what it is, it's helpful in thinking about these things.<br/>
<br/>
These are necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for a story:<br/>
* A beginning, middle and end, usually in that order<br/>
* Character(s)<br/>
* Setting(s)<br/>
* Conflict(s)<br/>
* Themes<br/>
* Style<br/>
<br/>
Avant-garde stories might jettison some of these, with greater or lesser success.<br/>
<br/>
Role-playing games involve these elements, and give you tooks for adressing them.  I think the big achievement with "story games" is that there's a much greater focus on themes: essentially, hardwiring thematic issues.  But this doesn't mean deeper understandings of character/settings/conflicts/pacing couldn't be advanced.  For that matter, I haven't seen "style" addressed <i>at all</i>, and I figure that's an open frontier right now.  What if there were games that helped you to <i>tell</i> the story better?<br/>
<br/>
I actually disagree a little bit with Tony: the end product of a story-game doesn't look much like a piece of polished <i>writing</i>, but IME you always get a story--you can't avoid it--and it's usually a pretty decent genre story.                        </div>

                            Story is not a thing, it is a category of things.  Asking "what is story?" is like asking "what is love?" or "what is politics?"  You will get far, far more useful answers if you first figure out what kind of story you're actually after.                        </div>
