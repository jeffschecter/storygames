I found some other players' actual play accounts really useful in trying to figure out how the game is supposed to work, so I figured I'd post my own. For reference, the game I ran combined a pared-down version of the plot from The Bloodstone Idol (an adventure in the Dungeon World basic rulebook) with a few elements from Jason Morningstar's Temple of Ungu one-shot (like its random item deck and its funky map). The way we played, the Bloodstone Idol is a giant statue of the Serpent-God Ungu, and is a magical tool of chaos instead of order. So....<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>The adventurers began their quest outside the entrance to the Temple of Ungu. They'd been hired by some nobles to figure out what Grundloch the Master of Arcane Clay was up to; everyone was a little nervous that he disappeared into the Temple and somehow brought under his control the previously warring goblins (who'd settled in the temple years ago) and lizardmen (who'd showed up more recently in an attempt to revive the cult of Ungu). The unease between the sides was still clear: When the warrior flubbed his attempt to spy on them from a distance, attracting their attention, he simply charged into a group of lizardman guards, ignored by the goblins. Five lizardmen later, the adventurers shooed off the skittish goblins and entered unmolested. <br/><br/>Inside, the adventurers busted their way into a vault full of human remains, battling some ghosts, and helping another to see the sun and pass to the next life in exchange for some information. (The lost souls were sacrifices to the Idol, and Grundloch would likely figure out how to make such a sacrifice himself to activate it.) Heading back inside, the PCs headed in the other direction and found a camp full of goblins, including children. They attempted to bribe their way through\xa0camp, but quickly realized they had no leverage to parley with: Grundloch was paying decently, and he promised to help them wipe out their enemies once his "project" was completed. (He probably told the lizardmen the same thing, but somehow this never occurred to the players.) The PCs headed back to the vault of ghosts, battling their way through to a room where the goblins had imprisoned a demon. The demon tried to bargain his way out, but paladins are famously stubborn when it comes to slaying evil. The demon tried to magically plunge the room into darkness, but the wizard could create magic light, so it didn't slow them down much. The adventurers found some pretty sweet treasures in this room, including fireproof armor, a dangerously magic sword, and a weird ring that could let them use shadows as portals \u2026\xa0or do bad things, depending on the roll. <br/><br/>After getting past a traps and a scuffle with guards unscathed, the PCs faced Grundloch himself, cleaning blood off a sacrificial knife as he stood before the Bloodstone Idol \u2013\xa0a giant statue of Ungu himself. (Every time the players delayed their progress for a rest or to check for loot, I made "off-screen" GM moves, which advanced Grundloch's progress until he was right about to activate the idol. If they'd showed up earlier, they might've even prevented the sacrifice.) Grundloch was quite reasonable, trying to explain his cause as just: The nobles who hired the PCs were actually arming both the lizardmen and goblins, hoping their conflict would terrify local holdings enough to accept the nobles' rule, so Grundloch meant to use the Idol's power to replace the corrupt governors with the justice of chaos. The paladin detected Grundloch was not evil, but the Idol sure was, so the adventurers tore him to pieces.<br/><br/>It just so happened, however, that the fighter knocked Grundloch's body into the sacrificial pool at the very moment that the wizard succeeded in wresting power over the Idol from Grundloch. Recognizing the sacrifice, the Idol offered the wizard a choice: How to use its power? She commanded it to implode and take the Temple with it. As they began to draw toward the sacrificial pool, rocks falling from the ceiling, the wizard produced her Ring of Beckoning Shadows and offered the longest command it would accept: "Back home." She rolled an 11\xa0\u2013\xa0full success.<br/><br/>Stumbling into the wizard's living room, the adventurers heard the distant roar of an ancient temple collapsing in on itself. They went to collect their reward from a cadre of unscrupulous nobles, and tried not to think about all the innocent goblin children harmed in the making of this epic conclusion.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385952/#Comment_385952" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-29T20:05:07+00:00" title="July 29, 2012  8:05PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2012 8:05PM by JasonT.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, a few questions/concerns that came up during play:<br/><br/>1) I went in unsure of how to handle XP/advancement, given that I've read a few different approaches. We ended up using a modified version of the advancement rules from the beta edition, leveling up every 7+level XP, but a bit accelerated (giving XP on the spot for fulfilling alignment, and allowing them to level between battles instead of during a long rest). Everybody got to level 2, and one (with really poor luck in rolls) almost got to level 3. It worked great for a one-shot, as I just wanted XP to feel meaningful without constant leveling to get in the way, but I wondered if you'd need to advance characters more slowly than every level+7 during a longer campaign. (Then again, as my players pointed out, you'll fail rolls less and less as you boost your stats.)<br/><br/>2) I ended up taking the Bard out of the list of character options at the beginning because one of its starting moves is basically a healing move with no obvious downside as long as it's used outside of battle. Am I missing something, or can you just keep healing your buddies until they are full up, with no risk of harming yourself? Unless I'm reading it wrong, this makes the Bard a much better healer than the Paladin (who hurts himself on a 7-9) or the Cleric (at least at lower levels, as her healing works through spells that have possible negative effects).<br/><br/>3) Our biggest point of confusion, I think, was exactly when NPCs made hard moves. I always made a hard move or offered players a truly gruesome choice when they rolled a 6 or less, but mostly I was asking, "The monster attacks you! What do you do?" As a result, monsters pretty much only actually did damage when players rolled a 6 or less, or a 7-9 on Hack &amp; Slash or Cast a Spell. This made it feel like the players had such narrative control that it practically amounted to having the upper hand in fights (at least compared to D&amp;D's initiative system, where you can basically just lose entire an turn to a miss while enemies act autonomously of how PCs act), but maybe that's how it's supposed to feel..?<br/><br/>Anyway, it was a great time overall, the magic rules are a sensible and fun twist on the oldschool D&amp;D approach, and I'm excited to play more games with this resolution system. Thanks for reading; comments are welcome. (And I haven't really written actual play posts much before, so I hope it didn't screw it up too badly somehow.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385955/#Comment_385955" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-29T21:18:35+00:00" title="July 29, 2012  9:18PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for posting this here.  I really enjoy AP and Dungeon World AP is the absolute cherry on the my AP sundae.<br/><br/>You can hack XP advancement to taste w/o mucking up anything.  DW is very flexible that way.  Come to think of it, I've hacked XP advancement in every edition of D&amp;D as well.<br/><br/>In several beta playtests I've never had anyone pick the Bard.  Off to look at the concern you raise...<br/><br/>I make hard moves and deal damage pretty much only as you describe but all of my Dungeon World GM'ing experience feels to me like the PCs are really on the ropes at levels 1 and 2.  Lots of PCs making the Death move.  Lots.  Maybe just some tweaking on the opposition levels?  Were the players rolling particularly well? Not sure what I'd recommend here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385956/#Comment_385956" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-29T21:27:53+00:00" title="July 29, 2012  9:27PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We never had anybody making the Last Breath move, but then again, the Fighter and the Paladin both have pretty nice armor (2 and 3) and rolled a lot of 10's, so they really took very little damage. The Wizard is more vulnerable, but the Paladin used the Defend move practically every time she attracted unwanted attention (and my approach to that was say she was drawing enemies toward her first, as a soft move on my part, rather than having them immediately deal damage to her). I might have also been overly generous with NPCs' willingness to gang up on the PCs; I let the PCs avoid a lot of fights with NPCs who could've been hostile, and when they rolled a 7-9 or 6-, I generally only had them trigger an attack from a single enemy instead of everyone adjacent to them. I imagine they would've gone down a lot faster if a 7-9 on Hack &amp; Slash triggered attacks from five lizardmen at a time, but I didn't read the move as working that way (and on rolls of 6- I generally just had them take double damage, or damage ignoring armor, or a choice between getting hit hard or dropping an item, etc.). They also just lucked out a couple times, like when I forgot that ghosts have 5 armor vs. Hack &amp; Slash, and by the time I remembered, the Wizard got off a sweet magic missile (which bypasses armor on ghosts, killing it instantly).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385999/#Comment_385999" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T18:44:38+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  6:44PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2012 6:48PM by noclue.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> I don't have the Bard in front of me, but all moves come with risk.

Yeah, the GM makes a move on a miss, I was just surprised at how low-risk the Bard's 7-9 roll was. "On a 7-9, you also draw unwanted attention or your magic reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM's choice." That's a super interesting result in the heat of battle, but if you're just taking a breather between fights, the worst case scenario is that you've got another fight on your hands (which they were likely to plunge into next anyway). Then again, I'd forgotten that "you draw unwanted attention" is also among the cleric's choices on a 7-9 (and generally less frustrating than taking -1 ongoing or forgetting the spell entirely), so maybe they're simply comparably powerful. (It seems pretty kind compared to the Paladin's Lay on Hands, though, on which a 7-9 actively injures the Paladin!)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.

They pretty much only looked to me to see what happened in two kinds of situations: after entering a new room, and after speaking to an NPC. So, I respond to these with soft moves: telling them what happens when they go into the room (or narrating what they see, which I guess isn't a move in itself..?), and telling them the NPC's response (definitely a soft move). <br/><br/>I think I'm being vague\xa0here. Let me give a clearer, non-combat example to illustrate my confusion about when the GM gets to make moves: <br/><br/>More than once, the PCs got into conversations with NPCs, trying to bluff or bargain their way past them without a fight. In each case, we had a really long and rambling back-and-forth because we just kept lobbing soft moves: They lie or make an offer; the NPCs respond in a way that invites a hard move (probably a Parley roll) or clarifies that the PCs actually have no leverage; but it's not the answer the PCs want, so the PCs keep laying down BS in the hopes of persuading the NPCs through soft moves. Eventually I tell the players out of character that they NEED to make a hard move to move the story forward. They succeed or fail, I make a hard move if they fail, and we move on. <br/><br/>I'm wondering in retrospect, however, whether I could've made my hard move earlier. When they're just BSing with NPCs and refusing to make a hard move (or forgetting that they can), does that count as "if they don't deal with your soft moves," freeing me up to start doing hard moves? Or does it at least free me up to offer a completely different kind of soft move that sets up a hard move? Like, "The goblin champion is clearly growing tired of this endless debate. He draws his sword and starts to move." If they don't respond to that soft move with an appropriate hard move (Defy Danger, Hack and Slash, even a last ditch attempt at Parley), can the next move I make actually involve an attack (whether for damage or other effect)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386051/#Comment_386051" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T10:40:43+00:00" title="July 31, 2012 10:40AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could have them defy danger with charisma to avoid offending the goblin champion or having him realize the deceit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386058/#Comment_386058" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T11:59:44+00:00" title="July 31, 2012 11:59AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also I think only the MC makes hard or soft moves. The PCs just make moves. From your description it seems that maybe you have a meta-thing going on with your players whereby you are telling each other that moves are hard or soft? IMO that is a no-no. Never speak the name of a move.<br/>MC Soft move = something happens that the players get a chance to react to/avoid ("arrows fly at you, what do you do?")<br/>MC Hard move = something happens, players then must deal with consequences ("the arrows hit you in the chest and leg, you feel your own blood running down the inside of your armour, take 5HP, what do you do?")<br/><br/>For me "players trying to bluff NPCs" = players must roll their move (AKA if you do it [\xecn fiction], do it [roll the move])<br/>That roll tells you how to resolve the bluffing incident. AW (hence DW) is IMO v fast to resolve things. So much so that there is lots of advice to slow down.<br/>Obviously lots of banter at the table is good but if you want to push things along IMO its easy.<br/><br/>rgds<br/>rob<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_386064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386064/#Comment_386064" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-31T12:20:45+00:00" title="July 31, 2012 12:20PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very good point on Defy Danger.

MC/GM moves are 100% fictional (the names / moves only exist to help you come up with stuff).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
