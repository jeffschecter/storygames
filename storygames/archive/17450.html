Seconds after I snottily yell at people that high school is full of immature people treating each other like garbage and you can't put that at the feet of a set of game rules, I can run over to rpgnow and pick up, for less than $25, the original Vampire the Masquerade 1st Edition rules and the Player's Guide.  These books are both from 1991. They are the Brain Damagy-est of all Brain Damage books. They supposedly support railroading and vicious GM domination of the players.  Let's put on our bike helmets and find out together, shall we? <br/><br/>The Players Guide is a scans of images, the worst kind of gaming PDFs there are. But the original text/submissions have clearly been lost in the intervening <b>21 fucking years</b>.  Along with your own reliable memories of what was in these books, what you said to that girl and what she said to you, what really happened under the bleachers at the big game, and which play you did your junior year and which one you did your senior year.<br/><br/>So, 1991. George Bush was President. The first Gulf War begins. President Lech Walesa of Poland visits the United States.  Jeffrey Dahmer and Mike Tyson are arrested.  The USSR is dissolved.<br/><br/>And here we are sitting down to learn how to play this new game of Vampire.<br/><br/>The first fifteen pages of the book are in-character setting material from DRAKKULA wut, this is actually pretty great.  Anyway, next.\n<blockquote>This is a game of make-believe, of pretend, of storytelling.  Though a game, it is more about storytelling than it is about winning. If you've never done this kind of thing before, you may be confused by the whole premise of a storytelling game.  But once you catch on, you'll find that it isn't all that strange.<br/><br/>You, along with some of your friends are going to weave wondrous tales.  Stories of monsters and creatures of the night.  Tales of peril, horror and sinister, shadowy evil.  And at the heart of it all are Vampires.  These stories are of a more grim and dark nature than the fairy and dark nature than  the  fairy  tales  that you might remember (though those too were rather grim if  you think back), and they will capture your imagination and involve you far more deeply than any play or movie. This is because you're  inside the story and not  just watching it.  This game  is your opportunity to truly <br/>experience horror, not  just watch  it. <br/><br/>This storytelling game provides a way to experience a  terror of an all  too  immediate nature,  for  it allows  you  to experience the horror from  the other side of the mirror.  The horror of Vampire  is the curse of what  it  is like to be half-beast and  half-angel,  trapped  in  a  world  of no  absolutes,  where morality is chosen, not ordained. The horror of Vampire  is the stirrings of  the Beast within and the cravings for warm blood. <br/>Perhaps  the greatest  risk of playing Vampire  is seeing yourself in the mirror.  To play this game, you must bear witness to the madness  within  you,  that  which  you  strive  to  master  and overcome, that which you cannot bear to face. <br/><br/>Unless you are willing  to  face  the reflection of your own imperfections, then  this game is not for you. </blockquote>\nAwesome, this game sounds great. I have a clear picture of what the goal of this game is.  There is simply no way you can get through that section without knowing what the GOAL of the game is. I still don't know what to DO, but I have a clear picture of what the game is headed.<br/><br/>The next page or two contains some stuff about why stories are important/cool, but we're nerdy reading types in high school, whatever, we already know stories are great. Let's get to how to play.\n<blockquote>Vampire  is  not  only  a  storytelling  game,  but  a  roleplaying game as well.  You not only tell stories, but you also act  through them. Roleplaying is a type  of interactive  storytelling. As a player of Vampire, you will  take on the persona and role of a  character which you  create,  and  then  pretend  to  be  that character during the course of the story. One of the players is the Storyteller, who creates and guides  the story.  The Storyteller describes what happens as a result of what the players say and do.  It is the Storyteller who decides if  the characters succeed or fail,  suffer or prosper, live or die. <br/><br/>Ultimately,  the  life  of a  character  is  in  the  player's hands, for the player decides what the character says and does. The player decides what risks  to accept or decline. Everything you do when you play your  character has an effect  on the world. Characters are central  to a  story,  for  they create and direct the plot- without characters you can't have a story. As the story flows,  it is the characters who direct and energize the progress of the plot, not the decisions of the Storyteller. </blockquote>\nWelp, so much for that "storyteller is a brutal overlord" theory. What's interesting is that it's the CHARACTERS that direct the plot, not ANY of the players, especially not the Storyteller...<br/><br/>More to come!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395125/#Comment_395125" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T11:16:34+00:00" title="October 28, 2012 11:16AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2012 11:17AM by JackFractal.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know this is nit-picky and not really interesting, but it does directly contradict itself there.\n<blockquote>It is the Storyteller who decides if  the characters succeed or fail,  suffer or prosper, live or die. </blockquote>\nOK, so the Storyteller decides who lives and who dies.<br/><br/>And then the very next sentence. \n<blockquote>Ultimately,  the  life  of a  character  is  in  the  player's hands, for the player decides what the character says and does. </blockquote>\nWait what?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395126/#Comment_395126" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T11:31:09+00:00" title="October 28, 2012 11:31AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2012 11:36AM by JDCorley.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think in context of the whole thing the contradiction is a bit less. The player decides on a macro level where the plot goes. "Ultimately" whether his character lives or dies is in her hands. She chooses what direction the plot is going and what situations the character gets into. The Storyteller resolves how those situations end up. (The rules also help.)<br/><br/>Kind of like D&amp;D sandbox play.  The player decided to send their character into the dangerous monster-filled area. The DM rolls the dice that determine whether they do in fact die. The player is "ultimately" responsible in that situation.  At least that is how this setup considers it.<br/><br/>But you're right, there is some contradiction there. I think in the context of the rest of the book it works.<br/><br/>By the way, if anyone can figure out how to make blockquotes stand out a bit more, I'd appreciate a primer in whisper or just in the thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395128/#Comment_395128" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T11:41:07+00:00" title="October 28, 2012 11:41AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2012 11:43AM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Obviously some cross-posting is involved here, but I'm sure we can handle that as old forum hands.)<br/><br/>Rock on, Jason! I'm all for first-hand analysis of historical rpg texts. A couple of observations:<br/><br/>Regarding the goals and purpose of the game, you say that it's made very clear in that introduction. For the sake of clarity, I'll say how I understand that text: it seems to say that the game is about cooperatively creating stories which are experienced from a first-person viewpoint, as characters in it. Fair enough.<br/><br/>As for who is the brutal overlord here, I find that the text you quote is remarkably honest about being the exact sort of game people tend to accuse Vampire of being. Check it out:<br/><br/><b>"The Storyteller describes what happens as a result of what the players say and do. It is the Storyteller who decides if the characters succeed or fail, suffer or prosper, live or die."</b><br/><br/>And then:<br/><br/><b>"Characters are central to a story, for they create and direct the plot- without characters you can't have a story. As the story flows, it is the characters who direct and energize the progress of the plot, not the decisions of the Storyteller. "</b><br/><br/>The only way I can interpret these superficially opposite sentiments as a comprehensive theory of how the game is played is as follows: the game is about character-driven stories where we are most interested in the internal states of the characters. The Storyteller actually decides everything about what happens in the external world, effectively, as he has total control over resolution systems ("decides of the characters succeed or fail"), but the other players get to decide whether their characters feel sad or glad about the events. Characters "direct" the plot, the text says, but by "plot" it evidently merely means declaring actions, not outcomes: a character can try to do things and they can feel things, but it's the Storyteller who decides the external consequences, and he also decides the environment in which the character acts. The "plot" that the Vampire character directs consists of what this new millenia would term "color narration".<br/><br/>This is actually exactly the way I've understood Vampire to work. Do you think that this is what the text is attempting to convey, Jason, or am I simply reading too much into what is after all just the introductory section? The book will no doubt provide us with more material to aid our understanding, so we both might be jumping the gun here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395130/#Comment_395130" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T11:44:12+00:00" title="October 28, 2012 11:44AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>One of the players is the Storyteller, who creates and guides the story.</b><br/><br/>Case closed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395131/#Comment_395131" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T11:47:27+00:00" title="October 28, 2012 11:47AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your interpretation of the introductory bit makes sense, Jason - I can see how that might be what it means. My D&amp;D sandbox works exactly like that (insofar as direction of play is concerned; resolution is not by GM fiat): the player decides that his character is going to go to Paris, and this decision then sets up the environment and material the GM is going to present. It's a challenging mode of play, as the GM can't really prep much in advance when the players might just decide that hey, we'll switch tracks and stop interacting with the NPCs and places we've done so far, and instead just go to Paris.<br/><br/>But by all means, do proceed in your reading. I'm sure you'll find some remarkably interesting snippets for us to mull over in there. Regarding block quotes, they've been fucked since the forum software upgrade; somebody would need to write in some better CSS for them. My inclination would be to suck it up, or perhaps manually change the font color for the entire block quote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395132/#Comment_395132" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T11:48:03+00:00" title="October 28, 2012 11:48AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2012 11:52AM by JackFractal.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your mention of the rules is very important to a lot of the flaws of this style of game. <br/><br/>Lets look at these three sentences here:\n<blockquote><i>One of the players is the Storyteller, who creates and guides the story. The Storyteller describes what happens as a result of what the players say and do. It is the Storyteller who decides if the characters succeed or fail, suffer or prosper, live or die. </i></blockquote>\nThis is unambiguous. The Storyteller, not the group, creates and guides the story. They describe the results of what the players do, and they <i>decide</i> if the characters succeed or fail. The rules don't adjudicate, the <i>storyteller</i> decides.<br/><br/>I think that the emphasis in books like Burning Wheel and Apocalypse World saying, in short, "Do not do this! The dice decide. Follow these rules."  are as a response to this style, and a conscious effort to break the kind of habits that this sort of permission creates. As someone who often ends up in the GM role, the kind of responsibility that this text tells me to take up is immense. If it's my job to decide <i>everything</i> then the ultimate success or failure of every situation is in my hands. If the game sucks, its always my fault. <br/><br/>That caused a lot of anxiety for me when I started playing Vampire back in the day. <br/><br/>RE: Blockquotes, I have no idea.

The consequences are decided by the Storyteller, but the only consequences that matter are consequences of <i>character decisions</i>.  This is exactly, <i>exactly</i> "playing to find out what happens", if we must take some piece of indie game jargon today back in time 21 years and try to fit it in here.<br/><br/>Their decisions create the events of the story.

They are used mainly  to  avoid arguments, "Bang!  Bang! You're dead - No I'm not!" and add a deeper sense of realism  to  the  story.  Rules direct  the progress of  the story,  and  help  define  the  capacities  and  weaknesses  of  the characters.  These rules are described in  the following chapter. </blockquote>\nSo I do think the rules provide some "direction" to the story, but you're right, the players, including the Storyteller, direct it much more - remember that the characters' decisions create and advance the plot, though, so it's not all on the Storyteller. You don't have to decide what "direction" to go in, the characters and the rules will do that for you.

Here's what Vampire: The Masquerade, First Edition, said about the role of the Storyteller in 1991, on pages 20 and 21, right up front:\n<blockquote>The Storyteller's primary duty is to make sure  the other players have a good  time.  The way  to do  that is  to  tell  a good story.  Unlike traditional Storytellers, however, you don't sim\xadply tell the story, you create  the story and then you let the players live it out in  the roles of the primary characters.  It is a careful balance between narration and adjudication, between story and game.  Sometimes  you  must  set  the  scene  or  describe what occurs  (such as when the  characters were  asleep),  but <b>mostly you must decide what occurs in reaction to  the words and actions of the characters - as fairly and impartially as you can.</b> <br/><br/>As the Storyteller, you are going to have to create and guide stories for the enjoyment of  the other players.  <b>You are in charge as a umpire or coach</b>, yet you are also an entertainer \xadyou must balance your two roles. Most of  this book was written to help you do just that.  Not to make being a Storyteller easy, because it never will be, but to make you better at it. </blockquote>\nThe bolding is mine.  <br/><br/>MOSTLY what a Storyteller does - the majority - is that you decide what occurs <i>in reaction</i> to the words and actions of the characters.  This is the main thing a Storyteller does - describe how the world reacts to the words and actions of the characters.<br/><br/>And what authority does the Storyteller have (versus the responsibility of being an entertainer?)  The authority is that of an umpire or coach, neither of whom have significant control over how a baseball game plays out. A coach gives advice and analyzes the overall situation of the game.  The umpire makes sure everyone follows the rules and nobody gets hurt.  But their contribution, certainly compared to the decisions and skill of the players, do not determine the outcome of the game.  It's the players <i>play</i> that determines the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395138/#Comment_395138" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T12:03:21+00:00" title="October 28, 2012 12:03PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2012 12:04PM by JDCorley.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm going to go over the introductory material, skip a lot of the world stuff (though I may summarize it a bit because I think the mechanics also support my position) and then get to the more detailed "how to play" stuff at the end.

Well except for:<br/>*What happens when the roll fails. Sure, there are guidelines but the GM ultimately makes stuff up. In BW, you're supposed to 'fail forward' and make it interesting, but the balls in your court based on your situation and players  as to what is interesting. In AW, you may pick a move, but how the MC interprets it is still up to the MC. If you Separate the PCs, you still need to place that in the context of the fictional situation.<br/><br/>*Who are the bandits attacking the town? The nobles trying to steal the crown? Sure, the PCs will often have an impact on this, but those are still human making shit up. And the GM is going to be making a lot of calls here, even if they use the circles system or ask lots of questions like AW says.<br/><br/>*Lots of other things, like the look and feel of the world in either game. What kind of strange creatures are in the world? What's the sorurce of magic or the psychic maelstrom? Are gods real? If so, what are they like?<br/><br/>And from what I've seen, the best World of Darkness games, like Vampire and (although I may be alone in this opinion) Werewolf: The Forsaken, provide different but existent tools to guide the game and make it easy to make GM judgement calls. They could be written more clearly and better organized for use, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395147/#Comment_395147" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T12:53:01+00:00" title="October 28, 2012 12:53PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The differences in use of GM decision-making are mostly in the reasons and limits. The traditional rpg will state that the GM has wide powers of decision-making because it's his job to bring the fun and this requires wide executive freedom to mess with things. This is completely different from the itemized GM responsibilities of your average proge design like say Apocalypse World. Of course not in all ways (it's still the GM making decisions), but in some pretty important ways that matter: the AW GM cannot pre-empt procedures arbitrarily to save a game, nor is it his sole responsibility to ensure that the game succeeds. He does not use authority when he executes one of his responsibilities, he merely fulfills a responsibility assigned to him by the rules and the group.<br/><br/>I for one would find a game where dice decide everything to be a... dice game. I mean, evidently it can't be a roleplaying game, unless dice have learned to speak all of a sudden. Of course you need to leave room in your game design for individual players - possible GM included - to make choices.<br/><br/>All this I write to clarify that "GM fiat" does not mean "the GM does things". It means "GM uses ill-defined supreme authority bestowed upon him by the virtue of his position". By this definition Apocalypse World is, indeed, fiat-free, and everything the GM does in the game is done at the behest of the constitutional process and not because he feels like it today.<br/><br/>As for whether Vampire involves GM fiat in this sense of extraordinary powers outside of the system, I'll be interested in Jason's take. It seems to me that he's setting up an argument for the Vampire Storyteller being merely or mostly an umpire whose primary responsibility is to introduce a situation, let the players make choices and then bring on the consequences. If this actually proves to be the case with the game's GMing advice, then this could just be the biggest misread of a roleplaying game since the dramatization of D&amp;D. Elaborate GM-designed campaigns with preplanned themes and plot arcs are considered almost a Whitewolf trademark, after all.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395150/#Comment_395150" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T13:15:20+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  1:15PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have an idea!

I think by the time Second Edition rolled around in 1992, "freeform Vampire" was explicitly stated as a potential structure for the game group.  I know "rotating Storytellers" was (something else that militates away from Storyteller-as-dictator.)  I can't remember if any of this was in First Edition in 1991 though.\n<blockquote>for a group that's <i>not</i> running smoothly, it gives <i>no help</i> in resolving the argument.  "See, look, I'm right!"  "No, look, <i>I'm</i> right!"</blockquote>\nYes, definitely. This is describing what play is supposed to be. It isn't really talking about what happens when something goes wrong. (Actually there is very little about that in any game, compared to providing exemplars/instruction for good play.)<br/><br/>And Deliverator, my lad, I don't see anything contradictory between "telling a good story" and "deciding what the consequences of character action are".  Virtually all stories are about the consequences of character action are.  All the target stories for Vampire were. <br/><br/>Thark, the organization of the book is definitely really rough. I'll talk about that at some point, remind me if I forget.<br/><br/>A lot of the "railroady" stuff that people remember from that time period was based around module play. (And indeed, if you looked to modules for examples of how-to-play-this-game, not an unusual or incorrect thing to do, you could bring that into your normal gameplay.)  This wasn't the fault of 90s games, though. Railroading modules and their impact hit the hobby way, way before the 90s.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395158/#Comment_395158" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T13:39:20+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  1:39PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2012 1:41PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>MOSTLY what a Storyteller does - the majority - is that you decide what occurs <i>in reaction</i> to the words and actions of the characters.

To play Vampire you need to create a character, and then you need to roleplay that character.  Being a player  does not  require as much responsibility as being a Storyteller, but  just as much effort and concentration.  You begin the game in  the role of a Vampire \xadone  newly  created  and  as  yet  unfamiliar  with  the  world  of Vampires.  You must be both an actor and a player. <br/><br/>As an actor, you speak  for your character and act out whatever you wish your character to do or say.  Whatever you say, your character says,  unless  you  are specifically asking  a question of the Storyteller or are describing your actions.  By announcing  and describing  to  the other players what you are doing, you become a part of the ongoing story.  You  try to do things which allow your character to succeed, so as to "win the game."  This strategy element of the game is essential, for  it is what so  often  creates  the  thrill  and  excitement of a  dramatic moment. <br/><br/>Often after describing  the actions you want to  take, you will need to make dice rolls to see if you succeed in doing what you  have illustrated with words.  Your Character Traits, descriptions of  your strengths and weaknesses, dictate how well you can do certain things.  Actions are a basic part of Vampire, for  they describe how characters change the world. <br/><br/>To be a good player, you must become both an  actor and a  strategist - balancing  the personality  and  survival  instincts of  your  character. You try to  "win"  the game by  employing your character's strengths and working around your character's weaknesses.<br/><br/>To some extent, you are also  the Storyteller and may add  ideas and elements to  the story which  the Storyteller may  accept or  reject as she sees fit.  In the end, it is the story, not the character, which  is  the most important. </blockquote>\nThis is actually way more contradictory than the role-of-the-Storyteller stuff, but what leaps out at me is:<br/><br/>* Your job is to get your character to succeed by roleplaying them. You, like they, will want to play to their strengths and avoid their weaknesses.  What this means is you are not holding your character at arm's length and watching them play out a tragic story. You are to battle as hard as you can to avoid tragedy and achieve victory.  In crucial situations, the player's investment in their character's success is what makes that situation dramatic.<br/><br/>* At the same time, you're in collaboration with someone who is going to be portraying the environment and determining the outcome of what you do (in direction with the rules). In the end you're going to have to let go of that devotion to your character and see it as a audience member.  <br/><br/>This hard, hard, HARD identification between player and character is unusual for games, not just in the present day, but throughout the history of the hobby. In fact (looking ahead), there are around two more pages where the game urges you to recognize parts of yourself in the character you create, and opines that when you roleplay you are always playing some element of yourself.  So that last sentence about "the story" being more important is really the outlier here.  That second bullet point of mine is by FAR the weaker of the two.<br/><br/>The "winning" aspect of Vampire comes up again next and it gets refined. But "how to play", as in, how I decide to announce what my character does, is pretty much done at this point. I make that decision based on the character's goals and abilities.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395161/#Comment_395161" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T14:07:04+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  2:07PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gosh I love this, JDCorley.

I can get behind the idea of a challenge-oriented game where established fiction matters deeply, as my own D&amp;D campaign is like that, but here there's also the added ideal of character immersion. I wonder how that's supposed to play out in practice. Maybe I should play this game sometime. The fluff of Vampire certainly is good, I dig that part.<br/><br/>All in all, though, I think that David has a good point here: the fact that we can parse a coherent game out of a text that buckshots every imaginable rpg buzzword of the time at the reader just means that we're reading with an agenda. Similarly of course a game text that doesn't quite say everything you need to understand it gets a pass with me if it was intended for a historical context where that missing information was widely known and acknowledged. Jason's quotes remind me more of the former end of the range, as it does seem to me that this game text has already managed to throw in lures for every possible type of goal a roleplayer might have had at the time. We've got telling stories, theatre, competition, character immersion and so on. (This, by the way, is the major cornerstone of what I think the tradition of trad-type rpg design is really all about: writing non-committal game texts that everybody can interpret in the way that makes them the happiest.)<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that we'll want to see more of what the book tells us, especially concrete steps of play. I mean, we'll understand what the book really means by the storyteller deciding everything or the characters really determining direction of play once we see what kind of play the game encourages in its play examples and GMing advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395168/#Comment_395168" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T16:11:02+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  4:11PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2012 4:14PM by JDCorley.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually was kind of surprised by the "here's how you win"  stuff in the section above. I had recollected Vampire as having the normal "you don't really win this game" kind of thing that most RPGs had.  As it turns out, this is refined a few pages later. (See what I mean, bad organization.)  I'm skipping a bit over a page here, it is basically about the stuff I outlined above - you are your character, your desire should be to work to have your character achieve their desires, put something of yourself in your character, etc.<br/><br/>Gonna try some new blockquotin' tips people have whispered me for this next section, "Winning and Losing"\n<blockquote>There  is no single  "winner"  of Vampire,  since  the  object is  not  to  defeat  the  other players.  To win  at all,  you  need  to cooperate with  the other players.  Because this is a storytelling game, there is no way to claim victory for yourself.  In fact, it  is a game in which you are  likely  to  lose,  for  it  is difficult to do  anything to slow your  character's inexorable slide into chaos. The whole idea is to hang on as long as possible, to eke out the most drama from  the ongoing tragedy. <br/><br/>The only true measure of success  in Vampire is  sur\xadviving.  If the  character  has  some  other great  overwhelming drive,  such as  revenge, accomplishing  it  is  also a measure of success.  Additionally,  stories  have  conclusions  that  either benefit or harm  the  characters.  If  the  characters  learn  that a presumed serial killer  is really a Vampire  and manage  to halt her rampage, then  they "win."  If they never even find out  just who was behind the murders, much less manage  to stop her, then they lose.<br/><br/>In  order  to  aid  victory,  the  characters  must  usually become  friends.  They  look  out  for  one  another  and  have  a modicum of  trust in each other.  The world  in which Vampires exist is so dangerous  that you need someone you can  trust for survival.  It is an evolutionary adaptation.  </blockquote>\nThis makes a lot more sense, instead of talking about winning or losing the game, Vampire asks you to shift that to winning or losing in terms of relatively smaller goals along the way, and in terms of teamwork.<br/><br/>Putting survival as the first/overarching priority is straight up a bad mistake when combined with some of the other mechanics, but that's because it actually puts too much in the hands of the players, not because it makes the Storyteller a monstrous tyrant.  It gives the players power (and here, the priority) to just straight up opt out of the game.  More on that when I talk about the mechanics.<br/><br/>Edit: Blockquoting works. What you do to get the color is put "rel=blah" in the initial blockquote tag.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395171/#Comment_395171" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T16:25:06+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  4:25PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, the Live-Action section!

The sample character rolls 6 dice for Intelligence + Streetwise, an automatic success on all average tests of finding out something on the street.  This is not even the biggest die pool that the sample character has.  NPCs must make a concerted effort to oppose them, or have superior knowledge that plays on their weaknesses, which means that the players have more opportunities to cut them out through lying or manipulation or figuring out their weaknesses and murdering them first.<br/><br/>* The basic system requires either simple tests (just roll your dice and see if you get 1 or more successes) or no rolling at all.  Everything else, including the entirety of the combat rules, are "Complications".   The advice on when to use Complications is hilarious (and dumb):\n<blockquote>There are a number of different ways to complicate  the rolls, some of them are discussed below. For  troupes heavily into roleplaying, simple rolls and automatic successes are enough. Generally, you use a complication  if you or the players want a break from  the roleplaying,  if you want to  roll a few dice, or if you want to make a game out of the scene. Complications can add drama  to  the story and create a depth of passion and  focus. </blockquote>\nIt's goofy as hell, but also note that players can choose when to use Complications and not just the Storyteller: Teamwork is one of the "basic" Complications listed.<br/><br/>* The famed messed-up botching rules really only start to be significant at super-high and super-low difficulty numbers. This is <a href="http://rpggeek.com/thread/728661/storyteller-system-flaws" rel="nofollow">ably explained here.</a>  Although they became Internet-famous, the situations in which these difficulty numbers would be used were relatively minor. Super-low difficulty numbers just used the automatic success rules.  There were some situations where stacking difficulties could get you up to that Difficulty 9-10 range if you weren't careful, though, so that was more of a problem. And note that the base rules, sans Complications, virtually never got there. You kind of had to choose to throw yourself into that pit.<br/><br/>* Not only are there sample characters, but <i>even the art</i> in the system section of the book tells a story of a Vampire girl who becomes god-Queen of her ancient city, but is torn down by a revolt, sleeps for centuries, travels the world, sees her former vampiric lover reincarnated (she thinks) and so she Embraces him, and he goes through Neonate Problems, then ends up killing her and....becoming human again!  It's pretty badass.  By the way, becoming human again is a perfectly normal thing to have as a goal in this version of the game.<br/><br/>* Not only is there a sample character but there are two pages of things the game asks you to do with his character sheet to help understand the game. Roll for him jumping across rooftops. Roll for him sneaking up on someone.  Did you succeed, fail or botch?  And so on.  It's pretty cool.  Also I think this addresses Eero's earlier point of how the system connects to what you as the player do.  You essentially practice thinking up things to do and figuring out what on your sheet helps you to do those things, and practicing the simple-test system to get a feel for the probabilities. It's cool.<br/><br/>More soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395176/#Comment_395176" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T16:51:50+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  4:51PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is interesting about Vampire.

The breadth of motivation is another reason that Vampire is an anti-railroading marvel. (It's supported by the Nature/Demeanor mechanics too, btw.)  This is also a reason that campaign design is so important to a successful Vampire game and why it's given so much space (and VERY SPECIFIC space) later in the book.<br/><br/>Any of the editions of Vampire can be played perfectly well and successfully without ever interacting with vampire politics - and this is actually supported with significant campaign design and supplemental support. So someone who doesn't communicate "this is what THIS GAME is about" is messing up, big time.  There is nothing mechanically invalid about making a character that doesn't give a shit about vampire politics, and if the game is not about that, then it's not even a bad character design decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395177/#Comment_395177" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T16:52:25+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  4:52PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you are making way too many excuses for the text, so that it reads the way you want it to read, Jason.<br/><br/>Is there a definition of "story" in the book anywhere?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395178/#Comment_395178" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T16:55:46+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  4:55PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2012 4:58PM by JDCorley.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only as a period of time.

I mean, I at least <i>obviously</i> read him as someone who's internalized the way the writer writes, so of course he's going to understand and interpret the text constructively. You should see me explaining <i>Sorcerer</i>, it's exactly the same; I'll note the places where the author didn't know how to phrase himself as clearly as we do today, and I'll make excuses for where the text just plain doesn't match up with the culture of play. At most the degree of interpretation is different, but I'm completely biased to be saying something like that.<br/><br/>Very few roleplaying game texts are so completely streamlined that there is no contradictory material in them; this is a pretty unique virtue of modern progressive design in fact, post-Forge designers know that we'll laugh at them if they actually include bullshit pro forma rules or advice they don't really mean. But it was a different world in the '90s and everybody was writing roleplaying games as part of a historical tradition of aping prior successes. Even a game that obviously was very unique and that the designer played in a very powerful, exact manner would have been written in an ambiguous and standardized manner, repeating verbiage from prior works.<br/><br/>Against this background I'm totally cool with a pretty large degree of interpretative reading. The important part is not whether every individual paragraph accords with the message, but rather how the game one would actively construct out of the textual mess actually plays. For this purpose introductory explanations are often not as important as mechanical procedures, for instance, as the latter actually actively inform what you're doing at the table, while introductory prose at the very best just puts you into the correct frame of mind to interpret the rest of the material correctly.<br/><br/>That being said, if this thread really ends with Jason triumphantly proving how Vampire never was supposed to be a railroad clearinghouse, I'll promise to read the book myself to confirm it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395183/#Comment_395183" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T17:37:04+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  5:37PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since nobody agrees with me on what railroading is anyway, I doubt I'm going to prove that to anyone's satisfaction, Eero...but I will show you that the place where Storyteller "force" happens most significantly is in campaign design.  In other words, the Storyteller CAN make your character care about vampire politics, by saying, beforehand, "This is a campaign about vampire politics, you will make characters that care about it."  And to some people that's an unreasonable request!  It certainly isn't without it's downsides.<br/><br/>So in order to satisfy the unquenchable Story Hyphen Games Dot Com lust for Two Minute Hates of Vampire, here, I'll go over why the the priority on survival and the mechanical system combine to make a big, big mistake.  <br/><br/>The needs of a Vampire for survival are pretty simple, and most are directly laid out in the system:<br/><br/>* They need a place to crash that is free of sunlight and nosy mortals.<br/>* They need a source of blood, preferably human blood.<br/><br/>And there is one more that's strongly implied in the setting material:<br/><br/>* They need political clout or allies sufficient to keep vampire politics from murdering them.<br/><br/>There are Backgrounds that can be purchased at character creation that <i>directly solve</i> all these problems: Resources, Herd and Status.  Furthermore, the experience rules are such that the Storyteller controls whether or not you will ever gain more of these Backgrounds. You can't buy them with experience.  So if your goal in this game is to survive, first and foremost, before "becoming human again" or "bringing down the corrupt Vampire power structure" or whatever other goal is concocted by the players, then you should put all your character creation points into those three things and then ruthlessly avoid doing anything risky no matter what the Storyteller does.<br/><br/>And every single vampire has a power to help them avoid being forced into risky situations!  Brujah can super-speed away and punch out a wall, Gangrel can sink into the ground and wait a few days, Ventrue could tell people to fuck right off, Tremere could do whatever they thought up, Malkavians and Nosferatu could disappear, etc. etc.<br/><br/>This is BAD DESIGN.  You literally can, <i>and according to this text, should</i> design yourself out of playing Vampire.  And according to the Storyteller advice, which is all about determining the consequences of character action, and tailoring results to the Traits of the character, the Storyteller should reward you for your successful checking-out with absolutely nothing happening to you.<br/><br/>Now, if you are more interested in other goals than in mere survival, then the Background system makes more sense and is not a big mistake.  And if (as in nWoD), you can buy up Backgrounds later, you can adjust your priorities still further.  It's the combination of the prioritization of survival and the early, guaranteed access to mechanics that can ensure survival that makes this really bad design.  If you didn't get access to these until later in play, or if there was another priority other than survival, then this would not be a problem (other than still being priced wrongly but whatever.)<br/><br/>AND this problem is exacerbated in the Player's Guide with the addition of Merits and Flaws, Merits that can be used to improve the safety/luxury of your Haven, improve the availability/nutritiousness of your Herd, and improve your protection from vampire political fallout/murdering.  DANG, this is BAD!!<br/><br/>Grr, bad Vampire! Bad design! Let's all glare at it!  Good thing I have on this bike helmet!<br/><br/>I'll find some more later if you want, it's cool by me.  But I'm gonna get back to going over How To Play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395184/#Comment_395184" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T17:37:55+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  5:37PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not asking you to smash it, but the stuff you've quoted is a poorly-written mish-mash of different GMing methods.<br/><br/>-- entertain your friends<br/>-- fair and impartial umpiring, with rules to avoid arguments<br/>-- "guide and create the story" (I mean really, wtf).<br/><br/>It seems like first and foremost the role of the Storyteller is to host and entertain, using the tools provided by the book (rules, colour, situation ideas). Which is fine, but I just wrote that out better than Mark did 21 years ago. But if that's the case, then the rules are a tool for the Storyteller to decide what happens, and if we're supposed to abide by the rules and have the Storyteller as an impartial umpire, then that's not the same thing as entertaining us. And all tehse references to "story" are particularly confusing without a definition. Isn't story what the main characters do? Why am I supposed to mostly react to the players if it's my job to create all the events?<br/><br/>I mean, I get your point. The book at least tries to say the Storyteller is there to introduce situation and respond to the players. But those contradictory passages don't magically make perfect sense, even after you interpret them.

That could be cool, though.<br/><br/>And yeah, Diablerie: Mexico was really super bad.  I don't own that anymore. I think it may have been the first gaming product I ever got rid of.  What I'm saying is that D:M is part of a super-long history of shitty railroaded modules. If we want to get our hate on for those, I'm all down for that in another thread. But that ISN'T Vampire's fault. It's not even Dragonlance's fault. I have Champions modules from 1980 that have "no matter what the players do..." in it.  It was in the hobby from the very beginning. The Storyteller advice in Vampire said "don't railroad".  Then they made a Vampire module that railroaded everything.<br/><br/>A lot of the contradictions get worked out/clarified over the course of the book, as I pointed out above.  The players control the characters and therefore the plot, but the environment the plot occurs in is in the hands of the Storyteller, as well as inciting incidents that may get the characters to get a plot moving.  The Storyteller also handles the consequences of the character decisions. <br/><br/>Story is mostly consequences of character decisions.  Plot is character decisions and goals. That's not really contradictory.  (It might be wrong, and confusing to someone who came in with other definitions of what those two things were, but not contradictory.)<br/><br/>And "entertain your friends" is straight up defined as service to the story, so that's not contradictory either.<br/><br/>It's not perfect and it stumbles around a bit, and I've pointed out where it does.<br/><br/>But it certainly isn't the Epitome Of Horrible Gaming That Intentionally Hurt People And Harmed The Hobby that many say it is.

I'm willing to forgive some of the organizational problems, and even some of the math issues. I'm even willing to say, yeah, the GM clearly has to give the campaign some firm direction at the outset, and if he doesn't that's his fault and not the game's (even if I kind of suspect the text doesn't make this as clear as it could). Although, I will admit it's tough to have any respect whatsoever for a design that, as you yourself said, actively militates <i>against</i> engaging in a horror-tinged struggle for survival, even if there are other cool things about the game. Still, if I'm reading as generously as possible, spending your CP simply protecting yourself from conflict/harm was commonly an option in games of that era that simply had to be house-ruled away because it was so obviously "playing wrong" in most campaign styles.<br/><br/>Because all of those detail sort of issues can be left to individual play-groups to sort out if the game does, indeed, help them get on the same page about the goal of the game and the role of the players, including the GM. (JackFractal makes a good point that the text was especially bad for newbies, however, who didn't know how to reconcile the contradictions.)<br/><br/>It's the mind-boggling stupidity of the impossible and outright contradictory demands it places on both the GM and the PCs that condemns VtM1E.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395241/#Comment_395241" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T07:35:28+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  7:35AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Jason, you're a champion of the "Everyone plays wrong" school of thought, so I find it interesting that you're promoting such an apparently literalist approach in this thread.</blockquote>\nI do think everyone plays wrong - I'm really trying to stay away from the much more obvious and powerful argument that Vampire must be a successful game text because so many game groups, including complete newbie game groups, had experiences with it that ranged from great to terrible-but-not-harmful with it for just that reason.

Our final project was to build a game as a class. We all pitched game ideas. My friend and I worked really hard on ours, we had a full design document, clearly defined goals for players, and we\u2019d worked out all the rules. It was very clear what we were going for. <br/><br/>Our game wasn\u2019t picked. In fact, none of the clearly defined games were picked. The game that was picked was the one that was the least defined. It was very hazy, the people pitching it had no clear idea of what they wanted to do, just a vague setting. <br/><br/>They were picked, I believe, because their idea was vague enough that it didn't shut down any options. Because it was undefined, people could project their own dreams onto it. A more concrete idea, a clear design, shuts out other ideas. <br/><br/>Dogs in the Vinyard tells a particular kind of story. It is clear in its goals. It says \u201cplay this game to do this one kind of thing\u201d. A lot of modern games do this. By offering a clear viewpoint, by constructing a clear design, they invalidate other play options. Trying to run a dungeon-crawl with Microscope is basically impossible, but you might be able to do it (badly) with Vampire. <br/><br/>Most of the games talked about on this forum take a clear stance on how you should be playing them, and by doing so they also take a clear stance on how you shouldn\u2019t be playing them. <br/><br/>Vampire doesn\u2019t. In its incoherence it allows people to project the kind of game that they want to play onto it. It might not support those games very well, but it doesn\u2019t explicitly forbid them. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395272/#Comment_395272" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T11:12:46+00:00" title="October 29, 2012 11:12AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Vampire doesn\u2019t.

This wasn't the fault of 90s games, though.

I don't think there's a lot of rails in the rulebook or the stuff you've quoted, either, frankly.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nRailroading was not the only way to run scenarios in the '80s.  There were good early examples that could have been followed in the 90's but were not.  Some games took the tac of presenting what wargaming and strategic siNmulations had already done: present a scenario.<br/>That is to say, a situation ripe with tension and drama.  The players make a few crucial decisions and the results play out.  FGU (Daredevils, Bushido, and elsewhere) published wonderful scenarios with colourful maps, interlinked NPCs, and a few agendas.  Players had to make some quick choices and see the results of their actions.  No railroading there, but a problem was dumped on your lap and you had to deal with it then and there.  The scenario packs for Runequest had a similar wide-open quality.  And the ones that die-hard Gloranthaphiles got printed in the 90's kept some of that quality (including contributions by Jonathan Tweet).Tonnes of scenarios waiting to be opened up.  Turning to D&amp;D, good dungeon crawls with thoughtfully prepared encounters, random or prepped, were not railroads.  You had to go in with a good plan, improvise, and maybe still get creamed.  So you learned and got ready for the next bout.<br/><br/>Now, it is a shame that the rules in FGU games really didn't allow full enjoyment of the scenarios from their games.  Neither did Runequest's.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>How to play Vampire: the Masquerade, First Edition - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17450/how-to-play-vampire-the-masquerade-first-edition/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="How to play Vampire: the Masquerade, First Edition - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17450/how-to-play-vampire-the-masquerade-first-edition/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Now, how about procedures?

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back in 1991 when this book came out, I hadn't been exposed to game theory, let alone Forge-style roleplaying game theory. My history with the hobby included D&amp;D, AD&amp;D, James Bond 007, Daredevils, Bushido, and Champions.<br/><br/>Back then, in that moment, I and my gaming buddies had no trouble cracking open Vampire, reading the book, following the procedures of play*, and having some of the most intense, Anne Rice inspired gaming as storytelling any of us had up to that point experienced.<br/><br/>None of this is to say I think VtM is the pinnacle of game design. Much more focused, purpose built games have come out since, and just because it's one of my favorite game engines, I look at The Undying (hack for Apocalypse World) as a great potential coherent inheritor of VtM's asthetic.<br/><br/>All of this in support of a continued critical analysis of the VtM text, the good, the bad, the ugly, and the related discussion. And a big thank you to JDCorley for taking this on.<br/><br/>*And yes, we did was (mostly unconsciously) filter out the incoherence of the text. And, there is a lot of good advice on how to pick and choose what options to set up in a campaign and how to run the rules to produce good play.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395320/#Comment_395320" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T17:46:31+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  5:46PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2012 5:46PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>if you read it and played it the way it said to, it pretty reliably produced great gaming once a couple of bumps got ironed out.</blockquote>\nJD, I'm enjoying your takes on these passages, but c'mon man.  "Reliably"?  I mean, if you were to make the point that Vampire is a toolkit and doesn't <i>need</i> to be reliable, then fair enough.  But just because "unreliable!" can't be assumed as a <i>bad thing</i> doesn't mean it isn't <i>true</i>.<br/><br/>I dunno, maybe your standards are just really, really low because RPGs <i>in general</i> are unreliable.  But I've spoken to more players (and Ron claims to have spoken to many more than that) who were completely unable to get what they thought they'd get from Vampire than from soccer, baseball, basketball, ultimate, chess, Monopoly, and Magic the Gathering <i>combined</i>.  I mean, chess <i>reliably</i> produces chess.  Montsegur 1244 <i>fairly reliably</i> produces a short morality tale in a besieged castle.  Vampire produces... uh... well, whatever you decide to use it for, which makes it about as reliable as freeform.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonLeigh" title="JasonLeigh"><img alt="JasonLeigh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonLeigh">JasonLeigh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395321/#Comment_395321" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T17:58:00+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  5:58PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David<br/><br/>Depends upon the definition of reliably. I kno I'm just representing one group of five, but we reliably got great play out of VtM as a group, over time, by reading the VtM book and following the procedures we found there. So it was reliable fun for one group, over time.<br/><br/>That's not the same, no, as reliably producing great play *across* groups of people. And I'm not a VtM adherent. I haven't played it in years, and wouldn't go back to the storyteller system, unless I got paid to play it. I much prefer post-Forge diaspora games, precisely because they are more focused on a given style of play.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395324/#Comment_395324" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T18:12:03+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  6:12PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call Jason, I may have been misreading JD on that.

Interesting look at what is actually in the book.<br/>I always saw Vampire: the Masquerade as one of the most important works of postmodern vampire fiction. It changed the way Vampire storys are told (in all media) and in that way it's influence can be felt today even by non role-players. So looking into the game for how they told you to tell the stories is a worthy afford.<br/>Also there was great branding of character types in VtM. The Clans all had an identity and seemed like characters that were fun to play. A bit like the playbooks in all the AW systems are aiming for. Also it was a breakdown of Vampire clichees for roleplaying and created a few new ones / cemented them.<br/>All sucesses that could work without the rules or even despite them. Still reasons for the games popularity. And as far as I can see it, it really fit culture at that point in the 90s. It had relevance there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395333/#Comment_395333" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T21:20:23+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  9:20PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm skipping way, WAY ahead to the Storytelling chapter. I think the analysis some have posted earlier calling this a "toolkit" are right on the money. And if you look above at the quotes I've already given you, it's clear that one of the goals, even stated in contradictory ways, is to empower players (including Storyteller) to pursue <i>their interests</i> with the game.  This chapter is also BY FAR the most "railroading-est" of chapters, because as mentioned above, the main thing the Storyteller does other than respond to character action is to establish and iterate situation.  In designing a Chronicle, you don't have any character action to respond to, so you have absolute control not just over content, but theme and tone.\n<blockquote>A Chronicle  has  a  beginning and  an  ending.  It  has  obstacles for  the  characters  to  overcome and  it has  a constant motif.  The Chronicle more  than  likely has  some of the same villains appearing again and again to antagonize the characters. It  is not simply a string of  stories slapped together  - not unless you are willing  to  settle for something mediocre.  A Chronicle must be created with as much patience, creativity and grace as a model plane or an oil painting. <br/><br/>A  typical Chronicle will  last  for  many  years  (player years) because it  is based upon  the  lives of Vampires, who are immortal.  Thus,  it  is  possible for a  single Chronicle  to cover several  hundred  years  in  time. However, because Gehenna is fast approaching, it is likely that your Chronicle will take place over years or decades, not centuries. Several stories may occur within  weeks  of one  another,  but  sometimes  stories will  be separated by years of  down time, which you may describe to the players but not  roleplay  through.  Stories are  the  exciting  but infrequent events that punctuate long years of quieter pursuits. You need to begin designing the Chronicle long before the  players create  their characters.  Hopefully, you  will  have already spent several hours of work, at the minimum,  in deter\xadmining  the substance and texture of the Chronicle you want to run.  Everything  else  depends  on  what  you  come  up  with initially. The sharper your ideas, the better everything else will be  later  on.  It  can  be  time-consuming  to  create  a  Vampire Chronicle, but later on it will save you time when you create the stories. <br/><br/>You have a number of decisions to make as you create the  Chronicle.  First,  you  need  to  decide  the  Setting  of  the Chronicle  - what city is  it set in and what is that city like?  (We recommend Chicago, or another city nearby, since this will be the location of much of  our supplemental material.)  Secondly, you need  to determine what connects  the characters and what their  motivations will be.  Third, the primary antagonists of  the players  need  to  be  delineated.  What  are  their  motivations? Fourth,  a  plan  of the  progression  of  the  Chronicle  should  be constructed, to detail where you want to  take  it.  Lastly, you need to determine the motif of the Chronicle, which describes the  reoccurring  images, subjects, moods and special rules you will include in it. Making these decisions wisely will insure that your Chronicle runs smoothly. </blockquote>\nI know, you all went crazy over the "plan", but whatever, that's not even the most railroadingest part of what's coming, that's a FOOLS GOLD that was taught to you by CLINTON EDWARDS ANYWAY. or somebody, but the key part of this that I found innovative at the time was that, holy shit, I was going to plan for an ENDING to my campaign?!?! WHAT THE HELL PEOPLE you mean this game isn't going to last 50 years while we go from noobs to gods?!?  This game was the first one I was exposed to that really gave me the kind of energy that a game's ending gives. Pretty good stuff.  D&amp;D never dared to give me an <i>ending</i>, not even when I became a god.  (We all coincidentally became gods right around the time I in BECMI was released - you did too - don't lie.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395334/#Comment_395334" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T21:27:49+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  9:27PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And because I know you won't leave me alone until I put it in, here's the "Plan" section:\n<blockquote>You need  to  create  a  plan  for  how  you  want  the Chronicle  to  progress.  Where  should  the  stories  take  the characters and how will the Chronicle eventually end (if ever)?  It  is  a blueprint for  creating not only  the beginning of a good Chronicle, but the entire thing. <br/><br/>The plan details where you want  the Chronicle  to  go and what you eventually want the characters to be doing.  More  than  likely,  the  Chronicle  will  end  up  differently  than  you intended. Indeed, if  it does end up exactly where you  thought it would,  it might mean you aren't providing the players enough opportunity to  exercise their free-will. <br/><br/>The plan is  intended  to be a guide to help you under\xadstand what  you  want  the  Chronicle  to  be - it's a  means of  forcing  yourself to make  it dynamic, with  changes  in  tempo, mood and content. Always  try  to  stage a  great ending  to  the Chronicle. Never  let  it  slowly  decline  into  an  obscure  death.  Will  the Chronicle end with the death of  the characters as part of a heroic sacrifice, or will they somehow manage to become mortal once again? </blockquote>\nThat's it.  It's not much, but the section on what you should expect explicitly says player input is necessary for an eventual ending, don't get too caught up in your plan, so whatever. Really there is not much here, it's not a strong section.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395336/#Comment_395336" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T21:43:48+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  9:43PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HERE is the real railroading section of V:tM, the only one that can possibly exist: the one that exists before the players get to your house.\n<blockquote>The character is  the basis of  the Chronicle, as  it is  for the  sake of the character  that it  is  told  in  the  first  place.  The character is always the focus of  events, and the decisions of  the characters decide  the course of the  plot.  Therefore,  before a Chronicle  begins,  you  must prepare  the  characters.  A  great Chronicle requires equally great characters. <br/><br/>One  thing you must decide before  the Chronicle begins is why the characters are  together  - why they form a Brood. Of course, the players will have a lotto say about  this, perhaps even the primary say, but because you have created the Chronicle, it is up to you to make the characters fit  into it well.  Ask yourself what kind of  relationship the characters have with one another? Why are  they friends?  Why do they work  together? The most important thing to do is make sure that each character in  the group has adequate and sensible enough moti\xadvations to do what you would like  them to do. Do they have some reason for being a part of  the group?  In short, will the characters make sense in  terms of  the Chronicle? <br/><br/>The Prelude is a great way to get characters prepared for the Chronicle. It can explain to them the nature  of  the setting, contacts for them to go to in times of need, and an understanding of what will  be  required  of  them.  Motivations  can  often  be created  and  expanded  during  the  Prelude  as  well,  making  a complete Character out of one  that was paper thin.  Use  the Prelude  to prep your  players,  so  that when the action begins,  they will be ready with  the right sort of character. <br/><br/>Sometimes you may want the characters to be from the same Clan.  You  should generally avoid  this, because players  like  to  have  a choice, but  for  some Chronicle concepts  it can work very well  to  focus  the characters and  forge a  team spirit among  the players. <br/><br/>If nothing else works, you may want all the players to choose  a  personal  history  in  common  and presume  that  their characters  were  friends  before  they  were  transformed  into Vampires. If your  players  are  forever fighting among themselves and have little trust for one  another, then this can be an excellent way  to bring them together. At the very least, they can have been friends during their Neonate period before they were released by their Sire. <br/><br/>Do what you need to do to make the characters work in the context of the Chronicle.  If the players are not cooperative, find ways  to make them  so.  A system of rewards and punish\xadments (experience points, Humanity) can perform wonders on the attitudes of the players. </blockquote>\nThis requires a Storyteller deeply involved in character creation, preludes, making sure that people have the right motivations, and not spend all their time murdering each other, even advising crappy bribes to make people not do this.  The next section actually expands on this greatly (and way more constructively than crappy bribes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395337/#Comment_395337" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T21:51:21+00:00" title="October 29, 2012  9:51PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In comparison to the three paragraph section about planning your Chronicle's events, there's literally <i>six full pages</i> of Chronicle Concepts, each demonstrating options for how to use the Vampire toolkit to play in a different way:<br/><br/>The options presented, in great detail, are:<br/><br/>Gang, Wanderers (including a sub-concept of the Vampire ROCK BAND, yeah, you know you want to play this game right now, right?), Diablerie, Lords of a City, Refugees, Brood Of A Prince, Mortal Politics, The Becoming, A Normal Life, Camarilla, The Quest, Fanatics, The Cult, Patrons, High Society, Historical, Other World<br/><br/>This is where your problem was solved, Eero (back in 1991, wut wut), the one about having made a character that gave no shits about vampire politics.  Because that character would fit great in... (counting) at least 10 of these Campaign Concepts.<br/><br/>Let's say I was your GM and I wanted the character to give a shit about vampire politics.  I would have developed a Campaign Concept like this one:\n<blockquote>Camarilla: The  characters  are heavily involved in Camarilla politics. They are united by an ambition they share or similar views on what should be done.  Perhaps  they could meet at  a Conclave meeting  and  unite  after  discovering  that everyone else opposes  their point of view.  More  than  likely, there  is  some ongoing controversy splitting the Kindred of  the city, perhaps concerning the breaking of  Traditions. More than likely, a Justicar wiIl  arrive to attempt to settle things before the Chronicle comes  to an  end. <br/><br/>The  characters  are  among  the  most  feared  and  re\xadspected Kindred in  the Camarilla.  They are the enforcers who  travel from city  to city, assisting the Prince and the Justicars in maintaining the status quo.  Perhaps created as  the Brood of a powerful Elder, they may actually begin the game with five or more Discipline  points.  If they  ever  have  to  go  into  Sabbat Domain, they will need  it. <br/><br/>Give the characters 25 Freebie points each,  so  that their characters will be capable of combating more powerful Kindred. Teamwork  will  be  essential  regardless.  They  might  have Mentor or Status. They will  travel, but will  likely be based in a single city. <br/><br/>Present  the  players  with  moral  conflicts  like  Duty vs.  Justice.  Do  they discover the  truth or do  they  continue  to <br/>mindlessly serve  their masters? Or  are  their masters right?  Play up the intrigue - the characters should not know what is going on, and should be able  to  trust no one.  Ask yourself what is is going on?  What is  the nature of  this conflict?  Make sure that it is  as real and engaging as you can make it. </blockquote>\nAnd I would have been involved in creating your character and put these questions and plans before you as we created your character together.  Remember, the Storyteller is making the Chronicle, which is the initial situation, <i>including</i>, to a significant degree, the initial positioning of the player characters.  To do this without being involved in character creation is not just impossible but directly against the <i>direction</i> of the book.<br/><br/>Actually these six pages kind of stomp all over that "plan" section too, not just in terms of how much there is, but in terms of what they ask you to actually plan.  Look at the last paragraph there.  You plan conflicts, the characters will have to make choices to address them.  That's their business, and that's the story.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395339/#Comment_395339" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T22:07:37+00:00" title="October 29, 2012 10:07PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2012 10:22PM by JDCorley.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, wanna know what they suggest for characters for the sample campaign? (Gonna go into more detail on the examples throughout the book soon.)\n<blockquote>With only a  few  exceptions,  the  players may choose nearly any sort of  character.  Tell the players before they come up with  the concept for  their characters that they need to make their character fit the "Lords of  the City" concept.  They should feel  responsible  for  Gary,  and  strive  to  keep  it  free  of  the domination of  the Chicago Kindred.  This desire can grow, but the seed should be present from  the very start. <br/><br/>Besides  the  player  characters,  there  are  only  seven other Vampires  in  Gary.  They  include Modius  the  Prince; Allicia, his Neonate; Michael, who lives in a graveyard; Juggler, the Anarch of Gary; Evelyn, his Neonate; Lucian,the Elder who controls  the docks; and Danov, who is a simple wanderer. <br/><br/>The general idea in  this fairly simple Chronicle is to set things up with  the characters, and  then  to  let  them  pursue and create  their  own  goals  and plots. <br/><br/>The best way  to do that is to give each character a unique enemy, an antagonist of some sort.  In the cast of characters section, we have described a number of potential  antagonists,  both  mortal  and Kindred.  Pick  the appropriate one for each character and  then weave them  Into  the Chronicle at  opportune times. You don't want  to have too heavy a hand  though. <br/><br/>Each Prelude will be  private, though that may cause  the players to be distrustful of  each other, and should introduce the players to  the setting.  It will give you a chance to  implant some of the  crucial  elements  of the  Chronicle  into  the  character's persona  and  the  player's  mind,  before  the  Chronicle  even begins.  Because  the  Chronicle  is  to  be  complicated  and intrigue-filled,  it is almost essential that the players are primed to become part of the great "Chicago Game." <br/><br/>All the Sires of  the characters are from Chicago. Lodin has forbidden  the creation of Neonates for  the last 18 years, so the characters' Sires went to Gary to Embrace those who they could not resist  (for one reason or another).  They  have gone against the wishes of their Prince, but  they are difficult  to punish. </blockquote>\nBasically the way it says to start playing Vampire is with a clear overarching situation - an invasion of vampires and vampiric influence from another town that is personally connected to the player characters <i>by killing them</i>, who are the masters of their fuckin' domains and powerful enough to be a serious threat, potentially they are up to a majority of vampires in their town. The players can do whatever they want about the invasion, so long as they start with a motivation not to bend the knee (otherwise there's no conflict and nobody cares about the game.)<br/><br/>This is pretty straight up amazing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395405/#Comment_395405" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T12:14:24+00:00" title="October 30, 2012 12:14PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, look, the toolkit thing doesn't bother me at all.

I picked it up from my brother in the early 90's, who picked it up from running AD&amp;D and Shadowrun modules before I could read. While I do agree with Deliverator that text as written displays quite a few phrases that encourage railroading on behalf of the Storyteller, I don't believe that it was the primary culprit for establishing railroading as the wide-spread dysfunctional monster everyone hisses about today. The text leaves a lot up to interpretation though, and a fledgling Storyteller may very well read this as a greenlight to railroad the shit out of their players at every turn.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395419/#Comment_395419" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T14:15:31+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  2:15PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Railroady or not, many of those modules and approaches were seen as an upgrade from site-to-site tactical missions, whether SR, AD&amp;D, or VtM, or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395425/#Comment_395425" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T14:36:06+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  2:36PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2012 2:40PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, doesn't all the stuff about GM planning conflict with the stuff about letting the players decide where the narrative goes?  <br/><br/>An earlier instruction sounded to me like, "If the player wants to go to the warehouse, then the next scene will be at the warehouse."

But there is effort to minimize that issue in the following way:<br/><br/>1) The Storyteller controls the environment. If they've introduced "the warehouse", then it is presumably something they've introduced for the purpose of advancing their Chronicle Concept, the theme of the game, etc.  So going there is, even if it's not necessarily where ALL the fun and action will be, probably of minimal harm and will probably actually be okay.<br/><br/>2) The Storyteller is deeply involved in character creation, their intial situation, and initial direction.  So it's likely that the players who are playing their characters according to their motivations and drives, created in conjunction with the Chronicle Concept, will be going places and doing things that support that concept.  Random "let's just go over here for no reason" is not likely to happen <i>when you've got a core motivation</i> and the events around you are <i>relevant to that motivation</i>.<br/><br/>So in the sample campaign, if I introduce a warehouse into the game, it will have something to do with the Chicago vampires' invasion in some way, and even if I kind of expect them to be at the cool vampire party, it's not going to be <i>irrelevant</i> if they go somewhere else, and my job is to say what happens as a result of their decision. (People talk shit about them behind their back at the party, and also they discover whatever it was that was at the warehouse when I introduced it, maybe more since all the vampires are at the party? IDK.)<br/><br/>My experiences were that wandering-away happened when people either didn't have any investment in the Chronicle Concept, brought their characters in late so they didn't have that strong initial situation and push, and so on.<br/><br/>Edit: Crossposted with Thark, yes, that is what I am trying to get across.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395447/#Comment_395447" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T15:33:35+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  3:33PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2012 3:37PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thark, I believe that you can solve it.

Similarly with a Vampire game that is trying to support games about refugee wandering fugitives from vampire Nazis, chainsaw-wielding goth rockstars churning their way across Amurka, and people Just Trying To Become Human Again.  Contradiction is fine, because those concepts are contradictory and need different things.  It definitely could have been clearer, of course, but it wasn't unplayable, the contradictions weren't that significant.

Shitting on Vampire is like shitting on the Yankees.  It's their success that makes them a relevant target.  I think most of us on S-G who hate parts of the game want to address those parts because if we could fix them we could more easily get at the awesome in the game, which we agree is there.

One thing I remember that's perhaps of interest, is some of the other adventures, like in the Boston book and the New Orleans book, and the Giovanni Chronicles. I learned how to run good games from Call of Cthulhu adventures, which are really good for educating you in a certain type of mystery game, if you play tons and tons of them. It's the type where you have a dastardly crime, with clues scattered all around it, and the investigators wander around until they collect enough to reach the confrontation at the end, where they all die or go insane. Vampire adventures tended to be structured as a semi-linear series of scenes, though. I never ran them as a straight railroad-through-the-scenes-in-order, but I think this presentation may have contributed to the railroad rep just as much as D:M.<br/><br/>In spite of some inconsistent writing, I think you've made it clear how Mark Rein Dot Hagen intended for the game to be played, Jason. You spend a bunch of time getting on the same page beforehand, then players say what their characters do and the Storyteller says what happens. Sure.<br/><br/>I have to quibble with something else, and you can always address it when you get back to that section or whatever:<br/><br/>You say the powers and backgrounds are bad design in their very nature, which I find a bit odd. I think they're not really balanced all that well, but just having them is bad design? You can't solve ALL your vampiric problems by taking backgrounds, having them gives the ST something to threaten and highlight in play, and they differentiate the PCs and give them reasons to help each other, since they make characters asymmetrical in their needs. Disciplines give PCs ways to get out of trouble, sure, but again, you can't solve all your vampiric problems with them, many powers negate each other, and all of them radically differentiate characters from each other. Without them, Vampire would always be a pixelbitching urban dungeoncrawl of nightly survival. I think there's a lot of bad design INSIDE the disciplines and backgrounds, but as a whole, I don't get it. My actual play doesn't support your assessment and I can't agree with it.

As we all know, (and as we all knew even back then even if we didn't know we knew it), if there's mechanics to do a thing, and no mechanics to undo it, the thing stays done.  So I could burn down your mansion and have some jackass with a cool car steal all your money, but there was no way to get Resources 5 off your sheet (that I remember or have come across yet.)<br/><br/>(Actually the powers are not bad design at all...there I was trying to get across why the Disciplines actually helped players resist railroading to a degree that 1st level D&amp;D characters just couldn't muster.)<br/><br/>And what I was trying to say in my 2 Minute Hate post was that even Backgrounds aren't a problem, it's <br/>1) cheap Backgrounds, <br/>2) only reliably obtainable at character creation, <i>combined with</i><br/>3)  the prioritization of character survival above all other goals (as was outlined in the introductory section) that's problematic.<br/><br/>Even if the Storyteller were to have some means of hitting your Backgrounds, if survival is still your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> goal, then it should still be your top priority.<br/><br/>However, say, if we're using the sample campaign and I say "okay, you all must have some motivation to stop the invasion of Chicago vampires and their influences into your town", that gives us a different-than-survival priority to put at the center of the game, and Backgrounds - even cheap Backgrounds only reliably obtainable at character creation - are not a problem then.  You are absolutely right they are GREAT for character differentiation, niche protection, verisimilitude, escapism, all kinds of good things come from Backgrounds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonLeigh" title="JasonLeigh"><img alt="JasonLeigh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonLeigh">JasonLeigh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395490/#Comment_395490" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T18:46:14+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  6:46PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll chime in and echo that heavy handed GMing at the beginning is critical to a story-esque collaboration during the actual play.

This is apparently caused in part by the game texts themselves, as the attitude seems to rise independently in different places; it's not a difficult leap to speculate that the lack of stridency and procedural absoluteness that e.g. boardgames have for how to play right has a big role here in teaching players to approach all games as extensions of their general craft instead of coming to new games with a fresh palate (as is the norm with the current proge design and play culture).<br/><br/>With this feature of the trad rpg culture in mind I personally would not be surprised if much that is associated with Vampire is actually just the dominant traditional rpg culture as viewed through the Vampire lens; it is perceived as a flagship of '90s game design, so it's no wonder if people transfer their general '90s associations to the game. It's just one game text, and of course it can influence how you play, but if it doesn't actually shake you up and force you to pay attention, and especially if it encompasses multitudes and refuses to take stands, then it's natural that you're going to just play it the same way you play any other games. We never played Vampire around here in the '90s, but the games we did play suffered (or benefited, however you want to view it) of this phenomenon very strongly: mechanics and settings changed, but the game we played was procedurally and creatively the same.<br/><br/>If you accept this characterization of how the rpg culture was at one point and how the game texts supported that culture, then it is entirely consistent to simply not be up in arms against Vampire - it doesn't seem to me to be any more flawed than any other games being published at the time. Personally I even couldn't mobilize against it as I'm not that familiar with the game. It's just one of an endless series of formula designs (not in that its writing and ideas weren't unique, but rather that the systemic design is both standard and vague - the traditional era of rpg design has brought us many incomparable pieces of rpg <i>writing</i>, even with the issues in game design) that the tradition churned out during the '85-'00 era. To measure the game's specific gravity we'd need to get it into the hands of people with no prior chance to develop their own approach to roleplaying, and even that has its own problems due to how Vampire doesn't seem like a beginner's game at all.<br/><br/>All that being said, I'd like to thank Jason for the retrospective. I've decided that I'll have to get the book and check out Vampire myself. Now that I have ascended into a veritable rpg guru (comparing to my teenage self from the '90s, you understand), I'm all too interested in playing even games that I'd have passed on earlier; so what if Vampire requires the GM to be pretty autocratic in places, it might still be an interesting and fresh experience that I'm still lacking! I've admired the setting for a long time anyway, I like the Caine myth and all the stuff it manages to wring out of vampires. Good fiction, and perhaps I could manage to play the game, too, with the aid of latter days rpg wisdom.<br/><br/>Also, a bit about rpg theory: a cohesive vision of the scenario you start play with is a key element of modern narrativist design. Jason's point that this is what Vampire actually advices is interesting in how it emphasizes my above point: when we hear from the many people who've found the game problematic, we're apparently hearing from people who either never applied this structure to their play, or tried and failed due to missing the right player postures and other details. This isn't too peculiar to me as a part of rpg history, as that history is riddled with the pedagogical challenge of rpg writing: how to actually make people play the game correctly without being there yourself to correct their mistakes, and how to do this when simultaneously commercial success requires non-committal writing. Evidently a program like having a consistent campaign arc vision and making players play along with that was too much, too softly communicated to really get through when Vampire was published. Perhaps the exact same game text would be read in a functional manner by more players today than it was at the time, due to how our relationships to game texts and our expectations of play techniques have changed.<br/><br/>(If it seems like I'm not as ultimately interested in game texts as practices, that's just a logical progression in my interests now that I've been wrangling with D&amp;D for five years.

As we all know, (and as we all knew even back then even if we didn't know we knew it), if there's mechanics to do a thing, and no mechanics to undo it, the thing stays done.  So I could burn down your mansion and have some jackass with a cool car steal all your money, but there was no way to get Resources 5 off your sheet (that I remember or have come across yet.)<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>And what I was trying to say in my 2 Minute Hate post was that even Backgrounds aren't a problem, it's <br/>1) cheap Backgrounds, <br/>2) only reliably obtainable at character creation, <i>combined with</i><br/>3)  the prioritization of character survival above all other goals (as was outlined in the introductory section) that's problematic.</blockquote>\nDoesn't that suggest they are only there to set up the starting fiction? If you want more money, status, a larger herd, or a lower generation during play, go get it. Say how you plan to get it and go do that. Likewise, if someone burns down your mansion, you don't have a haven anymore, right? I mean, it's dirty pool to trash somebody's background out of hand without them risking it during play or it becoming a major centrepiece of the drama, but it's all fiction isn't it?<br/>(do you roll your backgrounds? you roll contacts right?)<br/><br/>Does the text not address this at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395506/#Comment_395506" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T21:17:40+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  9:17PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2012 9:19PM by JDCorley.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only mechanical way to increase a Background is through Diablerie, by which you obtain Generation. Everything else is "if your Storyteller says okay, you can increase a Background". I'll give you the text in a bit.  It's a mess.<br/><br/>It also caused a mess around this in my local play culture. <br/><br/>Some people said "You can be filthy rich with no Resources dots due to your great play, bold moves, deals with the devil, whatever.  Backgrounds are just what they say on the label - backgrounds ONLY. Once we start playing, they don't mean shit - your Contacts might feed you bad info, your Allies might work for the other side, IF you don't treat them right." <br/><br/>Some people said all that and added: "AND I actually put and take away dots on your character sheet and if that means you fuck up and I eliminate ALL your backgrounds - your allies are dead, your money was stolen or spent, your status is trashed, some mystical doodad is thinning your blood so your Generation sucks...then you are sitting there with no dots in your Background section and the dude next to you who just started the game gets his 7 just like before. TOO BAD, SUCKER, play better next time."<br/><br/>Some people (including me) said, "What you pay for at character creation, you basically keep. These are core elements of your character.  Physical stuff that you buy with these points are eternal, so are the Merits/Flaws, so whatever happens, it's not legit for me to wreck shit that's the core of your character. You may be alone in your giant mansion stripped bare of all furniture sobbing and screaming about how you were right, why can't the fools see that you were right all along, but you are gonna keep that mansion if you paid for that mansion." (I developed this point of view after the Player's Guide came along with the Merit/Flaw system purchased out of the same pool - this was what basically convinced me that Backgrounds shouldn't be reduced past their initial starting place.)<br/><br/>Other people just said "I can't figure out why there's not just an XP cost associated with these, if you do Appropriate Things and spend XP, you can get everything else on your character sheet, clearly this is just a mistake. Backgrounds should be like everything else - you prioritize it in play and then you spend XP to put it on your sheet where it's yours. Similarly I can take it away, but whatever, it's no big you can buy it back eventually."<br/><br/>Some backgrounds are indeed rolled as bonuses, others provide characters to boss around (allies) or get information from (contacts). Since they are drawn up as NPCs with their own die pools these are actually not bad investments.<br/><br/>I think you've got a good, viable way of interpreting it...maybe it's even in there somewhere and it's my own memory of how I played that's messing it up!

All of the people I was playing with had some background in RPGs. We were used to the idea that players simply made whatever they rolled/created and we'd make it work.<br/><br/>Which does kinda-sorta work for teams of heroic(ish) adventurers of one sort or another, and was pretty much the style of play for everything up to that point which we'd encountered.<br/><br/>Not so good with VtM though. I guess we weren't the only ones doing it. There's a reason that Superheroes with Fangs is a common description for play at the time.<br/><br/>On a side note, and not to grind up too much outdated terminology, but I never thought VtM was supposed to be a Narrativist game. Even before I saw folks using the term, I always assumed this was supposed to be Sim:Genre Emulation, just one stuck with a core of the general style of semi-Gamist/Sim: Physics Engine hybrid rules that were common at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395510/#Comment_395510" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T21:53:39+00:00" title="October 30, 2012  9:53PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Some people said "You can be filthy rich with no Resources dots due to your great play, bold moves, deals with the devil, whatever.

This idea of setting up vampire characters who need to learn to adapt to their condition, and the idea that you'll let players play their characters as people to see what they'll do, it's all strongly narrativist. People with more familiarity tell me that Vampire doesn't function coherently in that regard, though, and I've no reason to disbelieve; games I know from the same era often had very strong rhetoric about literary pretensions while being mechanically completely bare of any sort of creative agenda. I don't usually analyze most pre-Forge games in CA terms exactly because games used to be written so vaguely when it came to creative issues; CA depended much more on how you played than what you played. I'm sure that the Vampire play of the time ranged all over the creative map even where groups found a locally coherent and fun way to play. The games with clear creative agenda were an exception then, not a rule.<br/><br/>If we were to nitpick the agenda incoherence of the Vampire text, it wouldn't be difficult to point out creative imprimaturs that go any which way in there. I'm personally stricken by the strong gamist wibe in some of Jason's quotes: the game seems to instruct the players to consider the vampire life as a battleground where their job is to ensure that their characters end up as winners. Based on reading some later WW games (primarily Exalted) I'm inclined to think that this is just a bare design mistake; the writer attempts to motivate and orient players by talking tough game, perhaps, all without realizing how this could potentially mess with the Storyteller's attempts at building a sensitive and thematically aware group activity. Or maybe he simply doesn't have verbiage for any other attitudes that players might bring to a game, I've seen that too. Either way, the player and GM instructions have often been very much at odds in WW games, with players being encouraged to game the system and GMs encouraged to focus on prepping storylines (as opposed to challenges, which one would expect if the game was looking to intentionally go gamist). And that's just the gamist/narrativist issue, there's clearly a lot of simulationist rhetoric in there, too.<br/><br/>But as said, I at least am not one to consider it an immense sin on the part of an individual game book that it's vague and all over the place when the book hails from 20 years back; it was a different time. I've been known to say some very strict things to people who consider publishing this type of game text <i>now</i>, but we're living a different time with different expectations. If a designer writes or a company publishes a '90s style trad game today, that's clearly a creative or commercial choice and not just a piece of history we're looking at in hindsight. (And to be clear, it's a choice that disinterests me personally, and I don't usually bother with trad games, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it if you like this type of game writing.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395512/#Comment_395512" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-30T22:02:07+00:00" title="October 30, 2012 10:02PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 30, 2012 10:10PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, shit, y'all just reminded me of one of my least favorite Vampire experiences.

Anyone that looked at Vampire and thought it would give us what-we-now-think-of-as-narrativism was simply straight drunk.  Morality in Vampire stories is just part of the genre, to be kicked around and celebrated with all the verve, and depth, of lace cuffs and silver bullets with crosses carved in them. It is part of the scenery, to be chewed. You can't really have horror without some kind of moral strictures/world. Vampire posits a completely arbitrary and Victorian moral world and then says "do what you want - either try to claw your way back to humanity/Golconda, or descend into madness, or stick it out with politics, whatever, lol"  There really isn't anything in it that says you, the player, will be making moral statements regarding Egri-premises when you play - Storytellers bring themes and premises to the table, but in the normal sense of those words, not the highly specialized Egri sense of those words. <br/><br/>Because narrativism is defined so narrowly (it is a useless concept, NO WAIT THIS ISNT THAT THREAD), you really are never, ever going to "luck into it", unless someone just really likes your game and puts it in the Narrativism essay for no reason, like Castle Falkenstein?  And certainly not in a game that is simultaneously trying to let you be rowdy rock and roll antiheroes and struggling blood addicts trying to keep from losing their family.<br/><br/>(Interestingly, the "get back to being human" part was de-emphasized DRASTICALLY in 2nd Edition and Revised. Like, to the point where I don't remember if it got more than a paragraph in either book, whereas it's all over 1st and has a whole Chronicle Concept based around it.)<br/><br/>Source material is layered throughout with extensive quotes from songs, books, poetry (haha) at the beginning of chapters and sections. But any Anne Rice fan will instantly recognize the crap in Vampire 1ed, with delight (it's actually a lot more well-thought-out than Rice's world, that is to say, not well thought out at all.)  Other than these references, the text really tries to hit you with mood rather than with specific allegories or parallels.<br/><br/>Anyway, you can buy Vampire: Bloodlines for $5 on Steam right now, go drink blood from rats and remember, these are the days of cellphone cameras. Fuckups ain't tolerated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager

Like on the one side, starting a chronicle with one PC's 3-dot haven burning down, or having their contacts only tell them lies really sucks from a player perspective. But if you make an ally a central character and the vampire brings them along on a meet and can't prevent them from getting killed? That's their fault. Also, that's drama. On the opposite end of bad play, though, if the ST kept that ally inviolate no matter what, somebody <del>would</del> okay <i>might</i> just buy a bunch of allies and wear them like bullet-proof vests.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, buying backgrounds with xp is kinda cool, just like buying a gang in AW is cool, but if you can't, there's more motivation to pursue stuff in the fiction. Again, as long as your ST isn't a dick about taking your stuff away and is concerned with making your choices matter.<br/><br/>But that's "functional play" stuff and not "what does the text say" stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395531/#Comment_395531" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T00:44:19+00:00" title="October 31, 2012 12:44AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And social conflict is probably the number 1 hotbed of the above disjunction.</blockquote>\nTrue, that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395556/#Comment_395556" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T07:12:43+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  7:12AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Based on JD's snippets, my impression is that the book acknowledges the virtues of both approaches, but doesn't explicitly say what to do in cases where they conflict, beyond perhaps "Storyteller's judgment call."

When we played Vampire (more-so Hunter) in the 90's, Backgrounds weren't truly stagnant, but the ST rarely touched them - mostly because we didn't think to. It would obviously be a dick move to take away Background points - unless the player chose to risk those background elements during play in exchange for a payoff. So maybe a character uses one of their allies as bait for a nasty werewolf or something. They're putting their background at risk so they don't have to put themselves at risk. I wouldn't feel bad on either side of the table if the bait got creamed and the Background point was lost.

FUCK IT let's do this. I'm going to continue on with the Storyteller instructions first, because really these are pretty good.<br/><br/>Here's some Do's and Don'ts from that chapter:\n<blockquote>\u2022 Keep all  the characters in mind . Provide something for  everyone  to  do. no matter what  the  Scene.  Even  if one Character  is  the one on whom  everything  rests. cut off your roleplaying with that player after a bit and do something with the other players.  It may not make any difference to  the plot but it will  let everyone have some fun, keep  them  from  being bored, and will make them a part of the Scene. Let  every player have  an  equal  chance  to  do  something, to  take  an  action  or interact with one of your characters. Though you may naturally give more time to the more creative and inventive roleplayers in your group, never  ignore someone else. <br/><br/>\u2022 Go beyond  the  rules.  The  rules  are  for  keeping Characters in  line.  If your imagination is superior to  the rules, then go beyond the  rules.  Especially for non-player Vampire powers, you should let your imagination roam free.  There are Werewolves and Wizards and even Ghosts in  this world, yet in this game they are not carefully detailed.  You'll have to make up  their  powers  on  your  own.  You  may  make  them  as mysterious and enigmatic as you desire. Future products  in the Storyteller\u2122  series will detail these beings more completely. <br/><br/>\u2022 Encourage  the  players  to  roleplay  among  them\xadselves.  You want to see real and vivid interaction between the players.  If  they don't roleplay  unless  they're  talking  to  you, you know something is wrong. <br/><br/>\u2022 Take Breaks.  Sometimes you're going  to  need  to take a break.  To stand back from  the action and take a look at where  the  story  is going and where it's at. At such  times, simply <br/>stand back  from  the  table and  take a short walk, or open  this book  and  pretend  you  are  reading.  Don't feel  embarrassed about this; everyone needs these rests. The players get  them all <br/>the  time.  but  the  Storyteller almost  never does.  It's almost impossible  to  sustain  a  high  level  of dynamic  storytelling without breaks.  A good idea is  to start the players roleplaying with one another before you  rest, since  this  ensures  that they aren't bored while you're not involved. <br/><br/>\u2022 Encourage Player Input.  Don't run  the game with\xadout being  aware  of what  your  players  like  and  don't  like. Balance the desire of the players  to achieve  the objectives of their  characters  with  their  desire  to  roleplay  - let  them accomplish their goals without breaking character. </blockquote>\nAll pretty great except for 'go beyond the rules', which makes more sense when you interpret it to mean that the rules are there to keep the characters in line with each other and other vampires.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395785/#Comment_395785" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T18:20:21+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  6:20PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are the Don'ts:\n<blockquote>The following are things which you should never do: <br/><br/>\u2022 Don't  take away the characters' free will. Players are invariably protecti ve of what they consider  to be the free will of their characters.  They want  real choices,  and  the  freedom  to choose their characters' actions.  While they need to feel  that if they do something stupid they will be punished, you don't want them  to  feel  that,  if they  think  of something  smart,  you  will punish  them, because it wasn't what you had anticipated. <br/><br/>\u2022 Don't  force the characters into a pre-determined plot. In Vampire. more so than in other  games. the characters need  to be  self-motivated.  You  cannot  simply  stick  them  into  your  story.  You  have  to  weave  the  story  around  them  and  let  them become involved in  it at their own pace. Often this means you must create the story as you go. making up each Scene and doing a  great  deal  of  impromptu  roleplaying.  It  is  difficult.  but fulfilling. <br/><br/>\u2022 Don't let luck rule the plot. Characters should get to win on the basis of their own  skill and ingenuity, not on unrelated dice  rolls.  Try  to  give  the  players  every  chance  to  have  the  experience and Abilities of  their characters make the difference. Automatic  successes are  an  excellent way  to  emphasize how important their ratings are. <br/><br/>\u2022 Don't  cater  to  stereotypes.  Though  you  will  use stereotypes regularly. you should always try  to  twist or change them.  Stereotypes are excellent tools  for  the Storyteller, since they allow you  to  quickly get across a character or a situation. Put a stereotype into a story, play it like a stereotype for most of the story (outraging  the players  in the process), and then. near  the conclusion, suddenly flip everything upside down by breaking apart the stereotype.  As an extreme example,  the evil snarling villain can tum out to be a simple-minded Nosferatu as terrified of  the characters as they are of him.  It can be very effective and pleasantly educational. <br/><br/>\u2022 Don't  ignore the characters' Traits.  It  is important to be  be  aware  of the  characters'  Traits,  especially  those  flaws which the players so often often "forget" such as Derangements. Some Traits  that you are not aware of can sometimes become relevan  tto the  story  and make your planed resolution inconsistent or unrealistic.  It is vital you have a good grasp of who and what <br/>the characters are. <br/><br/>For instance. you might spring a trap on the characters, roll the damage dice, and start describing wounds, only to have one of  the players say, "My character has Premonitions,  I get to roll to  see  if he  sensed danger."  Even  if he misses  the roll,  it ruins the momentum you had established and damages the story that you were weaving.  Look over  the characters before the game and make notes of things you should remember. </blockquote>\nI include that last example because I think it's very instructive. You mustn't make the characters abilities useless - indeed, you MUST ruin your momentum and damage your story if you negligently do it, according to these principles - so don't be negligent and pay attention to character capability, make those the lynchpins of the action.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395802/#Comment_395802" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T20:13:14+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  8:13PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are interesting!<br/><br/>They remind me a lot of the Principals section in Apocalypse World.

It doesn't mean that, but I could seem my fifteen-year-old self getting confused by that. \n<blockquote>Don't force the characters into a pre-determined plot. In Vampire. more so than in other games. the characters need to be self-motivated. You cannot simply stick them into your story.

Before it was suggesting that you should plan out almost everything before-hand, and ensure that your players did not create characters that would be disruptive to your carefully prepared schemes. Now it's suggesting that you play reactively.<br/><br/>This is the kind of mutually contradictory advice that really messed with my head when I tried to play these when I was in high-school. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395809/#Comment_395809" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T21:04:13+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  9:04PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so it's not that contradictory.

Because you as the GM have answers to these questions. You don't know what will happen if the PCs manage to trap the leader of the Sabbat in a locked room doused in gasoline and light it on fire. You know who liked them, you know who hated them, and you know how the PCs will be viewed.<br/><br/>I love City of the Damned: New Orleans for Requiem because it's a great example of all of this. Everybody links to the Prince of the city in some way, and the twist is the Prince is about to be taken out of the picture no matter what very soon. So everybody wants to put the next Prince on the throne, and you also know how everybody fits together.

Also, I think it's suggesting that you plan theme, tone, and NPCs during character creation, and then how you introduce it to the characters, who are created specifically to engage with the the theme and tone, is based on PC actions. The books doesn't seem to distinguish between "stuff you prep" and "how you introduce situation to the players," calling it all "story."\n<blockquote>All pretty great except for 'go beyond the rules', which makes more sense when you interpret it to mean that the rules are there to keep the characters in line with each other and other vampires.</blockquote>\nThat part looks to me like it just means that PCs only get to choose from the skills and disciplines listed in the book, the NPCs can have whatever powers the Storyteller wants.

Things I didn't like were, I think, more related to the scenarios.<br/><br/>There's one, I think Milwaukee by Night? It says, at least twice, something on the order of (not a direct quote) "It's bad to take away player agency and bad to say the PCs are captured no matter what. But, sometimes, it's absolutely necessary, like right here in this scenario..."<br/><br/>Bullshit. It is not necessary.<br/><br/>And I got so sick of (again, not a direct quote or anything remotely resembling one) "Okay, so your players have paid dots for Haven and Auspex and the like, and should be able to spot anyone following them and keep their havens secret. Because, really, this is, you know, like, a matter of unlife and death. But, despite that, No Matter What, the enemy of the scenario has totally located and trashed all of their havens, and they never saw him coming."<br/><br/>Okay. And, then the PC must do X and go to Y location where Z will happen, and I'm playing why? Just write your novel and send it to me.<br/><br/>No, Vampire was not the only offender. Don't get me started on Tribe 8. But, no, this was not the only way to write a scenario, even in the 1990s. In the 1990s, I was running Call of Cthulhu scenarios, many of which were excellent when it came to not saying "No Matter What". I presume there were other games with other scenarios that avoided "And here's what will happen, no matter what those pesky PCs try to do." Call of Cthulhu is just the one I fell in love with.<br/><br/>I really got ticked with the Giovanni Chronicles. I'm not just talking the usual railroading, though that's there in spades. In the second one, No Matter What, someone they're likely trying to protect will be killed, giving himself up if necessary to keep the PCs from protecting him. But, what really annoyed me? In the first three, the PCs were basically pawns. Same PCs, and by the time of the fourth one, they would have been really powerful. So, there's payoff for playing through all of this, right? Wrong! Part four explains that the PCs are too powerful to play, so the players are now playing far weaker characters, pawns once more. Bait and switch.<br/><br/>The game rules themselves? I read them, winced at the ones I didn't like, and ignored the stuff I thought was ridiculous. Friends did likewise, resulting in a game we all enjoyed. But, I do not and never have accepted "Well, just ignore what you don't like and add anything you think is missing" as proof that a game is not flawed.<br/><br/>It was an important game, and it taught me some useful tricks. I think it's where I learned the concept of a relationship map and got it so ingrained that Ron Edwards and I had several rounds of "But, I didn't make a relationship map" / "Yes, Lisa, you totally did -- now go run your game already".<br/><br/>And meanwhile, I ignored some stuff so hard that when Mike Holmes told me about the GM -- excuse me, Storyteller -- who did a four hour prelude where Mike had no agency whatsoever, my first mental reaction was, "Oh, you poor guys! You actually believed that crap and tried to do it!" I mean, they were following one perfectly valid interpretation of the Prelude rules: Do it one on one if possible. Don't give the player much choice.<br/><br/>And I think that's a lot of it, communication issues. A four hour Prelude doesn't need to suck.<br/><br/>There's something to the theory that Vampire had a strong effect because of the mess it was. And, it was a language that was spoken nationwide. When I was in line for registration for the San Francisco WorldCon, the people in front of me were talking about the Tremere, and I knew whereof they spoke. One gets that with D&amp;D and World of Darkness. What else is that big these days? (I'm not sure World of Darkness currently is.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395819/#Comment_395819" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T22:38:01+00:00" title="November  1, 2012 10:38PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 10:38PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In the 1990s, I was running Call of Cthulhu scenarios, many of which were excellent when it came to not saying "No Matter What".

Perhaps if I'd been told that there would be one, I'd have come back for a second session. But Lisa has the details right, it was a full session where I had literally zero player power. I would be asked, questions that implied that I could do other than what the Storyteller wanted (also named Mike, as it happens). Like "Do you go along?" But if I answered, "I try to run" I was told, "You try, but you simply can't. You follow him against your will." <br/><br/>I suppose even the attempt to go against the GM's plot is a form of interaction, a statement about my character's character. But even those were far and few between. As I told Lisa, mostly I remember the GM telling me about details like how red the velvet curtains were, now that I could truly see them with my newly vampire eyes. <br/><br/>And lest you think that this was just a prima donna GM, he even talked about how "advanced" this form of play was, Storytelling, and how evolved it all was from earlier sorts of play. He was a true believer, a convert to the cause. <br/><br/>And... yeah, it was a leap forward in thinking in terms of the notion that play could be about things dramatic. It WAS about very dramatic stuff. It just wasn't participatory. At least not in this case. <br/><br/>Note, too, that this was not the only time that I had this happen. I tried it again with another GM, and got a very similar vibe. Lots of the stuff that Lisa is talking about, actually. "Sure, your vampire is really cool... but he sucks compared to all the other ones." That was the paradigm in every single game I played. If the players had cool characters, the GM (excuse me, Storyteller) had much cooler characters, and it was his job to make sure you knew how cool they were. I believe that this must have been encoded in some of the sample early scenarios, and it stuck. Or that sure seemed to be the case. In any case, the vastly more powerful elders meant that the GM got to have his plot, and the players were happily railroaded along. Or else.<br/><br/>Every. Single. Game. I never played one functional (read fun) game of VtM. Even when we used GURPs. <br/><br/>Your milage will vary, I'm sure. But to say that the texts didn't cause this sort of play seems... well just wrong. It might not have in every case, but it did in so many.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395821/#Comment_395821" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T23:02:18+00:00" title="November  1, 2012 11:02PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 11:02PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe it was a problem that the appeal the book pitched was largely the appeal of being a <i>player</i>, but the person who bought the book usually wound up as <i>Storyteller</i>?

I often cite "At the Mountains of Madness" as the worst example of this, as it's basically a 400 page script for the players to follow. It actually says stuff like "When the players give chase..." and has advice in one scene on how to use a magician's force to ensure that a scene comes out like it's supposed to. <br/><br/>But even the less horrific ones suffer from the problem that you can't possibly get through them unless the GM cheats. At some point the players will all fail some roll, and that's the end of the adventure, unless the GM "cheats" somehow to keep it alive.

I believe it was in Masks of Nyarlathotep in which the first part of the scenario was to climb up a wall of collapsing glacial ice, to get details of something carved in a rock (which, due to the collapse of the ice had to be inspected immediately, or be lost to the murky depths underneath permanently. I recall two thirds of the party dying there, due to bad rolls. First scene. We decided to reboot the scenario, and just do it over. Only one PC died in this case, but apparently that was enough. Between the rebooting and dying, nobody was interested in continuing to play the scenario. Just didn't seem right. <br/><br/>Note that this was what happened if you didn't "fudge" and figure out some way to have the PCs survive. My GM, Jim, was a stickler for playing by the rules (no, not a "killer GM" just the most honest person anyone has ever met). To whit, in another scenario run by Jim, my friend Dave had his character die by having his head blown off by fumbling a roll with fishing with dynamite. In yet another scenario, Dave's character died falling off a ladder. Ooooh... scary mythos-y stuff there. After these events Dave swore never to play the game again, and never returned. In playing one of the classic haunted house scenarios, the players were expected from the clues to figure out that it was not the ebony mantlepiece that was involved in a dream they were having, but that it was the oak mantlepiece that was involved, due to figuring out that the shadowy figures in the dream were druids. We simply didn't figure that out as players. A girl (oh so cute, as I recall) who was new to RPGs swore off playing them forever, because the scenario just ended with us walking away unable to figure it out. <br/><br/>I'm not making this stuff up. I've played most of the published scenarios, at least through the first scene. I've read them all since then. Yes, it's possible to work around these issues. But they came up in every single scenario that I played of CoC. Note that when I went and played with the Rogue Cthulu folks at Origins or similar groups at GenCon, they figured out good ways around these issues. The plots were substantially railroaded, but at least you were guaranteed to get to the scary stuff, and likely have your character killed. This was another interesting functional part of the con scenarios for CoC... you could have your character act "appropriately stupid" (to quote the RPG "It Came From the Late, Late, Late Show"), and die, and feel that you'd added to the game. Instead of having your character die from something random in the scenario that you were trying hard to "win", and feeling really, really dumb about it. <br/><br/>CoC scenario design has always had these problems. Yes, some GMs have tricks for getting around them. A typical one is using the magician's force for library use die rolls. "Oh, you missed the roll? Then you only find these few meagre clues." Or, "Oh, you made the roll? You find this bonanza of clues after a really hard dig." Either way giving them the same information. Or, even better, inventing a new and harder or riskier way to get the information. Bad methods included having NPCs walk up and tell you the clue you missed. Some GMs were better than others at this. <br/><br/>In any case, the point is the same. What this did, for GMs like myself, was to teach us to use illusionism to ensure that the scenario got played out. Or, in the case of my buddy Jim, it meant losing players in short order because the game wasn't fun. Yeah, I'm sure that somewhere there's a group of masochists who love NOT being able to figure out mysteries (or, OK, the reward of being successful when they do), and really love it when their characters die pointlessly. But I personally haven't met these folks. Nor can I stand personally being a GM for such a game. <br/><br/>The Gumshoe system, while not exactly to my taste in other ways, is precisely a fix of these problems. And in that respect it does it's job well. Robin Laws would not have created this system had he not seen the same issues in CoC play. He's said this explicitly, and you can probably find it online somewhere.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395866/#Comment_395866" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T06:47:13+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  6:47AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Double posting...<br/><br/>In case anyone reading doesn't know what "Illusionism" means, it is a GMing style that intends to leave the players feeling that they have actual agency in the outcome of a scenario, when in fact the GM is railroading the scenario to a pre-planned conclusion. Another common technique is termed "all roads lead to Rome" where at the fork in the road, it doesn't matter which way the players decide to go, the GM decides that what he needs to be there for the scenario to progress as planned is at the one selected. <br/><br/>The problem with illusionism is that the players know you're doing it when you're doing it. Oh maybe not on X roll, or Y decision. But over time they'll figure it out. Things just work out too conveniently. If things were really "random" you'd end up with results like my friend Jim's GMing. Players aren't dumb, they're on to an illusionist GM almost immediately. Some players just go along with this. But for those who understand that they don't have actual agency, and who really want it, this can really kill their fun. <br/><br/>Cost me two decades of time running bad games, and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. Surely I could figure out how to ensure that a scenario would get to it's end, and yet allow the players to be creating the story at the same time? I mean, after all, the book said I could do it... Illusionism is the best I - or anyone I met during the 80s and 90s - could do.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395867/#Comment_395867" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T06:52:53+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  6:52AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We should have an entire thread on how CoC works successfully.

But I don't think I have. What I'm saying is that, between the potentially confusing parts of the game texts, and the not-at-all-confusing results of actual play of the scenarios presented, you get what you got at the time. No, it's not just the game texts themselves... those just open the door. It's the entire product. People learn to play games from the scenarios, and you have to include that as part of the product that created the phenomenon. <br/><br/>Had they not produced the scenarios? Would the text have produced the same results? Well who cares? That's contrary to fact, conditional to error. The point is that it created a culture of play that did these things, as a result of not only these texts, but coming out of a D&amp;D culture, and other facets... I could go on and on as to the reasons. <br/><br/>Does that mean we can use the same rhetoric today, and get away with it? Well, it's possible. But why would you? There's much better rhetoric to steal from today. What, we're such traditionalists that we have to copy from these old texts? Find a new way. <br/><br/>In any case, nobody in these parts is being harmed by these texts nowadays, so I'm not particularly worried about them. But the culture of play of which I speak is still alive and well. And I avoid it like the plague.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395871/#Comment_395871" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T07:04:52+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  7:04AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not entirely sure that's really that contradictory.

Most of the White Wolf books are collaborations.

Consider the following:<br/><br/>"You are gonna make Vampire Vigilantes...you don't necessarily have the illusion that you will get drugs off the streets, but your goal is to create a sort of drug-free hunting zone where you can sink your teeth into people and not really have to worry that they popped a ton of shrooms or whatever. If the opportunity for more power comes along, you might or might not take it, think about where you are with respect to your goal when it comes up."<br/><br/>(I plan for what will happen if they don't take it, because I've told them that's okay.)<br/><br/>"You are gonna make Vampire Vigilantes...the route to power in other areas is blocked so you are gonna make yourselves the fucking Kingpins. You see the street as the only ecology where you can establish a power base. You are opportunistic motherfuckers."<br/><br/>(The characters are now overwhelmingly likely to take other opportunities to gain power, though likely to flavor it in their own way, which is great. BTW, this is almost exactly what the Gang Chronicle Concept is in the book. The Storyteller advice mentions what happens if they surprise you and don't go for it: you take a break, think it over, then roll with it.)<br/><br/>"You are gonna make Vampire Vigilantes. You have your own reasons for that, which we can go into later. But the number of vampires in town is so small that if the five of you wanted to you could easily push out anyone you wanted. There just aren't a ton of people around to get done what needs to get done. Just that when the game starts, you're not looking in that direction (otherwise we'd already be there and you all would be running things.)"<br/><br/>(This is basically the setup in the sample Chronicle in the book. There are only 7 non-PC vampires in Gary. An assassination/power void/job that's not getting done because the PCs aren't stepping up becomes a really interesting plot development instead of the end of my story.)<br/><br/>See how Chronicle planning - in conjunction with player cooperation - prevents what JF identified as a story vs. plot problem?  That's not a story vs. plot problem, that's a Chronicle planning/communication problem.  And also note two of the sample setups actually do address this specific example!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395896/#Comment_395896" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T08:35:18+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  8:35AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What?<br/><br/>How can you improve on a text without considering it?

I can write better myself. <br/><br/>For instance, with regard for the parts quoted most recently about the GM creating his chronicle, and then the players getting to take an active part in moving it forward, one could merely state in addition to the first part about creating a chronicle that one ought not expect it to play out as one may have planned it. That it's a living framework that will necessarily change. Maybe even give tips on how to create such stuff in more provisional fashion, so that you might be less disappointed if/when things don't go the way your planning thought it might. <br/><br/>Just as an example. But doing things better first requires that we point out what it is that could be done better.

You can't write a text that better expresses the intentions of Vampire's authors unless you understand what those intentions were. D&amp;D is a different game, so how do you define it's texts as better? Because they explain the intent of the authors better? Even if they do, how does that help someone trying to write a different game than D&amp;D, say specifically someone trying to write a game explaining how they played when they played Vampire and it worked? These are some of the questions that come to mind from reading your words. "Better" at what?\n<blockquote>For instance, with regard for the parts quoted most recently about the GM creating his chronicle, and then the players getting to take an active part in moving it forward, one could merely state in addition to the first part about creating a chronicle that one ought not expect it to play out as one may have planned it.</blockquote>\nIt did say that though, didn't it? Didn't Jason quote that part? Also, if that's not the intention of the game designer, then wouldn't it be a bad idea to put that in? Or does this just make the text better, <i>for you</i>?<br/><br/>I mean, I'm interested in Jason's explanation of the text because it shows a semi-consistent usage of certain terms in a certain way without clear definitions that I think are confusing to many people. If we look at it and maybe see what the author(s) were intending, and where they went wrong in communicating that to the audience, then we can see how to avoid those same pitfalls by understanding the path from intent to word to interpretation. If we just look at the path from text to interpretation by the reader, what are you supposed to do with that when you sit down to write? That seems like incomplete information to me. If you don't know the intentions behind the words, how do you separate the parts that were interpreted correctly from the parts that weren't?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395904/#Comment_395904" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T09:23:29+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  9:23AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Which isn't to say I'm opposed to concrete examples of making a text better.

It doesn't, really.  It just says "storytelling is awesome, you are gonna love this game".  It appeals constantly not to theories of drama like Egri, Aristotle or even Syd Field, but to psychotically overblown purple-prose novelist and general trash-purveyor Anne Rice (this is not a criticism of Anne Rice, read all Anne Rice novels, they are hilarious.)  Their examples of play are moody violence, not DIEP INTRASPECTION.  It just never promised what you think it promised. Except maybe on the back cover copy, I guess? I haven't looked at that yet.\n<blockquote> That maybe made it worse, as in, more harmful to local play cultures, than many other games of the time.</blockquote>\nNah, it didn't hurt anyone.<br/><br/>So here is my list of things still to do:<br/><br/>* Finish Storytelling Chapter<br/>* Examples of Play<br/>* Inspirations (? Maybe)<br/><br/>Then maybe talk about improvements we would make today?

actually been swayed by rereading the text.  Everyone else is just seeing exactly what they originally saw, whether that be awesomeness or incoherence.</blockquote>\nWell it's because I didn't have much of an opinion to begin with. I've just about as much to do with Vampire as I do with something like Harn; I know what it is, have read a good deal about it, but have never even read through a full rulebook. I'm sure that if I had gotten into Vampire like so many people here, then I would also have a more personal opinion on what and how it is. Heck, <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>, there's a game I have opinions and experienced about, and they mainly mirror Mike's.<br/><br/>An important nuance here is that Jason and Mike and perhaps some other people, too, are having a discussion that started a long time ago. They're essentially fighting the last war: in the early '00s it was an important point of the Forge message that there is something <i>wrong</i> with traditional game design. Disputations change with context, and the context of the time was such that phrasing the things people at the Forge wanted meant largely refuting what had gone before.<br/><br/>In comparison it seems to me that today we can talk about things in a more neutral manner: I don't think that anybody's opinions have changed any (I still think the same about trad games, for example), but the conclusions and framing of those thoughts is more retrospective now that the Forge movement has largely achieved its aims. We can look at Vampire and say just about what Jason is saying: it's written as the games of its time usually were, apparently the author had a functional play group, the text tries to depict the method but could use some improvements. In practice people read whatever they wanted into it, thanks to the strongly totalizing rpg understanding ("one true way", and everybody had their own) of the time.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that I read what Mike says and what Jason says, and I don't really disagree with either. They're seeing the game in different lights because they've experienced it in different gaming contexts. It's just the same with me and Call of Cthulhu: we were essentially a cargo cult around here when I learned roleplaying, and the game text combined with our reading of it failed to build us up into a functional CoC group. I'm not wrong when I say that the game was clearly much too vaguely written for us, but then neither probably is Johnstone - I'm sure that his group found a functional way to use that same rules text, which then resulted in functional play.<br/><br/>Most significantly, I find it a meaningless matter of emphasis whether we say that "Vampire was awfully written and led many astray" or "Vampire worked well for many people". Both of those can be true at the same time. The more interesting question is whether there is something to salvage in the game's teachings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395945/#Comment_395945" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T15:17:18+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  3:17PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2012 3:19PM by Captain_Thark.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, JDCorely's writing persuaded me to like Vampire in other threads. Other posters also convinced me that Trad games could be cool. And The Burning Wheel and Apocalypse World gave me the mental tools I needed to run trad games in a fun way, since The Burning Wheel defies simple categorization and Apocalypse World is the best damn trad-designed post-apocalyptic game ever!<br/><br/>So I am a convert, I just converted before getting here.<br/><br/>Also: Vampire the Masqurade: Bloodlines does a really good job selling Vampire itself. It's all backstaby politics and subterfuge with awesome 90s subculture monsters, not mopey introspective Artistic Important Commentary on the Human Condition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395970/#Comment_395970" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T19:38:35+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  7:38PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2012 7:38PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Mike's observations about the culture into which Vampire arrived make a strong case for why better wording was vital.  I mean, we all agree that better wording would have been <i>nice</i>.  But in a world of railroady CoC GMs, your wording can't just augment their existing habits with a few pointers here and there; you need to actively <i>combat</i> their bad habits.  Why?  Because these bad habits could ruin their game, and the writers of Vampire should have known that.  I mean, the White Wolf guys did play RPGs in the '80s too, right?<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm setting the bar too high, and CoC was in fact the standard White Wolf was aiming for.  Both CoC and Vampire seem to have similar histories of fervent fandom, much awesome play, much awful play, some amazing modules, and some awful modules.  If Rein-Hagen was in one of the CoC groups that had an awesome time, maybe he didn't think more was needed.  I dunno, still seems like shitty market research at the least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395971/#Comment_395971" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T19:45:08+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  7:45PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2012 7:46PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>we were essentially a cargo cult around here when I learned roleplaying, and the game text combined with our reading of it failed to build us up into a functional CoC group.</blockquote>\nThat is totally worth breaking out into its own thread-- I'm pretty curious about how many people started playing RPGs by learning from someone else already initiated, and how many learned by basically just picking up this wacky-looking book and talking their pals into trying it, and what effect that had on their opinions and techniques.

This, coupled with patient repeating of your message over and over will then cause people to seriously examine their habits, causing a breakthrough in awareness: instead of just unthinkingly applying their gaming habits to new games they'll start to introspect and intentionally play differently and hey presto, suddenly it is again enough to just say things in the game text because people are in the habit of reading them seriously and doing as they say.<br/><br/>Admittedly the Internet wasn't very big in '91, so in practice that would be a bit much to ask of the past.

But, well, take your favorite instructional game text, the one that's clearest and hardest to inadvertently screw up, and compare Vampire to that.  I'm sure you'll find plenty of paths for improvement.<br/><br/>In the abstract, I really couldn't argue with "the game literally says don't railroad and sets up mechanics to help stop railroading".  As you describe it, yeah, it sounds sufficient.  But then there are the confusing bits in the text that make anti-railroading less clear, and character Disciplines and Backgrounds don't <i>actually</i> make the GM play in any particular style, and somewhere at the end of all this you have folks with Mike's experiences.<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, I'd suggest:<br/>1) <b>Highlight it.</b>  Don't just mention "don't railroad" in the middle of 10 paragraphs of advice.  Present the points up front, in their own section.<br/>2) Don't just advise/demand it; <b>show <i>why</i></b> railroading is <i>no</i> fun and why non-railroading <i>is</i> fun. <br/>3) Then <b>repeat</b> those points every time you mention any GM task.  <br/>4) Establish an icon (or series of icons) to form a <b>visual connection</b> to each principle that you <i>really</i> need the GM to remember.  <br/>5) Provide <b>actual play</b> examples of a GM being surprised and following the players' lead and it being awesome.<br/>6) <b>Focus</b>.  Shorten the "how to" portion of the book by 87%.<br/>7) Provide a <b>list of instances</b> where you might railroad without meaning to or even noticing it.  Show what to do instead in those instances.<br/><br/>Or, omit all GM instruction from the core book and then publish an anti-railroading pamphlet called <i>Secrets of the Master Storyteller</i>.  Make it pretty, and cheaper than the other Vampire products.  You know the fans will buy it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395998/#Comment_395998" name="Item_159" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T00:06:05+00:00" title="November  3, 2012 12:06AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 4:26AM by Rob_Alexander.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            8) Have the final text proofread by a community that is ultra-sensitive to textual suggestions of railroading and extremely hostile to them.

Interestingly, I feel it is actually easier for players to "railroad" each other playing by the LARP text than for Storytellers to "railroad" players by the 1ed rulebook text.  What is PvP except forcing someone else to give you the outcome you want?<br/><br/>PS Incoherence is the mark of a good RPG. The more coherent a game is the less player input there is to it.  The less player input there is to it, the less player freedom. Basically really focused games are built already-railroaded, but it's the designer railroading the game organizer rather than the game organizer railroading the players. Since designers are distant figures indistinctly understood at worst and completely incommunicado at best, incoherence is better than coherence.<br/><br/><img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Am I doin' it right guyz?<br/><br/>Okay, back to it tomorrow.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396002/#Comment_396002" name="Item_161" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T00:32:53+00:00" title="November  3, 2012 12:32AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty much the epitome of a matter of taste, elevating incoherent design over coherent. Good for anybody who likes it, I suppose. I mean, declaring that a given game text is an incoherent mess you can read any which way is just about the nastiest thing classic Forge analysis gives as an outcome, so if you know that you like that sort of thing, then there's basically nothing that the Forge devils can do to you or your favourite game. That's about as pure a matter of taste as they come: one guy saying that he likes games to be clear in their purpose and another saying that he likes them to be vague, so as to leave room for the players to develop their own interpretation.<br/><br/>(I lie, of course there are worse things that games have been called in Forge discourse. Brain-damaging, for one. How many games that's been applied to and how many people agree with it is something else, of course.)<br/><br/>Of course the real flame wars used to be around people not wanting to accept that their favourite game is "incoherent". I don't know, maybe it's a shame thing of some sort. Can't stand thinking that there's somebody out there who doesn't like your favourite game or something. One would think that accepting that there's a school of thought that prefers something else would be easier. What's it to you if what you might call a "toolbox" is "incoherent" to somebody else...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396017/#Comment_396017" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T04:28:30+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  4:28AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I supposed I'd ask it the other way around - ie, asking if it's possible to write a RPG which has the sampled text from the first posts (ignoring copyright issues for now) and then write rules after it which totally klank against and disrupt a notion of story, prewritten or otherwise.<br/><br/>I'd think yes, it's possible to write it deliberately.

We'd play with 7-8 players and a GM, with maybe 2 or 3 players coming in every week and the rest having various levels of attendance. From what I recall, our adventures were an alternating pattern of Cthulhuesque breadcrumb-following (often leading to exasperated roadblocks where we'd sit around and wait for our enemies to do something bad so we could try and pick them up again) and AD&amp;D-style 'dungeon'crawling where we'd rock through various nightclubs, mansions, sewers etc. fighting other supernatural (or not) enemies. <br/><br/>I remember playing a little, but the games were always dominated by one or two players and I can remember most of us would sit around for ages waiting for a fight so we could do something, with very little engagement in the game. I don't think Mark Rein dot Hagen (or indeed any more successful Vampire developer) would've had to stay very long in our sessions to identify a few of our problems.<br/><br/>But what this discussion is saying to me is that I should crack out Vampire and give it another shot, using all my newly-formed bad/good habits from storygaming.

Players of RPGs generally when I was playing all had some D&amp;D experience in their backgrounds, and we tended to have a lot of fighty-fighty on a regular basis, and actually very little in the way of angstiness or really much else. I also saw a good bit of semi-Cthulhu style mystery following ( but that would have been fairly common with the folks who had some Cyberpunk or Shadowrun background too).<br/> <br/>I know that nasty incoherence word has come up in this converstaion, but I have questioned before how much of that incoherence wasn't in the game text ( although I agree it could have been better written, along the lines of what David Berg suggested above) but was simply the clash between the common playstyles of RPGs generally and what VtM was at least trying to get in as a playstyle ( even while using fighty/adventure style mechanics).<br/><br/>Really, for me, the clash with VtM was one between the folks coming from a Genre Emulation: VampAngstGothicism Right To Dream mindset ( and I'm guessing these are the folks who ended up dropping a whole lot of mechanics on a regular basis but lurved the fluff) and the Superheroes with Fangs folks, largely coming from a semi-gamist mindset.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch" title="Will_Hindmarch"><img alt="Will_Hindmarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.wordstudio.net/coffee_ring-32px.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_Hindmarch">Will_Hindmarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396038/#Comment_396038" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T08:11:32+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  8:11AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 8:13AM by Will_Hindmarch.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why didn't people ten years ago practice modern medicine? What morons.<br/><br/>Am I doing it right?<br/><br/>Since I was apparently playing games using story game approaches back in the day\u2014using improv teachings I was learning as a community-theater boy in actual play of <i>Vampire</i> (2nd) and <i>Werewolf</i> and <i>Wraith</i>, for example\u2014I can say with confidence that those games could participate in what we might otherwise call very modern styles of play. (I'm something of a hipster about this and I hate the position it puts me in.) And I didn't come to <i>Vampire</i> on any escape trajectory; I played D&amp;D in a fairly collaborative, improv, freeform manner, too. I didn't realize I was doing it "wrong." I thought I was having fun.<br/><br/>I feel like there's an impulse to lay blame at the feet of games like <i>Vampire</i> for messing up someone's experience somewhere or doing damage to the course of the hobby or whatever. That strikes me as hazy and pejorative. First, I learned a lot about play from those books and those games, so I'm evidence that reading them isn't necessarily confounding. I'll also offer testimony that you can play those games in the style that we attribute to story games (but which, IME, was around in the 1990s), even if, yes, some GM and player principles may have to be imported. I did a lot of what we'd call "hacking" back then.<br/><br/>Second, what's a rebellion without elders to rebel against? I doubt modern games\u2014even if they're made or played in spite of the previous generation of games\u2014would exist as they do if not for the course of history. Even if you want to regard the '90s storytelling style as a dead end offshoot (I don't), I don't get why it's so alarming or galling or whatever. It's a thing. It happened.

Very cogent question, considering the Storyteller makes the framework and the consequences and the players make the plot decisions.  The only thing we've seen so far is that the rules "direct" things. <br/><br/>Some people in this thread have pointed out that by this, you could play the game completely diceless.  And indeed, much of the game is set up to be that way. The automatic success rule can keep a lot of play going without touching the dice, and "Complications" like the combat system don't need to be used. <br/><br/>So let's talk about the rules' role in Vampire play. After a short intro paragraph (addressed to the Storyteller), we get a firm re-establishment of the toolkit nature of the game:\n<blockquote>It is up to you to present the rules to the players in such a way that they easily understand how they function, yet  are able to use them flexibly enough to provide for realistic and dramatic scenes and encounters. <br/><br/>As a Storyteller, you will quickly come  to develop your own  personal  style.  Part  of  this  will  arise  from  your  own personality and  inclinations, and part of  it will reflect the  tastes of your players. The range of different styles is best illustrated by reference  to  two archetypes, representing  the opposite ends of  the scale. Both are exaggerated, and you will probably end up somewhere in between. <br/><br/>At one end of  the scale is  the Rules Lawyer. This type of Storyteller  insists on dice rolls for everything, and applies the letter of  the rules to the fullest extent. If a character is sitting on <br/>a chair, the Rules Lawyer might ask the player to roll Dexterity to avoid falling off. There is a knock at  the door, roll Perception to see if you hear it. The character rises to answer the door, but must first roll Dexterity to stand up successfully, Perception to find  the door, and Dexterity again  to get it open. Ridiculous, of course, but  it demonstrates how  extreme  it can get. <br/><br/>At the other end of  the scale is  the Freeformer. To this type of Storyteller, the story is everything. Dice are rolled only occasionally, and then only for the nice sound they make. In fact,  the Storyteller decides without dice  exactly what  is  going  to happen, and is guiding the players through it  just  as though they were reading a book. Character actions may direct  the story, but it is  the Storyteller who decides  the results of the actions. <br/><br/>Vampire as  a  game  tends  to  be more  free  form  than rules-oriented. The  rules are  there to help, not to govern, but the players should have the maximum freedom of action, and <b>never</b> feel  that their decisions and actions do not make a difference. </blockquote>\nEmphasis in original. I think this may be the first time a word has been emphasized in any of the sections I've seen. <br/><br/>So this section basically describes a scale, with both extremes being bad, and says, the game tends towards the "free form" side of the scale. So our previous guesses/analyses were spot on.  (Interesting that the text seems to also think that the rules help prevent railroading!)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal" title="JackFractal"><img alt="JackFractal" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JackFractal">JackFractal</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396043/#Comment_396043" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T09:27:50+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  9:27AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Worse than why, HOW?

In the text you've posted.<br/><br/>A selective reading of the text could allow you to extract a methodology opposed to railroading. Another reading of the text could easily allow you to extract a methodology supporting illusionism and railroading. <br/><br/>I don't necessarily find either of these methods shocking or abhorrent, but I think you're exaggerating a bit to suggest that this game is <i>stridently against</i> the play-style it has so often appeared to promote.<br/><br/>In addition, special powers and backgrounds do not prevent railroading. That's a non-sequitur. Railroading being an out-of-universe meta-diegetic pattern, the two things you mentioned are in-universe diegetic elements. Diegetic elements cannot solve meta-diegetic problems.<br/><br/>So I guess my big question is, given that Vampire experienced a great deal of dysfunctional play, why did it do so? If the books unambiguously promote positive play-habits (a fact I do not believe) were people just ignoring the books? <br/><br/>If so, why?

(I couldn't resist the exclamation points, sorry sorry.)  Not named that of course. But let's see what the game advises about when to ignore the rules.\n<blockquote>One of the  biggest decisions  a  Storyteller will  ever make comes when  he  first decides  to  ignore  the  rules. This  is perfectly legitimate, provided  it's done  for  the right reasons. <br/><br/>From time to time, situations will arise where applying the full letter of the  rules would cause  the entire  story to collapse. <br/><br/>For  example,  the  characters  have  just  spent  several  weeks finding and  recovering an ancient tome, which will give them vital  information about  the Sabbat who have entered  the city. Without the  information  in  this tome,  the characters will stand no chance at all of  surviving an encounter with the Black Hand, who  have  become  alerted  to  the  characters'  existence  and <br/>intentions, and will  react soon. <br/><br/>A  freak  botch  sends  the  character carrying  the  tome falling from a rooftop into a huge fire.  It is the result of a mortal Vampire-hunter  trying  to  destroy  the  characters,  though  he knows  nothing  of their mission. The tome  is  lost forever,  the characters are doomed to die at the hands of  the Sabbat, the city cannot be saved, and  the whole Chronicle comes  to  an end. <br/><br/>As well as being a crushing and probably undeserved defeat for the characters, this single bad roll means that the story cannot proceed.  That can be  very  frustrating  if you've spent your hard-earned cash on buying it or devoted several weeks of spare  time  to designing  it.  A  couple different repairs are possible,  though, so don't despair. <br/><br/>One is  to discount  the  botch - reduce  its severity so that the book is saved, or simply have the player repeat the roll. This works fine, but  you may find players relying on this kind of aid  from  you every time they get themselves into  trouble. Best not to get them  into bad habits if you can avoid it. <br/><br/>Another option is to amend the story. The book is  lost, but somewhere there is another  source  of  information which can replace it. Perhaps one of  the Sabbat is sickened by the excesses of his fellows, or moved by ambition or  revenge to turn against them.  He  seeks  out  the  characters  and  arms  them  with  the knowledge they need. Again, this will work, but you may find players blatantly sitting around, waiting  for you  to spoon-feed them  in  future  situations. <br/><br/>Thirdly, you might allow the falling character a superhuman (or  super-Vampiric) effort  to throw the book  to one of  his comrades so that  the story can continue.  This is  probably the best option  for most Chronicles, but it may not work for you. <br/><br/>There are other ways out of  this situation as well; your job, and privilege,  is  to  decide which means you will use. </blockquote>\nTwo interesting things about this:<br/><br/>1- Ignoring the rules is done in this example to PROTECT player characters and their efforts from being useless, and preserve the chain of player action-Storyteller consequence.  Particularly note how the Sabbat are described. They are "poised to react". This reinforces what the Storyteller's job is.<br/><br/>2 - Note that the defeat due to the botch is considered "undeserved". The players may not deserve to win but they don't deserve to lose because of one roll. Remember the "Don't" above about luck?<br/><br/>3 - The preferred option is NOT what-people-would-call illusionism (bah, it's all participationism, jerks), it's just extending the situation a bit. <br/><br/>I know that's three, but I'm a heavy tipper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396045/#Comment_396045" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T09:35:04+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  9:35AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't necessarily find either of these methods shocking or abhorrent, but I think you're exaggerating a bit to suggest that this game is <i>stridently against</i> the play-style it has so often appeared to promote.<br/></blockquote>\nHow many times does it have to say it?

And sorry, Jack.<br/><br/>Anyway, as mentioned, most games of this era, or any era, give very little attention to failure states. I've scoured the book and I can only find a couple of little paragraphs, in the Storyteller section:\n<blockquote>In  the excitement of the game, especially when things are getting tense,  there  is a possibility  for even  the most mild\xad mannered  of players  to  become  agitated,  start  shouting  and perhaps drown out  the others. You may  find  that players with strong  personalities  are  dominating  the  quieter ones,  and  in extreme  cases  the  loudest  player  in  the  group  may  end  up running  the  entire party of characters. This, obviously,  is  un\xaddesirable, and players who feel  themselves to be overshadowed or  ignored  will  become  bored  or  resentful,  and  won't  enjoy things as much as they should. <br/><br/>Take care to  listen to all of  your players equally. If one player  states that another player's  character  is doing something, check with that  character's player  first.  1f  one or more players  are dominating  the action and  not  letting  the others participate as fully as  their characters deserve, take  them aside and point out the difficulty as diplomatically as possible. Ask everyone to co\xadoperate and remind them that  this is not a competitive game, and those players who seek to dominate others are gaining nothing but unpopularity. As  the  final  sanction, you may decide not to invite an unrepentantly  troublesome player to  future games. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396059/#Comment_396059" name="Item_179" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T10:41:55+00:00" title="November  3, 2012 10:41AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 10:57AM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a 2-page section on storytelling techniques, including description (long flowery descriptions), imagination (don't always use long flowery descriptions), timing, changes of pace, deadlines, delaying success, secrecy, intrigue, invading their "safe haven", scope, and dependents.  Advanced storytelling techniques include flashbacks, parallel stories, foreshadowing, dream sequences, and symbolism.  Not going to go into a huge amount of detail on these...they're pretty much what you would expect from a game published in 2015.<br/><br/>There's also two pages of different sorts of conflict that you might put at the core of your stories (this also includes ANOTHER bit on why you shouldn't railroad and how to avoid it, similar to what's gone before...what the hell, I'll put it in):\n<blockquote>The best way  to be  ready  for what  the characters are going  to do next is to  simply have a  fum  and detailed grasp of the setting.  There are a number of Vampire supplements which you can use to gain an even more detailed understanding of  the world, but your efforts are  essential to give stories the depth they truly  require. <br/><br/>Though  the  players  may  go  and  do  what  they  want,  it doesn't mean you don't do any work. On the contrary, it simply means you  have to work all  the harder to come up with appro\xadpriate things to  interest them - such  things as characters, plots twists,  traps and obscure items. </blockquote>\nAnd in the theme section, here's an antidote to the "but it promised SOOO MUCH..."\n<blockquote>The story becomes larger  than  life when  you make  it not only an  adventure but a moral  lesson as well.  Faerie  tales, myths and  even Star Trek\u2122  use  this  technique  to make stories more vivid and compelling.  This gets at why we  tell  stories in the first place. Stories almost always have a moral. However, in good stories, the  lesson that is  learned changes from  listener to listener.  The Storyteller shouldn't have a prepackaged lesson ready;  rather,  it  should present a situation and  let  the  players make of  it what  they will. <br/><br/>The theme is not meant to make the story more serious or high-browed.  Neither is it intended to give you  the opportu\xadnity to diatribe on right and wrong or good and evil.  The theme is simply intended  to help you create a better story, a story with more depth, pathos and significance. Don't  put too large an onus on  the theme and  it will work out for you. </blockquote>\nYes, in this game we might create a story as "true and terrible", as a previous poster put it, as a Star Trek (tm) episode!!! But don't count on it, it's not that high-browed or serious.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396060/#Comment_396060" name="Item_180" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T10:43:50+00:00" title="November  3, 2012 10:43AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And in the plot twist section, just in case there was any doubt:\n<blockquote>Climax: This is the great  resolution of  the story, where all questions are answered (or at least some).

In any case, it must be a  logical result of events  that you set into motion at the start of  the story.  The climax  cannot be  forced  - the  players must be  emotionally prepared for your ending.

It's a lot more general and question-asking than the Chronicle Concept, which makes sense given that it would have to be customized based on what the characters do.<br/><br/>The concepts explained are: Adventure, The Masquerade, Tragedy, Jyhad, Escape, War of Ages, Intrigue, Vendetta, Mission, Urban Nightmare, Romance, Wilderness Trek and Redemption.<br/><br/>Here's an example of one of them:\n<blockquote>The Masquerade:  Neonates'  temptations to make the world what they will via their newfound powers must be tempered by a realization of what an aroused world can do to them.  Often the players will have to deal with hunters without killing,  injuring or even  threatening  them.  At  the  same  time, they must prevent mortals from discovering the truth about the existence of Vampires.  For  instance,  killing  the  newspaper reporter hot on  their  trail will only draw  the attention of even more  journalists, so the players must figure out  a way to get him off the  trai1. <br/><br/>Alternatively, some other Vampires may become too obvious  for  the  players  to  allow  their  activities  to  continue unhindered.  How do they deal with a rock star who can back up <br/>his claims to  immortality? </blockquote>\n(Yes, let's just use an actual Anne Rice plot.)<br/><br/>Although this is pretty comprehensive, I think we've all agreed an explicit and consistent explanation of the difference between Chronicle, Story and Plot could have been a helpful through-line.

So that's only partly a contradiction. The player's shouldn't always succeed, but they shouldn't fail due to just bad luck or in a way that is "unwarranted", i.e. that's not connected to their choices and actions.<br/><br/>Also, the non-competitive nature of the game is based on the PCs needing to be a team (that's why players pushing EACH OTHER around is bad.)  It doesn't address PCs trying to win. Not at all a contradiction, not even the slightest. Go back and look at the "winning" section. There's a ton more stuff on teamwork too.<br/><br/>And "more significance" is not the same as "high-browed". It's a scale, high-browed shit is at one end, nonsense is at the other, using themes gives your game more significance than not using one...you know, like a theme in a Star Trek (tm) episode!

What morons.<br/><br/>Am I doing it right?<br/><br/>Since I was apparently playing games using story game approaches back in the day\u2014using improv teachings I was learning as a community-theater boy in actual play of <i>Vampire</i> (2nd) and <i>Werewolf</i> and <i>Wraith</i>, for example\u2014I can say with confidence that those games could participate in what we might otherwise call very modern styles of play. (I'm something of a hipster about this and I hate the position it puts me in.) And I didn't come to <i>Vampire</i> on any escape trajectory; I played D&amp;D in a fairly collaborative, improv, freeform manner, too. I didn't realize I was doing it "wrong." I thought I was having fun.<br/><br/>I feel like there's an impulse to lay blame at the feet of games like <i>Vampire</i> for messing up someone's experience somewhere or doing damage to the course of the hobby or whatever. That strikes me as hazy and pejorative. First, I learned a lot about play from those books and those games, so I'm evidence that reading them isn't necessarily confounding. I'll also offer testimony that you can play those games in the style that we attribute to story games (but which, IME, was around in the 1990s), even if, yes, some GM and player principles may have to be imported. I did a lot of what we'd call "hacking" back then.<br/><br/>Second, what's a rebellion without elders to rebel against? I doubt modern games\u2014even if they're made or played in spite of the previous generation of games\u2014would exist as they do if not for the course of history. Even if you want to regard the '90s storytelling style as a dead end offshoot (I don't), I don't get why it's so alarming or galling or whatever. It's a thing. It happened. Let's learn, look forward, and play, right?<br/><br/>I mean, how dare propeller planes get in the way of the invention of the jet engine? They should have just designed planes <i>better</i> back then.<br/><br/><i>(Edit: Someone told me to be more provocative online.

And especially no one has ever claimed [S-G APPROVED PLAYSTYLE] didn't exist in the '90s.  The whole issue is over how easy or hard it was to get at [S-G APPROVED PLAYSTYLE] using the tools the book provided, in the language that it did.  <br/><br/>(Which is probably an impossible argument to resolve since it is completely anecdotal, but everyone likes a good debate)\n<blockquote>Since I was apparently playing games using story game approaches back in the day\u2014using improv teachings I was learning as a community-theater boy</blockquote>\nThanks for pointing out that's a tool you brought to VtM and not one it provided you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396076/#Comment_396076" name="Item_186" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T13:03:15+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  1:03PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 1:04PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My only prior game was D&amp;D, so I was steeped in the railroading of haphazardly written D&amp;D modules...so Vampire 1ed was the first game I ever read that said "seriously, don't railroad, don't do it, DO NOT DO IT".

As I said, we can imagine all kinds of contexts for that example that mean different things.  I don't think the example proves much of anything except that the game is trying to emphasize decision and consequence and sometimes fluke die rolls will get in the way of that.  <br/><br/>Like, I don't think the example really has a context in which getting up on the roof is the question. They're on the roof, we assume due to normal but somewhat blinkered play, uh oh, a fluke roll means the game might end up being dissatisfying and un-fun for everyone if we don't do something about it. Don't throw your game off a cliff, instead, do something else.  Of course if you can prevent the example from occurring at all, the book clearly counts that as a win!<br/><br/>All right, on to other examples. People who say "oh, this book doesn't SHOW you how to play" are also drunk, because that example is one of many, MANY examples in the book. As I mentioned, even the art is an example of a plotline involving a vampire lady who ends up obsessed with this vampire dude and then Embraces a guy who look like him in the modern age and he kills her. It's pretty neat.<br/><br/>Here's some more:<br/><br/>There's four pages of an "Example of Play" which is written as a fiction on the left hand column and with game mechanics on the right hand column. Here's an example paragraph from each:<br/>\n<blockquote>The only access  to  the brewery  is  through  a  rooftop doorway.  There is no easy way up  the brewery building itself, but a  restaurant next door, Daley's, has a  fire  escape and  the jump  to  the brewery rooftop  isn't  that  tough, especially  for  a Vampire.  Mark decides that it is of moderate difficulty (a 6 or better  needed  on  a  ten-sided  die)  to  jump  from  the  roof of Daley's to the brewery.  Elucid is the first character to arrive at the brewery. After climbing the fire escape, he rolls his Strength + Athletics to see if he makes it across the gap to the roof  of  the brewery.  Elucid has a Strength of 4 and an Athletics of 2.  He therefore picks up 6 (4+2) ten-sided die.  This is his Dice Pool. Elucid needs to get  at  least  one  six or  better on his dice to succeed in  jumping  to  the  roof of the  brewery.  He  rolls  and  gets  a 9,7,7.4,2,1.  Stewart  has  rolled  3  dice of seven  or better  for Elucid, but he has also rolled a  I, which cancels out one of his successes,  leaving  him  with  2  successes.  Therefore,  Elucid leaps across the gap and lands safely on the  roof. The  Storyteller has Malcolm and Travis make the same  action when they arrive and both succeed, though Malcolm only has one success and for a  second,  almost  falls  over  the  edge  before  he  regains  his balance. </blockquote>\n<blockquote>With  superhuman  grace,  Elucid  leapt  the  distance from the roof of Daley's  to the brewery. Word had it that the only entrance was through the brewery's roof  Sure enough, Elucid could make  out  the  forms  of various  other Kindred  as  they descended down  the  stairway  to  his  left.  A  young  black boy shoved his way past,  jostling Elucid into  another Kindred,  a rugged man with a wild, drugged look in  his eyes.  The  two of them stared at Elucid openly, and gave him wide berth.  He was used to  that. </blockquote>\nIt's cool, and mood-setting and stuff, but it didn't really add much to understanding the game past providing more examples for how and when to roll stuff, which was already done (as I mentioned) extensively in the character creation and system sections.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396094/#Comment_396094" name="Item_192" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T15:58:10+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  3:58PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me from these quotes that, while there is indeed some good stuff in there, all of it is mixed in, often in the same paragraph, with utter trash that obviates that good stuff.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'd say VtM is 100% shit <i>as a product</i>.

I mean, if your reading of the game is the reasonable and dominant one, then one would expect that there would be such examples to offset the unfortunately railroad-ish ones, right? I understand that most examples in this style of game-writing tend to be about how to perform task resolution (in itself a neutral issue in this context, I'm sure we agree), but maybe there are others that show how a player makes a momentous decision or the dice come up sideways unexpectedly and how the Storyteller deals with that. Besides the book-burning example, of course - as already discussed above, it's apparently either a strong hint towards railroading or advice to discount the dice when you've asked for a roll that shouldn't have been made in the first place (ie. one that had the wrong outcome the Storyteller didn't anticipate).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396099/#Comment_396099" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T16:25:25+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  4:25PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 4:30PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>as if you are to use the rules, but you mustn't use them, but you must, but you mustn't...the swirling contradiction.</blockquote>\nYou have just successfully described most of human existence in most societies during most of history. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><br/>I don't know, I'm reading the same excerpts you are, and while I can see that there are contradictions, I can also see that the text is trying to convey a rationale for threading your way through those contradictions to get a better game experience. While I think we can agree that it falls short of the ideal, it's at least making a laudable attempt to teach what the authors felt were Vampire's best practices, and coming back to it multiple times in different ways in case one of them might click with the reader more than the others.<br/><br/>I didn't come into Vampire until 2nd edition, but from what I remember, I understood the "don't let one botch ruin the game" pretty clearly at the time. I and the people I played with were all in agreement that it sucked when a game ended in abrupt, abject failure for everyone because one person got one low roll. We'd been through the AD&amp;D meatgrinders, and all it taught us was that you should never get invested in your PC or the plot, because the odds were against you ever seeing a satisfying ending for either one. Vampire was saying, no, you <i>should</i> care about your characters and about the overall story, and in the worst case scenario where a freak botch could destroy them, rather than shrugging and saying "Welp, I guess that's game over," the GM should consider ways to let the game (the characters and what they're doing) continue on. And furthermore, that there were bad ways to do this and better ways to do this, and the GM should aim for "better" whenever possible.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go back and play 1e or even 2e if you paid me (well, unless you're a crazy millionaire or something; my price isn't cheap, but I definitely have one), but what I'm reading here is reminding me of all the good things I learned from Vampire.

The only real, hard fact we have is that people bought and played the game in spades, and now they have put out a 20th anniversary edition of it and it's selling like hot cakes. If your model doesn't take that into account, your model is useless.\n<blockquote>But even the less horrific ones suffer from the problem that you can't possibly get through them unless the GM cheats. At some point the players will all fail some roll, and that's the end of the adventure, unless the GM "cheats" somehow to keep it alive. This necessity becomes a hard-core teaching method to get GMs to understand how to use illusionism and all sorts of force to railroad. </blockquote>\nThat never ever happened to me in 24 years, and I haven't heard of something like that until I started reading RPG messageboards like this.\n<blockquote>Johnstone, I include rolls for survival in this, not just clues. I believe it was in Masks of Nyarlathotep in which the first part of the scenario was to climb up a wall of collapsing glacial ice, to get details of something carved in a rock (which, due to the collapse of the ice had to be inspected immediately, or be lost to the murky depths underneath permanently. I recall two thirds of the party dying there, due to bad rolls. First scene. We decided to reboot the scenario, and just do it over. Only one PC died in this case, but apparently that was enough. Between the rebooting and dying, nobody was interested in continuing to play the scenario. Just didn't seem right. </blockquote>\nYou got wrong the campaign (is not Masks) and also, the rules. The rules don't work like that. Your GM made some misinterpretation on it. Sorry. Those things that people on indie messageboards attribute to CoC simply don't happen.\n<blockquote>Note that this was what happened if you didn't "fudge" and figure out some way to have the PCs survive. My GM, Jim, was a stickler for playing by the rules (no, not a "killer GM" just the most honest person anyone has ever met). To whit, in another scenario run by Jim, my friend Dave had his character die by having his head blown off by fumbling a roll with fishing with dynamite. In yet another scenario, Dave's character died falling off a ladder. Ooooh... scary mythos-y stuff there.</blockquote>\nIn the Call of Cthulhu tale, there is one character that dies because some heavy shit falls upon him. And Captain Joahnsen dies by a poisoned needle. So what? In HPL tales people bite  abullet and die. Dave's character was manipulating a dangerous explosive. It went off. So what? If Dave swore to never play the game again, it was Dave's problem, not the game's.\n<blockquote>But they came up in every single scenario that I played of CoC.</blockquote>\nI'm sorry to hear that. How do you explain that thousands of players and GMs have wonderful experiences playing CoC, so much that people like Kenneth Hite says that CoC is the greatest game ever? <br/><br/>Seriously, I get the impression that most of your criticisms against some trad games (and therefore, your attempts to create systems that fix those problems) stem just from playing with dicks. Or something like it.\n<blockquote>Robin Laws would not have created this system had he not seen the same issues in CoC play. He's said this explicitly, and you can probably find it online somewhere.  </blockquote>\nYou are making this up. What he and Hite said at the intro of ToC is that they don't think that CoC needs any fixing. They just wanted to provide a different perspective, because CoC already does what it does too well. They use the example of Akira Kurosawa versioning Shakespeare's works, without that meaning that Shakespeare sucked.\n<blockquote>I dunno, still seems like shitty market research at the least.</blockquote>\nYeah, because creating one of the most successful games ever is a show of bad marketing research. Seriously, how can you sustain such a position?\n<blockquote>So yeah, I'd say VtM is 100% shit <i>as a product</i>.</blockquote>\nA game that provides countless hours of fun to thousands of persons, inspiring them to play it again and again, cannot be shit under any definition of shit in any sane world. One thing is to discuss what can be improved on it - many things, for sure - and another is to pretend something so unreal.\n<blockquote>Any game where functional play requires that much modification is both bad as a piece of RPG writing and harmful to the social cohesion of any local play group that tries to use it RAW.</blockquote>\nThousands of happy Vampire gamers say you are wrong, mate.\n<blockquote>Any RPG should be able to be played 100% by the book and be fun. No RPG text should contradict itself every couple of pages. That's not too much to ask, even in 1991. Such games did exist then; even 2E D&amp;D was much, much more coherent at its core*.</blockquote>\nIf so many people was able to play the game and enjoy it without a hitch for 20 years straight, maybe the problem is not in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396105/#Comment_396105" name="Item_199" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T17:10:53+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  5:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 5:19PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Except then we have rule zero, approving freeform making it up.</blockquote>\nNot...really? Like, that's not what the rule zero text says?\n<blockquote>I've basically given two options of either it's their own choice, or they were railroaded.<br/><br/>Are you saying there's a third option? Otherwise such 'scene setting' is just regular old railroading.</blockquote>\nWait...you don't think there's any other thing that happens in games with GMs other than player choice and railroading?<br/><br/>?!?!??<br/><br/>This seems like burying the lede. Can you expand on this, maybe in its own thread?\n<blockquote>I think if any progress is to be made on this subject of conversation, it'd probably be granting that the book fails, to some degree, in it's goal. And it's okay to play a game that fails its goal, it's fine.</blockquote>\n100 percent of all things on this fallen earth are imperfect and miss the mark. I completely agree.\n<blockquote>Like, I don't think the example really has a context in which getting up on the roof is the question. They're on the roof, we assume due to normal but somewhat blinkered play, uh oh, a fluke roll means the game might end up being dissatisfying and un-fun for everyone if we don't do something about it. Don't throw your game off a cliff</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Here's the assignation of responsibility - was the GM breaking the rules when he called for that check?</blockquote>\nNo? Maybe he just made a mistake, or didn't quite get what was going on, or was....(gasp)...A NORMAL HUMAN BEING?!?!?!?!&gt;?\n<blockquote>If not, then who is throwing the game off a cliff?</blockquote>\nNo one, the game doesn't want you to do that.  <br/><br/>Wait, is the question about an imaginary counterfactual where the GM says "you fall into the flames" (rolls damage) "the book is destroyed, and you burn to death" (adjudicates Sabbat attack fairly and without remorse, playing out the consequences of player decisions fairly and completely) "the rest of you are all killed, the end" and everyone (including the GM) is disappointed and grouchy that a bad die roll ended up ruining the game?  And then...you're asking whose fault it is this game was ruined? Seems pretty obvious to me it's the GM, who is ignoring the suggestion in the Vampire 1ed. book to not let a die roll take a game down a blocked path. <br/><br/>Or maybe the designer, who didn't make that suggestion strong enough?<br/><br/>Or maybe the players, who didn't understand the system well enough and got themselves in a bind due to their own boneheaded decisions?<br/><br/>Blame is not what the example is about, I don't think I can answer.\n<blockquote>I think you're treating extrapolation as being the same as being shown. Unless all vampire play is is jumping from from/to brewery roofs and nothing else.</blockquote>\nWhat in the hell?!?<br/><br/>Did you just say that examples don't show how to play??!<br/><br/>What are they there for then? I mean, here they're obviously put in place to intentionally hurt people, but in other games, why are examples of play there?\n<blockquote>It's cool, and mood-setting and stuff, but it didn't really add much to understanding the game past providing more examples for how and when to roll stuff</blockquote>\n<blockquote>When to roll stuff. Does this 'when' seem tied into the idea of story to you? <br/><br/>Apart from the books telling you its a story telling game, how does this roll for jumping across a roof tie into story. Indeed, as Deliverator asks, what would happen if they failed?</blockquote>\nIn this example perhaps more than any other. In fact, I think that's the only really great thing about this example. It literally puts the roll in the context of an overblown purple-prose Vampire story.<br/><br/>And as for "what would happen if they failed", It's a silly question since I'm not the Storyteller and you aren't the players? I mean, I don't know what would happen if they failed...they would get injured, do you mean? Or maybe they would get in another way, or find some other method of getting the information? Or if the GM has made a mistake in setting things up this way he fixes his mistake somehow? I don't even understand how you expect that any human being on the planet could answer this question, how any text on the planet could answer it. <br/><br/>So let's say in a parenthesis here it says "(The Storyteller knows if he doesn't make the jump he will be rolling X levels of damage, and may have to trade favors with Bob in order to find out what happened inside.)"<br/><br/>Then you leap on a chair and scream "Ah HA, what happens if the character doesn't persuade Bob to trade favors!?!"<br/><br/>And then I unveil the footote where it says "If the character doesn't persuade Bob to trade favors for the intel, they might gain it in some other way, through their backgrounds. Be creative!" <br/><br/>And then you leap from the chair to the table and bellow "And what if the character put all their Backgroud points in Generation and doesn't have any that would apply to gathering intel!!!!!!!!!"  <br/><br/>And then I flip confusedly to the back of the book and in Appendix L discover "If the characters don't have Backgrounds that apply, then the next time they're dealing with a Vampire that does have the backgrounds, have that Vampire scoff at their ignorance of what happened and give them a thumbnail outline. Be sure to shade it in favor of that Vampire's motivations!"<br/><br/>And then you leap from the table and swing on the ceiling fan, howling "What if there are no other Vampires in the Chronicle!!!!??!"<br/><br/>I don't know, I don't even understand why this is a question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396106/#Comment_396106" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T17:12:54+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  5:12PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 5:16PM by C_Edwards.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If so many people was able to play the game and enjoy it without a hitch for 20 years straight, maybe the problem is not in the game.</blockquote>\nWell, see, that's the real issue. With game text that contradictory what does "play the game" even mean? Obviously everyone was playing a rather drawn out interpretation of what they thought it meant, or relying on unrelated tools and methodology. Some more successfully than others. The 'game' was successful due to presenting some very cool and sexy style and because of what the text promised, but despite what the text actually delivered.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div

I understand that most examples in this style of game-writing tend to be about how to perform task resolution (in itself a neutral issue in this context, I'm sure we agree), but maybe there are others that show how a player makes a momentous decision or the dice come up sideways unexpectedly and how the Storyteller deals with that. <br/></blockquote>\nNo examples of in-the-moment rejiggering when a player does something unexpected, no. I agree with you that would have been awesome.<br/><br/>There is one interesting example of a Storyteller doing Chronicle design, in which he creates a Chronicle with only 7 non-player character vampires, a Prince who pretends he's all that and is really weak, paranoid and ineffectual, and puts the PCs personal lives (and deaths) as the only thing going on in the story that matters politically.  In other words, the 7 NPC Vampires, including the Prince, are at most allies with 1 or 2 others. The team of 4-5 PCs is easily more effective.<br/><br/>From the perspective of someone coming from (say) a Dragonlance module, this is a Storyteller designing a Chronicle and intentionally throwing out many "standard railroading tools" (the uber-powerful NPC, the supernatural power beyond the PC's reach, etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396113/#Comment_396113" name="Item_203" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T17:33:57+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  5:33PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I completely disagree.<br/><br/>Most Vampire games I've seen share most elements, and the ones they don't can be just attributed to the differences between players and GMs, just like with any other game, as DitV, Sorcerer, BW, Universalis, DRYH or whatever.<br/><br/>The game promised you the chance to roleplay a vampire trying to not lose his shit in a bizantine society filled with treachery, and with many threats (both mortal and supernatural) around you, and that is what you got.

In my group and other local ones, there was TREMENDOUS variance on what people thought Vampire was "about".  The vampire politics/sectarian stuff was absolutely not a given, and the games I personally played in had none of it; our characters didn't really operate in a context of total cold war within and between sects.  Frankly, all the Noddist and apocryphal occult stuff interested us way more.<br/><br/>(as an aside, I actually skipped the VtM 2 corebook completely somehow-- my first edition was the emo-uber-alles 1st, which I never actually got to play at the time [and I haven't read it probably since then, so I don't remember any of the stuff Corley's quoting; the "reverting to human" illustrated story and all the other Anne Rice touches are the bits that stuck with me], and my college group mostly just read Vampire but actually played the other WW games instead [including Vampire Dark Ages, actually].  By the time we actually gave contemporary VtM a shot, Revised was out so we went with that, and that text pulls back HARD against "Vampire is all about jockeying for control against other undead", so "my" Vampire has never been about that)<br/><br/>In my experience most of the oWoD was like that-- there were so many incompatible themes and setting elements in every game that pretty much everyone had one specific bit that was their "in", and it was by no means a given that any two people would agree on what made a specific game cool or interesting.  Which made for exciting times when a GM would pitch a game no one else wanted in on, or worse, when assumption clash set in after the campaign had started.  We had a bunch of games that petered out after two or three sessions.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm in your unlucky 1%, but all I can do is stand by what I have personally experienced with the game, just like everyone else is doing.  I guess what I'm saying is, it's easy to deny that you're in the middle of a minefield if you haven't actually seen someone step on one and get blown up.\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Your anecdotical evidence, or Ron Edwards', or any other person's (including myself) means basically jack with a healthy side serving of squat. </blockquote>\nYes, you are totally correct.  So why do you then follow it up with "I've never ever seen this happen nuh uh (so it is clearly impossible, and the people who say they do on message boards are implicitly lying)" like that does actually prove something?  These are not new arguments, in fact I think I have seen Corley fighting this fight on Usenet.  That's why this thread is really nice, because we're actually (mostly) sticking to analyzing the actual words in the book instead of accusing one another of being statistical outliers, based on our own sample sizes of one.<br/><br/>ANECDOTE FIIIIIIIIIIGHT                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396117/#Comment_396117" name="Item_205" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T18:30:26+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  6:30PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a flexible ruleset with lots of options for different modes of play and themes that different groups took advantage of in different ways.

That is when the feature seems buggier, since the text avoids siding with or against anyone in particular, hindering consensus.  This can certainly happen in any game, but some seem more prone to it than others, and as I've said above oWoD seems to invite this kind of failure mode. (and after reading this thread, I strongly suspect it's because getting any meaning out of the books requires such selective reading that it's hard to unsee the sailboat and recognize that other readings may exist.  See also Every Mage Flamewar Ever, To This Very Day)  <br/><br/>If one person wants to play balls-to-the-wall coked-out realpolitik, and another wants to play introspective emo weeping, Vampire tells both of them it's the perfect game to play together!  Therefore any failure on their part to get along is on them and absolutely not on the book that led them to this conclusion... somehow.<br/><br/>It is not an insoluble problem, but my group tended to solve it by playing a different game instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396123/#Comment_396123" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T19:11:59+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  7:11PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>If so many people was able to play the game and enjoy it without a hitch for 20 years straight, maybe the problem is not in the game.</blockquote>\nWell, see, that's the real issue.

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but the choice between "balls-to-the-wall coked-out realpolitik" or "introspective emo weeping" is one the Storyteller makes, right? Because those are two different Chronicles. So I don't see the text saying those two players can play this game together, not if you mean one plays the one way and the other plays the other.<br/><br/>What I'm seeing is, the text tells the Storyteller to make some executive decisions about the premise, theme and tone of the game (that's the Chronicle), and then works together with the players to make sure they create characters that implicate them in an intitial situation (that's the story). The Storyteller is empowered to enforce Chronicle premise, theme, and tone pretty strictly. The game text and rules are supposed to support either kind of Chronicle, but I'm not seeing it promise to support both at the same time.<br/><br/>So, like, the Storyteller might say, "Okay guys, this time I want some balls-to-the-wall coked-out realpolitik. The setting is Gary, and each of you is going to be implicated in the ongoing effort to get the town out from under the hooks of the Chicago vamps. I want this game to explore some of the tough choices you'll have to make to get free and stay free. Let's just make sure you've got bigger things to worry about than introspective emo weeping. Or at least, more urgent things." That's Chronicle in VtM1 terms, right? And then you start talking about your characters and their pasts, and their relationships to some key NPCs --- that's story in VtM1 terms, and that's more collaborative, right? If one player starts drifting in an introspective emo weepy direction, the Storyteller can say, "Let's reign this in a bit, because that concept doesn't really fit with what I've indicated." And then you Play To Find Out What Happens, and that's plot in VtM1 terms.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's how I make sense of what I'm seeing in this thread.

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but the choice between "balls-to-the-wall coked-out realpolitik" or "introspective emo weeping" is one the Storyteller makes, right? Because those are two different Chronicles. So I don't see the text saying those two players can play this game together, not if you mean one plays the one way and the other plays the other.<br/><br/>What I'm seeing is, the text tells the Storyteller to make some executive decisions about the premise, theme and tone of the game (that's the Chronicle), and then works together with the players to make sure they create characters that implicate them in an intitial situation (that's the story). The Storyteller is empowered to enforce Chronicle premise, theme, and tone pretty strictly. The game text and rules are supposed to support either kind of Chronicle, but I'm not seeing it promise to support both at the same time.<br/></blockquote>\nRight, so then the weeper or the politician says "nah, not for me-- I'm out", which seems kind of weird to me considering that both of them profess to love and want to play the book that says "Vampire" on it.  Whether the game is "beautifully open to interpretation and theme" or "so all over the map reaching consensus is difficult" depends on the observer I guess.<br/><br/>This is kind of a derail from the main thrust of "is this game responsible for the railroady reputation it has acquired" which the thread seems to mostly be about, but it's an issue that has totally obstructed me getting campaigns together of a game which all the prospective players ostensibly love, that I do think stems from the text.

Of course, that's a lot to ask. But in this particular respect, Vampire is in no more inherently flawed or dysfunctional than, say, D&amp;D, where you'd still have to make the same kind of choice. I don't see it as a shortcoming of the rules; it's just the way role playing games typically have to be.<br/><br/>The thing I see VtM1 doing (at least in <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley%27s">@JDCorley's</a> quotes in this thread) is, it says something like: The first step in getting a VtM1 game going is to set the agenda for a given game, and that's a thing you do as Storyteller. There are lots of different kinds of stories you can tell about vampires, but you can't play them all: pick one. Here's some ideas. Give the players a premise they can buy into -- get them excited and on board. Then, it's your job to make sure they stick to it. Be strict and crafty about that, because if you don't, the group is very likely to lose focus and drift away from the sweet spot when it comes time for them to take the lead. That's going to happen as soon as character creation is all done (and Preludes too, if you're doing that). That's when your role as Storyteller shifts to adjudicating and reacting, and the players are going to be in charge of what happens next. So make sure you strike the right note loud and clear at the very beginning, so they have the necessary cues for how to do that.<br/><br/>I'm down with that. It sounds to me like pretty sound advice for any game that doesn't have a very specific premise baked in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396138/#Comment_396138" name="Item_212" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T21:36:04+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  9:36PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 9:40PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>What would the text have to say for you to agree it says 'just go freeform'?</blockquote>\nActually Vampire DOES describe what freeform Vampire would look like! I quote it above.  The rulebook says "reject it", above. So I would just remove the reject it part if I was writing a freeform Vampire 1ed. (But I would change a whole lot of other things if I did that too...in this universe do I get to be really wealthy and good looking?)\n<blockquote>The third case, if you would describe it.</blockquote>\nLike...normal ole GM saying what's there and what happens?  I...don't even get what you're trying to get at.\n<blockquote>This seems to sum up the problematic nature of 'Don't throw your game off a cliff'.</blockquote>\nYes, it's true! If you want to blame people and yell at them destructively, bending the rules in Vampire 1ed. won't help you do that. Excellent point, I fully agree.\n<blockquote>Given how you think you can extrapolate my own questions several times ahead and think you are spot on the mark without even asking, it's not surprising you think you know what a few words in a text 'mean' in some kind of procedural way.</blockquote>\nI'm hopelessly confused about what you and Deliverator are asking then. You're asking "what happens if he misses the jump in the example" and I just don't see how that can be fruitfully addressed in ANY example from ANY text.<br/><br/>Like, let me get an example from a Story Games Pillar Of Virtue And Decency, which never hurt anyone, or damaged anyone's brain, ever, Burning Wheel Gold.  \n<blockquote>For example, my character must patch up a hole in the cistern before all the water drains out.  I have a Mason skill of B2 and the GM sets the obstacle at 2.  I want to get this done as quickly as possible and ensure success, so I ask one of the other players, 'Can you help?'  His character has Engineering B2.  The GM agrees this is an applicable skill.  The player passes me a die and I add it to my skill.</blockquote>\nIf I pointed triumphantly to that example and said "What if the other character DIDN'T have Engineering B2?" and concluded that this example "didn't tell me how to play" as a result of omitting this, that would be the same thing.\n<blockquote>So let's say in a parenthesis here it says "(The Storyteller knows if he doesn't make the jump he will be rolling X levels of damage, and may have to trade favors with Bob in order to find out what happened inside.)"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I don't know where this 'trade favours' idea even arrives from, procedurally. But will you say that part is connected with story?</blockquote>\nWait...I'm supposed to decide not just what the theoretical example in which the guy doesn't make the jump might say...but what the story in the fictional game containing the theoretical example in which the guy doesn't make the jump says?!?!  MY HEAD IS SPINNING, i do not understand\n<blockquote>You still haven't answered the question of how this brewery roof jump ties into story. Even if it's just your own notion of story.</blockquote>\nIt's...literally given in the story up there. Like, that's the one thing this example does well.  It literally is in a story in a left hand column while the rules explanations run in the right hand column.\n<blockquote>I think it's because you know it's empty - it confuses hopping from roof to roof with conflict.</blockquote>\nNnnnnnobody said that every die roll in Vampire resolves a conflict?!?!  This example didn't say there was a conflict?? Who said jumping over the roof resolved a conflict or had anything to do with a conflict?!?!  Wait!! Did I miss something somewhere?  (reading back)<br/><br/>That's not what the system does!  The system just says what happens in situations where you're not sure or where you want some direction or a jolt of randomness to add to excitement and tension.<br/><br/>Some die rolls in Vampire do resolve conflicts, but not all of them! And not this one! I'm totally down with that conclusion.

A lot of times people overlook the importance of the First Session. Some games even have introductory sessions that are different from other sessions to try to get things going in an easy way (Dogs in the Vineyard, Sons of Liberty).  But if you're going to do that, you have to end with some energy, some drive to push you into the current situation.  (Dogs and Sons both do this very successfully. There was also a "0th level adventure" for new characters to experience in AD&amp;D one time as I recall...)<br/><br/>Thus, a Prelude in which the character is killed and made into a vampire is Straight Up Wrong for many Chronicles!  It's good for Chronicles in which your family or your humanity is what you're trying to protect or regain.  It's bad for Chronicles in which you're on a motorcycle and your hair is so good.<br/><br/>The other thing is that the Prelude is <i>before</i> the story. In other words, it's part of setting up the Chronicle, the time when the Storyteller should/will have the most ridiculous railroading/force power available.  So it really is not like normal play.  This makes it a BAD introduction to normal play in every way except emotionally.  (It is better to do exposition and situation-setting through roleplay rather than through a data-dump, even if the roleplay is forced.)  What's worse, is that it's almost completely freeform (it has to be - you're establishing your stats, many of them don't exist yet).  So you are not even learning the system or trying out what stats you do have! <br/><br/>Bah, It's No Good.*<br/><br/>If I were rewriting this I would say to omit Preludes for players until they've played a few times and are along for the roller-coaster-ride of the Prelude instead of actually trying to explore/learn during the Prelude.<br/><br/>Here's the most hilarious part from the example Prelude (three pages): Lisa's character Malcolm, a private detective, has just found a gangster's body with the throat ripped out:\n<blockquote>Lisa:  This is too weird.  I'm going to get  out while the getting's good.  Malcolm  is  really  freaking out, but he doesn't show  it of course. <br/><br/>Mark:  Of  course.  You make your way back to your pad.  For  the  next  few  weeks, you  have  the  feeling  of being watched, but you never can figure out who or what is doing the watching.  Finally, after a hard day of work one day, you come back to your pad.  While you are removing your weapons, you feel a touch on your shoulder. Whirling around, you come face to face with a  ragged  looking bum. You recognize him as  the  low life  you  threw  out of one  of those  low  rent crackhouses  you <br/>cleared out  about  two months ago.  You remember him because, of all  the scum  inhabiting the crackhouse, he was  the only one who went without making a fuss, threatening to sue the city, and <br/>all  that stuff.  He had a certain dignity about him - at least for a bum.  But as you take this all in, he grabs you by the shoulders. <br/><br/>Lisa: Well, I try to break his grasp and roll to the right, toward  the dresser where my gun  is. <br/><br/>Mark:  The  bum's  grip  is  like  iron  and  you  are suddenly frozen by an almost bestial  look in his eyes. Then, like a dream, he starts to rip your throat open with his teeth.  Your hands  grip  the  hair on  the  back  of his  neck  in  an  anguished ecstasy.  (Mark goes into more detail, describing the agony and horror of  death).  You awake later, with a  thirst burning in your throat  A quick survey of your $4 alarm clock tells you  that it is 9 pm - you must have been out all day!  There is blood caked <br/>on your clothes and hair. <br/><br/>Lisa:  Hang on now, I'm feeling alright? <br/><br/>Mark:  You seem fine except for this burning thirst in your throat. </blockquote>\n"Mark goes into more detail, describing the agony and horror of death." <br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/seriously.gif"/><br/><br/>*The only good thing that could be salvaged from it is there's a solid page and a half about setting up Becoming A Vampire stories that are pretty good, could be used for Annalise games?!

"Be a fantasy adventurer" has a pretty clear line of action, you'll go out and fight monsters, gain all those levels you see XP charts for, probably earn that treasure you saw if you looked in the back of the GM book.  WHY you do it and WHERE may vary, and maybe even the HOW, but if you play a game of D&amp;D you've got a pretty clear default action plan.  It's right in the name even-- there will very likely be Dungeons and a Dragon, plan for those and you'll probably do okay.<br/><br/>Whereas Vampire says, you are a vampire.  OK, so I go drink blood, maybe turn into a bat, hate the sunlight?  And yeah, the game does all that, but that's kind of a thin action plan to work with, so the game adds the politics and the self-loathing and a bunch of other things that don't really play well together.  Some things I'd argue that are in direct opposition to each other, and I'm not sure what exactly the book does to help everyone get on the same page besides telling the GM "Make sure everyone's on the same page," with an unspoken "They're not?  Too bad."  Some people think that diversity is exactly makes VtM so great, that it's multiple games in one.  In my experience I've had a problem with people liking one or two of those games and hating the others, and not enough overlap, so we didn't play any of them.<br/><br/>Maybe spelling out that kind of meta-awareness of choosing flags in character creation more strongly would have helped, as opposed to just presenting the clans, disciplines, etc as a bowl of Chex mix pieces that are implied to all go as great together as Fighter Thief and Magic-User.  The "this is a toolbox" rhetoric never went too far with me, because it was all pretty strongly presented, player-side, as one cohesive game; I mean, no one has this problem with GURPS because it actually IS presented as an assortment of tools you use to build a game from scratch.  Like, each of the Clans has a style of game it sort of points to (Ventrue or Tremere if you want politics and secrets, Malkavians and Nosferatu if you want to be a boogeyman, etc), but their usefulness as flags is basically never mentioned and the book gives the impression it never even had the idea because the default presentation is that they're all present and actively rubbing elbows with each other.  This is a toolbox how?  This is a cabin you can rip beams out of if you feel like, more like.  Even White Wolf itself had these kinds of internal disagreements about how the game should be played, and occasionally gamelines veered hard away from certain things between editions as developers changed.  This is STILL happening if you're paying attention to what's going on with Exalted.<br/><br/>I definitely, definitely think that more recent designs are more effective in spelling out the failure points of not having a strongly baked-in and actionable default premise than any WW game ever was, and not obfuscating the lack of that kind of premise if they don't have one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396142/#Comment_396142" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T23:02:28+00:00" title="November  3, 2012 11:02PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 11:04PM by creases.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's fair. <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a> has persuaded me that the VtM1 text points in a particular direction of coherent, fun play -- but nobody's saying the text couldn't be clearer or more helpful.

Like, each of the Clans has a style of game it sort of points to (Ventrue or Tremere if you want politics and secrets, Malkavians and Nosferatu if you want to be a boogeyman, etc), but their usefulness as flags is basically never mentioned and the book gives the impression it never even had the idea because the default presentation is that they're all present and actively rubbing elbows with each other.  This is a toolbox how?  This is a cabin you can rip beams out of if you feel like, more like. </blockquote>\nThis is really interesting, and it got me thinking about something I said earlier in the thread:\n<blockquote>As an aside, even at the time I don't think I would have ever recommended Vampire to first-time players, and certainly not to first-time GMs. I totally agree with anyone who's said that it doesn't work as a game text when it's separated from the gaming culture of the '90s (and maybe from ANY era, for that matter).</blockquote>\nExpanding on this, I'm realizing that when I started playing Vampire, I'd been playing other games for quite a while. A lot of AD&amp;D2e in high school, some Star Wars, some Paranoia, some Call of Cthulhu, some Cyberpunk 2020.<br/><br/>So when I showed up at my friends' apartment to try out Vampire, I already had a lot of opinions about gaming. I had a nice long list of things I liked about gaming, and a list of things I didn't like about gaming, and even a list of things that I wasn't sure whether I liked or not but definitely wanted to try. The idea of taking a game and skipping right to ripping beams out of it, that was baked into what I might laughingly refer to as my gaming philosophy: <i>of course</i> I'm not going to engage everything in this book, I'm going to be aiming squarely at the things I like and the things I want to try, and actively resisting the stuff I already know I don't like.<br/><br/>And I don't think that attitude was at all unusual for people back then. Lots of people had opinions, lots of people came from backgrounds where the most natural thing to do was to tailor the game you ran to emphasize the parts you like and ignore the rest, and maybe even explicitly remove the stuff you don't like from the game entirely. Vampire didn't look to me like a big cohesive cabin that needed to be kept intact back then, because <i>no</i> game looked like that to me. It was all parts, and while some parts needed a lot of thought before junking them, other parts were easy to de-emphasize or ditch entirely if they didn't fit the kind of Vampire game we wanted to play. (Scarily, one part of the old Storyteller system just plain didn't work for us and we didn't even try to fix it: combat was a fucking disaster area as far as we were concerned. If you hit, you wouldn't get damage successes, and if you got damage successes, the soak roll would negate them. Every exchange took three rolls and got you precisely nowhere, so fight scenes were just huge pains in the ass. We wanted fast, decisive combat scenes, not draggy ones that made everyone involved feel incompetent and useless. And rather than fix it, I and the people I played with just did everything we could to avoid fights in-character, which I think probably cut us off from doing some of the things we really wanted to do with the game.)<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, I'm now totally convinced given my own experience and the arguments in this thread that Vampire would be a TERRIBLE choice for first-time players, first-time GMs, and pretty much anyone who was either not comfortable with or just plain not interested in being ruthlessly focused on creating their own specific play experience. If you don't know what you want out of gaming, it's insanely hard to figure out how to get it. If you DID know, or at least had enough opinions to make some solid guesses about what you wanted, it wasn't that hard to get Vampire to deliver all kinds of great, tightly-focused game experiences for you and your friends. The parts are all there and there's plenty of useful advice about how to use them, but it had a very strong assumption that you knew what parts would interest you and that you wanted to make YOUR Vampire chronicle out of them. True for a lot of people at the time (eg, all the people who did enjoy the game), not true for others (eg, the people who did not).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396149/#Comment_396149" name="Item_219" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T00:19:52+00:00" title="November  4, 2012 12:19AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BWG tells you, clearly and concisely and early in the book, with its importance flagged:<br/><br/>1) What sorts of things to roll for<br/>2) To set a consequence for failing the roll ahead of time<br/>3) How to handle it if the character doesn't have the requisite skill<br/><br/>That particular example you cited may not have had the failure consequence listed, but the book definitely tells the GM to do it, and also <i>how</i> to do it.<br/><br/>So my question remains: are there any examples in the VtM1 book wherein a PC:<br/>1) Fails a roll<br/>2) Other than in combat<br/>3) The GM doesn't discard or fudge this failed result?<br/><br/>By the way, that refrain you keep using about how everything is flawed?

Really specific tastes there! (By the way, the earlier example - jumping over the fire - suggests not that the GM discard or fudge the roll, but instead to allow an additional attempt to get through the situation in a way that was previously unexpected, but since it says there are many ways to handle it I guess you could say that discarding or fudging was at least allowed.)  Let me look...<br/><br/>Yep! Got it! On Page 124 in the Frenzy section, there's not one but two failed rolls! Right in a row!:\n<blockquote>Mark:  Okay, Lisa and Ann, the surprise of the sudden entry of these armed thugs triggers your instinctive training to kill or be killed.  I want both of you  to roll for Frenzy, use Self-Control. The difficulty is a 4, except that Malcolm is wired because of the drugs,  so  his difficulty is a 7.  What are you going  to  do ? <br/><br/>Lisa: I'm going to try to overcome my urge to Frenzy.  (She rolls Malcolm's Self-Control trait and doesn't get  a single 7.) Oh no, Malcolm failed.  "All right you bastards, eat lead and die," Malcolm screams and starts firing at anything that moves, standing in  the middle of the room and unloading an entire clip. <br/><br/>Mark: That's right - you're going nuts. <br/><br/>Ann:  Hix is going  to  try  to  ride  the Frenzy.  She  crouches behind  the  desk  and methodically proceeds  to fire  at  targets Malcolm  is missing in his Frenzied state. <br/><br/>Mark:  Well, we'll see, it might not be as easy as you make it sound.  (Then Mark has Lisa roll a number of  combat rolls.) Malcolm, you pump an entire clip into the drug king' s men and they drop like flies.  (Mark rolls his own combat rolls.) A number of bullets also  zip  into  you,  but  you  don't  notice  them.  Hix, because Malcolm  is  the  center of  attention, you remain unno\xadticed and  (Ann  makes her combat rolls)  you manage  to put a couple of men out of the action.  The remaining men, fearing for <br/>their lives, put their hands into the air, yelling  their surrender. <br/><br/>Lisa:  Malcolm is starting to freak and he feels  that any of these slimy druggies might get the drop on him.  Sweat is pouring from  his  face  and  his  hands  are  shaking.  (In  a  nervous, stuttering,  shaky voice),  "Alright,  you bastards, down  on  the floor, NOW.  Move  it.  Don't make any moves." <br/><br/>Ann:  I spend a Willpower  point  to  not pump  continual rounds into  the gunmen now that  they have surrendered. <br/><br/>Mark:  Alright, Malcolm, one of  the SOB's looks like he's reaching for his gun. <br/><br/>Lisa:  I try to hold back. <br/><br/>Mark:  Make  a Frenzy  roll  again,  using  a point of Will\xadpower, with a difficulty of 9. <br/><br/>Lisa:  I missed!  Malcolm  goes  nuts and blows  the man away. <br/><br/>Mark:  The rest dive for cover.  You  hear a lot of grumbles from the floor.  They seem to be taunting you, daring you  to put an end to  their miserable  lives. </blockquote>\nPretty cool.

Travis wants  to  see if he has heard of Juggler,  so  he  rolls  his  Intelligence  (2)  + Politics  (1).  Mark decides that it is an ease factor of 9  (this guy  isn't well-known in these parts).  Steve picks up 3 dice and rolls a 7,3,2. Nope, he hasn't heard a thing about Juggler. </blockquote>\nTwo examples...I'm trying to think of what other games I have that have examples of where a player character is attempting something outside of combat, it fails, and the GM doesn't fudge/discard.

A minute ago you were a healthy guy on a roof.  Now you're an injured guy on the ground.  Maybe this inspires someone!  Maybe the GM has a rival NPC laugh at your plight, or an enemy come to finish you off, or a new ally or love interest take pity on you.  Excellent!  Good thing we rolled!  Let's keep rolling for whatever tasks our stats might apply to!<br/><br/>But then there are the times when it doesn't go like that.  The enemy almost <i>does</i> finish you off, and you're all, "That fun little jump and die roll almost got me killed, fuck that, next time I'm avoiding invoking the dice."  Or the GM doesn't have an inspiration out of the blue, so you're just there on the ground feeling dumb, wondering how you failed a jump, blacking out wound levels on your character sheet just so you can erase them before the next day's scene.<br/><br/>Not a big deal, maybe, depending on your taste and your other RPG skills.  But it is a little chaotic.  Invoking RPG task resolution often is.<br/><br/>That's why Burning Wheel's "set a consequence for failing the roll ahead of time" isn't just, y'know, another handy tip like many handy tips in the Vampire book.  It's an utter game-changer.  I'm not saying that it's in all ways superior, but I think it adds a bit of credence to the idea that asking Vampire to do better might not be so hard or unreasonable.  Maybe "establish <i>possible</i> consequences before rolling" or some such.  And then tell the player and the GM, "when the roll is failed, here's what the GM is supposed to do," so everyone knows whether the GM is doing it right or not.<br/><br/>I dunno, JD, does that sound like an improvement to you?

If you want to blame people and yell at them destructively, bending the rules in Vampire 1ed. won't help you do that. Excellent point, I fully agree.</blockquote>\nWhile you keep saying 'Don't throw your game off a cliff' no, I don't think you agree.<br/><br/>You're refering to someone throwing it off a cliff. It's blame.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Given how you think you can extrapolate my own questions several times ahead and think you are spot on the mark without even asking, it's not surprising you think you know what a few words in a text 'mean' in some kind of procedural way.</blockquote>\nI'm hopelessly confused about what you and Deliverator are asking then. You're asking "what happens if he misses the jump in the example" and I just don't see how that can be fruitfully addressed in ANY example from ANY text.</blockquote>\nYes, so were proposing talking about how it can be addressed. Prepare for the impossible, if you want to.\n<blockquote>Like, let me get an example from a Story Games Pillar Of Virtue And Decency, which never hurt anyone, or damaged anyone's brain, ever, Burning Wheel Gold.  \n<blockquote>For example, my character must patch up a hole in the cistern before all the water drains out.  I have a Mason skill of B2 and the GM sets the obstacle at 2.  I want to get this done as quickly as possible and ensure success, so I ask one of the other players, 'Can you help?'  His character has Engineering B2.  The GM agrees this is an applicable skill.  The player passes me a die and I add it to my skill.</blockquote>\nIf I pointed triumphantly to that example and said "What if the other character DIDN'T have Engineering B2?" and concluded that this example "didn't tell me how to play" as a result of omitting this, that would be the same thing.</blockquote>\nI'll skip noting the extrapolation - instead, it seems to describe the fiction of a fail condition - ie, all the water runs out.<br/><br/>And ignoring if that's related to story for now, does that seem a different procedure?\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>So let's say in a parenthesis here it says "(The Storyteller knows if he doesn't make the jump he will be rolling X levels of damage, and may have to trade favors with Bob in order to find out what happened inside.)"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I don't know where this 'trade favours' idea even arrives from, procedurally. But will you say that part is connected with story?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Wait...I'm supposed to decide not just what the theoretical example in which the guy doesn't make the jump might say...but what the story in the fictional game containing the theoretical example in which the guy doesn't make the jump says?!?!  MY HEAD IS SPINNING, i do not understand</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You still haven't answered the question of how this brewery roof jump ties into story. Even if it's just your own notion of story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It's...literally given in the story up there. Like, that's the one thing this example does well.  It literally is in a story in a left hand column while the rules explanations run in the right hand column.</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\nThe answer of whether you associate it with story is just 'yes'. It doesn't need to get more complicated and head spinning than that.\n<blockquote><blockquote>I think it's because you know it's empty - it confuses hopping from roof to roof with conflict.</blockquote>\nNnnnnnobody said that every die roll in Vampire resolves a conflict?!?!<br/><br/>That's not what the system does!  The system just says what happens in situations where you're not sure or where you want some direction or a jolt of randomness to add to excitement and tension.<br/><br/>Some die rolls in Vampire do resolve conflicts, but not all of them! And not this one!</blockquote>\n"You can't just expect story to appear everywhere!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396180/#Comment_396180" name="Item_225" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T08:40:58+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  8:40AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2012 8:41AM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What would the rule zero rules have to say for you to agree it says 'just go freeform'?

Like, freeform play is actually defined in the text, so it would call back to that if I was writing it that way. But again, if I wanted it to be freeform at that point I would have written all kinds of stuff throughout the game differently.\n<blockquote>So you'd say 'normal ole GM saying what's there and what happens?' does not hinge on players choosing whether to accept what the GM describes?

I fully embrace blaming people hewing too strictly to rules that say "if your game is going to go horribly wrong by hewing really strictly to these rules, don't".  But it's not the GAME blaming people, and the example doesn't go into that, it actually assumes a good group who doesn't want to fuck things up. Sorry if I misunderstood your question.\n<blockquote>And ignoring if that's related to story for now, does that seem a different procedure?</blockquote>\nA different procedure from....spotting a blockage in the story that you hadn't seen before and doing something about it? Yes, that seems different since it's two different things?

I think there's a healthy critical middle ground between saying "Vampire was a 1991 RPG, and only 1991 standards can be applied to it" and "every modern gaming standard should apply to Vampire".  Presumably, the author's intent, beyond selling books (which was an historic success!), was that people enjoy playing this game.  So, discussing circumstances in which people did not enjoy it, and why, and what could be done about that, strikes me as germane.  Even if it's only 1% of Vampire groups who stumbled, it's still a thing that happened, that we know something about, and I think it makes for interesting discussion.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't think that any of the tweaks I've been brainstorming would suddenly apply a whole new set of priorities to Vampire and make it not what it was.  But maybe I'm underselling the significance of constraining of "what you might wind up doing with this proto-game toolkit"...?  Do you see that as an important part of the author's intent, that individual translation determine the direction of the game so deeply that "failed play" <i>has</i> to be kept on the list of possible directions?  It seems to me that it should be possible to provide a set of "do what you want with this!" that is nevertheless a subset of functional play.  I'm excited by that possibility, anyway.<br/><br/>I like trad games, and I like Vampire, and my interest here is in figuring out what might make them easier to enjoy.  I think JD's textual excerpting provides an excellent opportunity for that.<br/><br/>There seems to be some sentiment in this thread that "no game is perfect, everything fails 1% of the time, this is not a problem deserving criticism."  I don't think that accurately sums up the situation with Vampire's play history.  The world is full of people who don't like football.  It's quick and easy to understand what you do in football, and you will never <i>attempt</i> to play and wind up doing something <i>else</i>.  Football is what it is, and if it's not for you, it's not for you.  This is not a flaw.  Vampire (and other proto-game RPGs), on the other hand, convinced some people that "you do X", and then in play, they did not get to do X.  To me, that sounds like something that <i>is</i> a flaw.

I was more commenting on the perception that it's up to Jason to prove that Vampire is a great game, and up to everybody else to prove him wrong. The nitpicking with e.g. Callan seems like the point is to argue about whether Vampire is a good game, which is a confusing tack to take when it hasn't even apparently been established <i>what</i> Vampire exactly is.<br/><br/>As for Vampire's flawedness, you understand that I'm reserving final judgment until I at least read the text myself. However, from what Jason's been explaining to us here, I get a strong sense of traditional game-text writing, of which I think that I know a thing or two (as do others who were in the hobby in the '90s). Unless somebody actually points out some flaw in Vampire that's more radical than what you've got in any midline trad game from the era, then I'm forced to conclude that the think wrong with Vampire is that it's the most popular of a batch of games that we (as in, most people at this forum) do not like. This is not wrong in context, it's just a reiteration of the fact that rpg design went to the dogs for a time.<br/><br/>To explain that more concretely, David, consider the manner of evidence we have about the problems of Vampire. People often say that the game is evidently bad because there are many people who recognize in hindsight, or even recognized at the time, that their play was horribly shitty. They never got the game to work. Doesn't this prove that the game is bad? Well, to my mind it doesn't, not when we have alternate explanatory models at hand. We can look at Vampire not as a game but as a discrete collection of gaming tools, the sort that was usually written under the guise of a "game" at the time. This includes a generic rules system that enables some task resolution, a bunch of GMing philosophy that strives to address roleplaying universally (as in, give everybody something and let the GM sort it out) and a flavourful setting. In no way does the presence of these things prove that an unitary game exists in there, and considering the content of this discussion this seems like a reasonable conclusion: nobody here seems to agree about what the game is supposed to be like, exactly, and what we've seen of the book reads to me like exactly the sort of text where the relationship of the mechanics to the method to the setting is all largely incidental.<br/><br/>This latter notion of Vampire not as a bad game but merely a loosely-written, disparate one, entices me because it is a very good and simple interpretation model for many other traditional games that I know well. For example, Call of Cthulhu is a game that I <i>have</i> read and played (there's a thread out there about my experiences with the game if you want details), and this notion of textual incompleteness fits that like a glove. Thing is, I can't say that CoC is a bad game because it's not a complete game - this judgment doesn't make sense, I might as well blame a Chess book for being a bad Chess because it doesn't include the rules. If you agree that the way traditional game texts are written doesn't describe a complete game without bringing in a GM's own prior experience and creative effort, then there's no way to judge the game as a game, either; it's entirely feasible to say that of all the games that can be gotten out of the book, some are bad and some are good, insofar as game criticism goes.<br/><br/>What I mean is, talking about Vampire like it was a modern post-Forge game is like shooting at a moving target: you say that something in how Vampire is played is shitty, and then Jason says that that doesn't matter because that's not how Vampire is played. At some points the two of you might agree upon some point that definitely is "Vampire", but then more often than not that bit is completely reasonable - the game Jason sees in that text is completely reasonable, I believe, and the gripe people generally have towards the game is that it's so vague as to enable exactly this sort of interpretationary vagueness.<br/><br/>Of course even if we are forced to discard game criticism when it comes to games like CoC or Vampire, we're still left with literary tools - maybe these game texts are bad pedagogy or bad literature, even if we cannot judge them as games. Literary criticism is a complex topic, though, and even as I might have some opinions on game texts I know well, Vampire is not one of those. Besides, if a critic tells you that a book you enjoyed is a bad book, how much weight does that carry? And ultimately, it seems to me that criticizing Vampire for features that it shares with nearly all games of its time is like criticizing Don Quixote for having too many side stories in it. That's just how things were then, and there's a reason for why things are different now.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396217/#Comment_396217" name="Item_236" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T14:23:05+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  2:23PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed, there is no one true game delivered by the text for us to critique.

Like, freeform play is actually defined in the text, so it would call back to that if I was writing it that way. But again, if I wanted it to be freeform at that point I would have written all kinds of stuff throughout the game differently.</blockquote>\nSo you'd say a game couldn't have text that tells you to freeform, without using the word freeform in it? Ie, when a game says not to freeform, it actually has to tell you 'actually, you can freeform right now', or otherwise everything is by the rules/not freeform at all.<br/><br/>It's a fairly erroneous conclusion. I'll write a tiny RPG right now<br/><br/>1. Don't freeform.<br/>2. Figure out what happens next by whatever feels right.<br/><br/>I really hope my little RPG here seems a contradiction. Because as it's author, I assure you it is a contradiction. I'll write another<br/><br/>1. Don't freeform.<br/>2. Roll 1D10. 1 to 9 means rocks fall, everyone dies.<br/>3. If it doesn't feel right, if it feels like kind of a bind, ignore rule 2 and do whatever feels right.<br/><br/>I'm not joking - it actually hurts in my mind to try and think this is not just freeforming and instead somehow just 'following the rules'. A literal ouch moment!\n<blockquote><blockquote>So you'd say 'normal ole GM saying what's there and what happens?' does not hinge on players choosing whether to accept what the GM describes?</blockquote>\nWhat?</blockquote>\nThat's really not an intellectually honest responce.<br/><br/>What really makes it such an unreadable question? 'normal ole GM saying what's there and what happens?' only works if the players agree to what is said. It's really not a controversial statement at all - yet you're all "What?" about it.<br/><br/>You still havn't described a third thing apart from player agreement and railroading.<br/><br/>You're 'GM scene framing' just seems to be your alternate wording for railroading.\n<blockquote><blockquote>While you keep saying 'Don't throw your game off a cliff' no, I don't think you agree.<br/><br/>You're refering to someone throwing it off a cliff. It's blame.</blockquote>\nThat's ME, not the Vampire 1ed. text.</blockquote>\nNo, thats you saying how the vampire text works.\n<blockquote>it actually assumes a good group who doesn't want to fuck things up.</blockquote>\nThis is part of the deep problem - how the text has convinced you that someone rolling for crossing a rooftop, as extrapolated from the example, then the book burns - you treat that person as if they are someone who 'wants to fuck things up'.<br/><br/>I'll write another RPG<br/>1. Roll 1D10. 1-9 the party member with the book that will save you falls in a fire with it and it is destroyed.<br/>2. Blame the GM, he obviously wanted to fuck things up. What a douche. Do not blame my RPG, it is fine.<br/><br/>You've got this horrible approach that when people do what the book tells them to do, if it's unpleasant for the group, you blame the person who followed the book for following the book.<br/><br/>Getting back from this would mean accepting years of resentment and actual bad will were misapplied upon other people.<br/>\n<blockquote><blockquote>And ignoring if that's related to story for now, does that seem a different procedure?</blockquote>\nA different procedure from....spotting a blockage in the story that you hadn't seen before and doing something about it? Yes, that seems different since it's two different things?</blockquote>\nWe were talking about the brewery example (which has no condition for a fail) and the burning wheel example (which from the start says all the water will be lost on a fail). Somehow you've brought in the rule zero blockage example. Please compare the other two.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Nnnnnnobody said that every die roll in Vampire resolves a conflict?!?!<br/><br/>That's not what the system does!  The system just says what happens in situations where you're not sure or where you want some direction or a jolt of randomness to add to excitement and tension.<br/><br/>Some die rolls in Vampire do resolve conflicts, but not all of them! And not this one!</blockquote>\n<blockquote>"You can't just expect story to appear everywhere!"</blockquote>\nSo without conflict resolution mechanics there can be no story?  That's your suggestion?</blockquote>\nUnless you want to call purple prose roof jumping 'story' and all that a story can be, or unless you want to prewrite story before the session, then yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396222/#Comment_396222" name="Item_238" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T14:52:35+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  2:52PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, yes. For my own part I'll reserve judgment on the details until I read the game myself. Insofar as other viewpoints go, I've phrased out pretty well how the critique here looks to me: many people see the Vampire game text as insufficient, but few contrast this judgment against the historical context of the game. I can't help but think that this is a judgment borne of hindsight. Nothing wrong with this <i>except</i> in that Jason's put into a difficult debating position when <i>his</i> topic is to review and interpret the game while others insist on judging it. Different modalities of discussion, those. Jason's been quite clear about how he's focusing on a <i>constructive</i> reading of the game text (he's telling us how to read the game so it makes sense), so I don't know how useful naysaying is in this context.<br/><br/>Regarding absolute quality of the Vampire text, you're right, of course: I've yet to see a fully-fledged serious rpg text from the traditional era that was satisfactory about aligning into a complete and clear game in the way a modern text does. I might ironically say that Dragonlance broke the hobby in a way: huge need for artistic expression coupled with staid systemic imagination left game writing trapped in exactly the sort of confusion that Vampire seems to embody.<br/><br/>In this historical context I'd like to say that the way to speculatively improve Vampire as a game text is the same one I'd take with almost all traditional games: give the author permission and encouragement to write the game they really want instead of a largely conventional text designed to appeal to the largest possible customer base. The focus brought in by taking creative responsibility would pretty much fix the type of pedagogical weakness Vampire seems to suffer. It's a pretty basic job with the benefits of hindsight, really - at this point we've seen so many different games and creative agendas sharply communicated that it's not difficult to pinpoint the exact aims of something like Vampire and communicate them with much more contrast than before. It used to be in the traditional framework that a game could only ever reference "good roleplaying", while today you've got a plurarity of examples of what your game is <i>not</i> like.<br/><br/>As for what the game behind the text is like in Vampire, I think that Jason makes a pretty good case; the game he sees is something I can believe having been in the mind and on the table of the creator at the time. I'm thinking of the relationship of campaign design, plot and game mechanics, to be specific. I imagine that a hypothetical modernized text would replace the superficial link of task resolution to plot with something more honest, but perhaps most of the game mechanics and such would be preserved; the complex, layered character sheet seems to have a function in this type of game as a way for the player to express his character vision, for example, even if it is not truly key to any of the things the game is <i>really</i> about.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396223/#Comment_396223" name="Item_239" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T15:02:03+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  3:02PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2012 3:10PM by Callan_S.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>what Vampire is substantially can be discussed separately from whether it would be more worthwhile or could be improved by being something else.</blockquote>\nI think it's pretty obvious what it achieves is being discussed, not just what it is - which is text on paper, nice binding, etc. And if that's being said as a discussion (rather than an advertisment), then there's just one discussion going on.\n<blockquote>Jason's been quite clear about how he's focusing on a constructive reading of the game text (he's telling us how to read the game so it makes sense), so I don't know how useful naysaying is in this context.</blockquote>\nYou'd say the constructive reading is really being distinguished as seperate from the text?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396230/#Comment_396230" name="Item_240" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T15:44:56+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  3:44PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2012 3:45PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, I am really at a loss for what you're asking me here.

No, it really doesn't, it describes freeform and rules adherence as tendencies that can be destructive at the extremes, and says you will probably shift around from time to time.

One might say that what modest success (in comparison to current state of the industry) the variety of focused indie games have had through the last decade has basically been because they're <i>specifically</i> better games than a traditional game that attempts to be <i>generally</i> better. This is going to be a competitive advantage in whatever narrow slice the game's target audience might be.<br/><br/>But be that as it may, I don't begrudge Vampire its success. It is no worse than the competition to my mind, and I am not the judge of good and bad taste. I would make a different game, but then I work at a different time and for different reasons; a game witten vaguely to capture a larger audience would not occur to me - I wouldn't be the customer of one, so I hardly would create such, either.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396238/#Comment_396238" name="Item_243" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T16:31:37+00:00" title="November  4, 2012  4:31PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 4, 2012 4:48PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

Even ignoring the game's antecedents and descendants, it's simply bad, contradictory writing, just by the basic rules of English and logic. And it's not stuff you can so easily say belongs in one style of campaign but not another, because of the way the paragraphs are structured. Like, sure, the idea is there that there are different types of Chronicles. But it doesn't say, Hey, you know, if you and your group like to do lots of fighting, you should probably adhere pretty closely to the combat rules, but otherwise just wing it (which would annoy my modern sensibilities but wouldn't be objectionable). It says to sometimes wing it and sometimes not, with very murky advice on when to switch modes.<br/><br/>Now, I like the idea of labeling it, and most other games of the time, as a proto-RPG. But this then leads to the question, of what we're supposed to understand from the text of Vampire vis-a-vis this thread, specifically its title. It doesn't say "How to maybe play VtM1E" or "JDCorley tells you how to play VtM1E." What are the necessary and sufficient conditions of a) VtM1E and b) how to play it.<br/><br/>For example, JD keeps insisting that the text tells you not to railroad.

That was often the case with traditional game texts - Vampire surely isn't alone here, AD&amp;D 2nd edition suffers of similar skitsophrenia regarding heroic fantasy ideals vs. heritage rules, just to pick another prominent game from the traditional era. One way to understand these types of texts from the time is to accept that the authors have worked off an unitary view of roleplaying: roleplaying is a single thing, and therefore a game should be all things to all people.<br/><br/>In this type of textual tradition, then, writers have limitations to how they perceive their topics. Saying "no, this is not part of my game" becomes a hard endeavour. It is achieved not by directly cutting to the heart of the matter, but rather by emphasis and de-emphasis. As Jason quotes, Vampire actually has a surprisingly strident artistic program for the time when it suggests dramatic concerns as clearly primary. It's still a muddle from our viewpoint due to how the game carries heritage content (an adventure game chassis, expectation that players cannot truly be trusted to do more than game their characters, unwillingness to just leave adventure gamers out in the cold in general), but at least the game tries to verbalize something that we can take as its main goal in good faith. I at least am pretty sure from Jason's exegesis that the author truly wanted a dramatic, story-oriented game, which he achieved locally by freeform methodology, and which he tried to write up as well as he could within the constraints of the game text tradition of the time.<br/><br/>It is not without merit to approach a textual situation like this from the viewpoint of a constructive reading: I could read Vampire objectively to see how it <i>might</i> trip me up when I try to play it, but I could also study the game at the feet of people who dig it and get it, and learn from them how to make the game do what it does best. What I mean is, is the game of the text truly more important than the functional game? If we say that for example 40% of all people who tried to play Vampire interpreted it correctly and got a fun game out of it, then do we want to limit ourselves to the game text when exploring the game? It seems to me that even more important than the game text here is our ability to ask an accomplished Vampirist to explain the game to us.<br/><br/>This is an approach to game texts that I've become particularly fond of after I started researching D&amp;D from the viewpoint of practice instead of individual game texts. With D&amp;D the game text is quite simply a brazen lie, the reality of the game is in the groups that recombine textual sources into practical engines of roleplaying; the recent headway we've made in understanding and appreciating old school D&amp;D has only been made possible by abandoning the text and listening directly to the people who've themselves made constructive readings of those texts into a cornerstone of actual practice.<br/><br/>Taking this viewpoint to practice, perhaps we can agree that the game Jason describes to us (whether it's imaginary or not) seems pretty decent - maybe not my cup of tea, but reasonable for the time. We might also agree that disputing the text without reading it carefully ourselves is a waste of time; Jason's actually reading the original text with actual play experience of it to boot, so anybody here who's like me and only has passing knowledge of it shouldn't even be engaging in critical exegesis, we're just here to ask Jason questions. Those who have the text and are familiar with it may be reasonable in engaging Jason's interpretation of the text (in my eyes, I mean - I don't intend to be an Internet police, of course), but even then it should be kept in mind that textual exegesis is difficult, it's not something you can just score points in by engaging in Internet debate. It's entirely reasonable that two well-informed readers will come away with different interpretations of the Vampire text.<br/><br/>Well, that's a lot of text on the metatext of this text analysis, I'm sure everybody's thoroughly bored by now. I've even forgotten myself what my point was, exactly. I'm pretty sure that it was that maybe we shouldn't harass Jason so hard about incontrovertiably proving his reading of Vampire as the "correct" one - there are no true readings in this postmodern age, there are only useful ones. Just about the worst thing that can happen by not refuting Jason's reading on the spot is that Jason takes a page from the Zak Smith playbook and decides to characterize everybody who didn't get the game right as an idiot. Maybe that's what we're really discussing here: it's very important to convince everybody about Vampire being not just a pretty confusing text, but actually an unintelligible one, for if we do not, then everybody who failed to play the game well is an idiot instead of a victim?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396282/#Comment_396282" name="Item_248" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-04T23:28:21+00:00" title="November  4, 2012 11:28PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm curious JDCorley, did 1e have a sample adventure where the vampires go to a party held by Modius, a vampire prince?

In my group and other local ones, there was TREMENDOUS variance on what people thought Vampire was "about".  The vampire politics/sectarian stuff was absolutely not a given, and the games I personally played in had none of it; our characters didn't really operate in a context of total cold war within and between sects.  Frankly, all the Noddist and apocryphal occult stuff interested us way more.<br/><br/>(as an aside, I actually skipped the VtM 2 corebook completely somehow-- my first edition was the emo-uber-alles 1st, which I never actually got to play at the time [and I haven't read it probably since then, so I don't remember any of the stuff Corley's quoting; the "reverting to human" illustrated story and all the other Anne Rice touches are the bits that stuck with me], and my college group mostly just read Vampire but actually played the other WW games instead [including Vampire Dark Ages, actually].  By the time we actually gave contemporary VtM a shot, Revised was out so we went with that, and that text pulls back HARD against "Vampire is all about jockeying for control against other undead", so "my" Vampire has never been about that)<br/><br/>In my experience most of the oWoD was like that-- there were so many incompatible themes and setting elements in every game that pretty much everyone had one specific bit that was their "in", and it was by no means a given that any two people would agree on what made a specific game cool or interesting.  Which made for exciting times when a GM would pitch a game no one else wanted in on, or worse, when assumption clash set in after the campaign had started.  We had a bunch of games that petered out after two or three sessions.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm in your unlucky 1%, but all I can do is stand by what I have personally experienced with the game, just like everyone else is doing.  I guess what I'm saying is, it's easy to deny that you're in the middle of a minefield if you haven't actually seen someone step on one and get blown up.\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Your anecdotical evidence, or Ron Edwards', or any other person's (including myself) means basically jack with a healthy side serving of squat. </blockquote>\nYes, you are totally correct.  So why do you then follow it up with "I've never ever seen this happen nuh uh (so it is clearly impossible, and the people who say they do on message boards are implicitly lying)" like that does actually prove something?  These are not new arguments, in fact I think I have seen Corley fighting this fight on Usenet.  That's why this thread is really nice, because we're actually (mostly) sticking to analyzing the actual words in the book instead of accusing one another of being statistical outliers, based on our own sample sizes of one.<br/><br/>ANECDOTE FIIIIIIIIIIGHT</blockquote>\nNo one denies your experience, my friend. I see where you come from. Simply put, what you see as a bug I think it can be a tremendous feature, and explain the success of the game for 20 years. <br/><br/>I don't know if the unlucky % was 1 or 10. No one does. But it stands to reason that, if a game is so vastly played for two decades, that unlucky % cannot be very big. I've seen games peter, and I have been in games that petered. It's not like I don't know what a minefield is <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> But <br/><br/>1) I am arguing that the petering cannot be the majority of games because the game would have flopped instead of almost outselling D&amp;D and,<br/>2) Most of the petering I've seen and experienced was better explained by player dinamics than by the game itself. So, they would have had bad experience with most games.<br/><br/>Seriously, I'm not denyin' anyone their experience, I am not trying to be confrontational for the sake of it, and Vampire is not even my favourite game, but when someone says that one of the most successful RPGs in history is terribad and no one could possibly have fun with it unless they ignored vast chunks of the game, despite all the evidence to the contrary, I have to wonder which kind of theory can make such a poor job at explaining things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396303/#Comment_396303" name="Item_254" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T02:53:28+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  2:53AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>If so many people was able to play the game and enjoy it without a hitch for 20 years straight, maybe the problem is not in the game.</blockquote>\nWell, see, that's the real issue. With game text that contradictory what does "play the game" even mean? Obviously everyone was playing a rather drawn out interpretation of what they thought it meant, or relying on unrelated tools and methodology. Some more successfully than others.

I know I accused Jason of seing what he wanted to see in the Vampire text, but I think the detractors have really shown him up in that regard. Like, I'm in the hater camp and everything, but apparently for different reasons than everybody else.<br/><br/>See, now I have to admit that when I ran Vampire for my friends, back in the day, I actually ran it exactly the way Jason is saying it says you are supposed to run a function game of Vampire. Really. We got together, I said what kind of game I wanted to run, we talked it over a bit, they made characters that fit the premise, then we played a game where I gave them situations, they said what their characters did, we used the rules mostly as-is, and if I tried to get fancy and it didn't work, we talked it over and worked it out. No railroading, and no dice fudging either.<br/><br/>I don't remember reading any of the text Jason has quoted here, so I can't say why I ended up running it "properly." I do remember some other people running Vampire who were jerks. But I never thought they were jerks because of the game. The argument that Vampire promised something and then didn't deliver it resonates with me, but not because of the text Jason has quoted (and to be fair I think AD&amp;D 2e did the same thing, at least for me).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396313/#Comment_396313" name="Item_259" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T05:34:24+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  5:34AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero:<br/>That's a great post nailing down something that's been bothering me in the conversation. A whole lot of the discussion really does need to take into account both those heritage mechanics and the play cultures of the time to understand this thing even a little bit.<br/><br/>Weepers and politicians: <br/>It's worth noting that, like D&amp;D, VtM had a whole lot of very different inspirations. Just as D&amp;D was influenced by a wide variety of source inspirations and ended up mashing them altogether to eventually lead to it's own sort of fantasy sub-genre, so did VtM. The only real commonality in the VtM fictional insprations is that they all involve the vamps as main characters, not simply monster antagonists. After that, everything else was up for grabs, and they tried to mush it all together. So yes, you could have a player that wanted to play a weepy character ( Louis from Interview with the Vampire) and someone else who wanted to play some sort of secretive aristo ( Baranabus Collins) both saying they loved the game, the same way somebody could want to play Aragorn and somebody else wanting to play Gray Mouser and both loving D&amp;D.<br/><br/>"Proto RPGs"???<br/>I may be misunderstanding, but I'd find it pretty odd to call something made in 1991 a proto-RPG, given that D&amp;D is produced in 1974, iirc. Stuff tht came in the decade or so before 1974, or those odd experiments along the way for decades before that, sure, proto-RPGs. But VtM?

At the table, an average rpg from then and an rpg from now look very similar, but from a textual perspective they are very different. The rpg's then assumed, without saying so, that you would synthesize a game from the elements provided, and from elements acquired from elsewhere (previous groups, other games etc.). <br/><br/>RPG's now generally don't. If you play Dogs, the Mountain Witch, or Monsterhearts from the text, you get a game out of it.<br/><br/>You can't really <i>play</i> Vampire or AD&amp;D from the text. There is a peripheral information required to synthesize the steps needed to actually play the game. Vampire has some suggestions on how to do this, observe their advice on the different kinds of Chronicles, but the expectations were very different. <br/><br/>This is where a lot of my problem with Vampire came from. JDCorley and others describe Vampire as a mutable game where individual groups picked and chose the elements from the admittedly delectable schmorgasboard of options presented in the books. Unfortunately for twelve-year-old-me, the books <i>claimed</i> to be the complete package. They claimed to have all the information and procedures necessary to play Vampire the Right Way. They also made me feel like an idiot when I couldn't figure out what that "Right Way" was.<br/><br/>By accepting that there were multiple viable ways of playing the game, that it was OK and expected that I cut, change, or emphasize things differently for my group, I think I could have easily had more success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396316/#Comment_396316" name="Item_261" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T06:14:35+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  6:14AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, as a roleplayer, the creatively exciting thing about Vampire is exactly that it attempts to be a "generic vampire rpg". This is such an insane literary prospectus that I've no choice but to admire it - although I do recognize that the creators might not have seen the project as so ambitious and weird as it seems to me. To my eyes, though, as a long-time fan of horror fiction, a roleplaying game with the concept of "anything and everything vampire" seems crazy simply because it elevates an incidental symbol in the place of central subject matter. It's like if D&amp;D consisted of intricate treatises on the history and sociology of dragons in a mad attempt to be inclusive of every dragon myth ever. Sane as a fox, this idea.<br/><br/>And Vampire does fulfill that particular promise in spades, that setting is really a clever thing that matches the interactive needs of a roleplaying game to the desired vampire wall-mart beautifully. The clans, for instance, and how they enable the author to incorporate basically all vampire myths ever into one game without elevating or contradicting any of them. The myth of Cain is a very fitting backdrop (I like how aggressively it challenges non-Abrahamic cultures), the dilution of blood, the end-times... it's all very fresh mythology with exact, gameable implications. The setting design does a really good job in not just offering an interpretation of vampirism, but rather attempting to provide a meta-framework for all vampire stories.<br/><br/>In the light of this overriding vampire-mart game concept it is no wonder that the game doesn't really have a very strong idea of what it's <i>about</i>. It can't be about vampires, as vampires are not actually substantial thematic content by themselves. The best bet is to be about the condition of vampirism as a simile for human condition (addiction, outsiderness, beast vs. man and so on and so forth), but how you gonna make that fly when your game design tools consist of bits and bobs derived second-hand from D&amp;D?<br/><br/>Interestingly enough the ultimate creative ideal of Vampire ended up being "let's tell dramatic stories with vampires". This is something I probably wouldn't have done myself, had I this idea of making a vampire-mart game; my game would be a horror game about observing the variety of vampiric existence from the outside (human vampire hunters, perhaps), or about vampires trying to figure out their identity, what it means to be a vampire. Instead the primary recommended topic of the game ended up being a sort of soap opera - who trusts who, who loves who and so on. (This is how I've understood the talk about storytelling, anyway - feel free to correct me.)<br/><br/>The interesting part about this is that insofar as I can discern as a designer, you don't particularly need to care about the characters all being vampires when you're doing soap opera. They could be dragons and the human analogy would be quite similar. It's just drama either way. From this viewpoint it would make perfect sense to play Vampire with any flexible dramatic rules-set. Dust Devils or Primetime Adventures, for instance, could both provide a very robust engine for achieving what the game suggests as the Storyteller's main task: delivering a human drama draped in vampiric clothing. The blood-drinking monster thing seems pretty superficial here, it's mostly an useful crutch that justifies why the lovers can't be happy together or why the protagonist is better than other people or whatever else. It's a flexible storytelling crutch, make no mistake, but making a drama game focusing on vampirism is like making one focusing on alcoholism.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396318/#Comment_396318" name="Item_262" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T06:40:53+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  6:40AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, Thark's got it.

I've learned in that last few years just how very differntly my idea of what D&amp;D was supposed to play like was from the idea of how it was meant to be played by significantly older players with a different backround and play culture from the one I was involved in.<br/><br/>Huge, enormous differences. An almost entirely different approach from gamers who were even just a couple of years older than me at the time I started playing.<br/><br/>As for how different things are now in RPG texts, well you've picked some very niche indie games as examples. I love those games, but bigger, mainstream designs still pretty much follow the same kind of pattern as stuff like D&amp;D ( all editions) and VtM at their core.<br/><br/>Eero:<br/>Again, I think you're pretty spot on. I think the original intent of VtM was to produce a vampire-themed soap opera with the occasional action scene, but nobody was quite ready to really make a jump out and away from those heritage mechanics that were considered essential to what an RPG was, sothe designers did basically a frankenstien monster of design. They put recognizable Physics Engine Sim mechanics in, a couple of nods to the struggle with internal humanity (another nod back to the inspirational material), and a whole bunch of non-mechanical advice and encouragement to try to get you to do something other than a vampired-up version of a dungeon crawl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396320/#Comment_396320" name="Item_264" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T06:46:30+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  6:46AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Worth noting too that as the VtM style fiction began rapidly developing (the way D&amp;D fantasy developed as a sub-genre of fantasy), that whole Anarch/Autarkis vs Camarilla thing got pretty much dumped in favor of the Sabbat.<br/><br/>Hey JD, wanna check the section on the Ventrue?

(Focused design is in a way a rpg counter-thrust against video gaming that is in the slow process of killing traditional rpgs that rely on GM skills, patience and group chemistry.) I should also note that insofar as I'm concerned there's no hurry for trad gaming to "go away" - I might be frustrated with my own rpg experiences in the '90s, but this is the information age now, and today you pretty much can just blame yourself if you end up playing trad games for a decade like I did before the Forge came around <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>I'm sure that we'll be seeing general improvement in the quality of game texts across the board going forward, though.

In my first decade of roleplaying perhaps only about half of the game sessions were satisfactory, and about one third I wouldn't even characterize as having achieved meaningful gameplay (although play in a looser sense was of course present). That part of the theory (the Forge theoretical corpus, to be explicit) is the way it is because it matches with experience. A better wedge for critique would be to cast doubts on whether our (as in, the people who experienced this) youthful confusion is relevant to anything. Or one could attempt to explain the confusion and substandard play in some other way - I've seen youth (insufficient life experience), cargo cult situations (no experienced teachers) and general vapidity (we're too stupid to know how to play real roleplaying games) being used as explanations, for example. So it doesn't <i>have</i> to be because the games had something wrong with them, it's just a popular explanation.<br/><br/>But this is totally a separate question, off-topic. A good one, though. And I do agree with the people who point out that my personal failure to bootstrap a successful rpg culture out of '90s game texts in my childhood is not sufficient proof for claims like "Vampire is impossible to play" and the like. These sorts of eager evaluations are immediately disproven by comparing with the experiences of other people who did not face the same difficulties. I'm sure that everybody would agree that at best we can attempt to explain conditional events like how come a game worked or didn't for <i>some</i> people; trying to somehow prove that Vampire is categorically unworkable is a pretty counterfactual endeavour in a world where a living play culture for the game exists.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396338/#Comment_396338" name="Item_276" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T07:53:36+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  7:53AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2012 8:11AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>D&amp;D4 and Pathfinder, the two biggest RPGs right now, still need a lot of input/customization to get to the table successfully.

I think the latter is waaay more troublesome than the former if you're trying to get a game up and running, especially if you're a relatively new GM.  "Be a vampire" is in and of itself not a premise with very long legs unless you add some extra context to it.<br/><br/>As I said before, GURPS is not a game that pretends to be ready to run out of the box without some serious tinkering under the hood, and Vampire does a better job of obfuscating that it's the same way, because of its focus on its fairly detailed default setting.  In hindsight, setting a game in "The World of Darkness" isn't much different from setting one "on Earth" in terms of "what do we do now", whereas most games I can think of with a strongly defined setting (including Vampire's contemporaries) do a much better job of implicitly narrowing the premise so that play can actually commence.  Greyhawk is not THAT different from the Forgotten Realms in terms of communicating what you're actually expected to go do.  I can't think of anyone that's ever played Shadowrun and had serious disagreements of opinion on what the game was "about".<br/><br/>I'm not going to say Vampire had NO advice on how to deal with this issue, but I also think they kind of tried to have it both ways by having one part of the book look like it was all ready to just jump into and another tucked away in the back saying it wasn't.  And in my experience, that lack of clarity was easily passed on to the players, especially players who started with WoD or played it very early in their gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396340/#Comment_396340" name="Item_277" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T08:04:10+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  8:04AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2012 8:06AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't know if the unlucky % was 1 or 10.

I'm not saying either should or shouldn't be done, just that text is only one of many factors that contribute to an enjoyable play session.  I am ridiculing the notion that a game like Vampire should be dismissed as unplayable if you follow the text only.  We aren't robots.  The whole magic of RPGs is how we as living, complex, contradictory humans ingest the text and rules and synthesize them with the dice and our own crazy personalities to make something exist at the table.  And since the text is also designed by humans, it can be "flawed" as well.  <br/><br/>I'm also not saying that you can't critique the text for flaws and inconsistencies.  <br/><br/>It's just this simplistic (and ultimately mythical) coherent text as essential for correct play ideology then being used to a priori argue that Vampire is not even a real game that I am going to have to call bullshit on.  I played the shit out of AD&amp;D when I was 11 and we rocked the world.  I played both Vampire and Werewolf as a gamer in my 40s (much shorter campaigns and one-shots) and had a total blast as well.  How much of this successful <i>playing</i> is due to the text compared to our own human inputs I'm not really sure.  Certainly it's a mix, but it was also a mix when we played Dogs and Don't Rest Your Head and Inspectres and honestly we spent more time fretting about the texts of those games than we ever did with Vampire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396355/#Comment_396355" name="Item_284" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T09:12:08+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  9:12AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2012 9:30AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>  Certainly it's a mix, but it was also a mix when we played Dogs and Don't Rest Your Head and Inspectres and honestly we spent more time fretting about the texts of those games than we ever did with Vampire.</blockquote>\nThat's pretty interesting.  I definitely think that when I came to Dogs as a text (which was actually about a month ago), I had much less problem parsing it than when I came to VtM as a text, but that was a good decade and change later and I'm definitely more experienced.  It is my impression that Dogs is less contradictory as a book than VtM is (especially after reading the VtM excerpts posted here), but without sitting down to do a side-by-side analysis (which I totally don't have time for but would love to read, just like I'm loving this thread) it's just, like, my opinion man.<br/><br/>After reading this thread, my take on VtM is kind of leaning towards "It is not a game for everyone, but it did its utmost to look like it was the kind of game for a number of people that it was actually wrong for."  Which is good for sales but maybe not so good for satisfaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396358/#Comment_396358" name="Item_285" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T09:32:27+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  9:32AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of our fretting over Dogs was specifically with the mechanics, which we had a hard time wrapping our heads around at the time, especially the notion (never explicitly stated in the text) that earning a D4 was a bad thing.<br/><br/>I think your impression that Vampire "is not a game for everyone, but it did its utmost to look like it was the kind of game for a large number of people that it was actually wrong for." is pretty factually inaccurate based on its historical and enduring popularity and reflects the strong bias in the community here.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396360/#Comment_396360" name="Item_286" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T09:39:38+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  9:39AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2012 10:08AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I think your impression that Vampire "is not a game for everyone, but it did its utmost to look like it was the kind of game for a large number of people that it was actually wrong for." is pretty factually inaccurate based on its historical and enduring popularity and reflects the strong bias in the community here.  </blockquote>\nMy answer to you is the same as I've been saying to Imperator: I see you stating your opinion, not a fact.  The fact is that Vampire sold lots of copies-- that does not in any way tell us what percentage of copies were used in successful or satisfying play.  <br/><br/>(and of course, "successful" and "satisfying" are ALSO pretty subjective so it's near impossible to hinge an argument on without spawning a sub-argument)<br/><br/>Vampire has as many haters as lovers (there are plenty of online communities that tend to dislike VtM) and I don't see why your interpretation of that fact is more truthful than my own.  It's "obvious" to you that Vampire works because you've seen it work.  It's "obvious" to me that Vampire can fail easily because I have seen it fail easily.  And neither of us have good data to extrapolate from so let's not pretend our opinions are anything but.<br/><br/>(and actually, I have got to take issue with your claim that S-G is significantly biased against Vampire, given how many posters have popped up in this thread to defend VtM or at least say they feel more positively about it due to Corley's analysis, including you yourself)<br/><br/>I like this thread more than any other WoD thread I can think of because it's mostly talking about the actual text, our impressions of it, and how we've personally seen it used.

Nor am I arguing, obviously, that no one ever had a good time playing (their interpretation of) Vampire. My argument, based solely on the quotations directly from the text posted earlier in this thread, is that it is literally impossible to play Vampire based on the <i>entirety</i> of the text because of the contradictory paragraphs that describe both the GM and the PC agendas. Those sections instruct the players to simultaneously do things that are opposites of one another.<br/><br/>That is, by necessity of basic propositional logic (you can't have both "P" and "not-P"), in order to play a game with Vampire as your inspirational text, one <i>has</i> to make choices about which parts of the book to ignore, and which to include. Not merely in the sense of a toolbox, like using only some of the clans or never using the detailed rules for combat. I'm talking about the description of the <i>jobs</i> of the players and (especially) of the GM being self-negating if interpreted literally and wholly.<br/><br/>(The thing about how Dogs requires you to make a town is a red herring though.

Vampire 1ed's mechanics work fine for Difficulty numbers between 3 and 8. The Difficulty of most tasks are 5-7, so most of the time, in practice, Vampire's system works fine. <br/><br/>(And Difficulty 9 is only very slightly wonky, it's likely that you can play with Difficulty 9 die pools every so often and not notice the problem, though it's there. It's especially occulted if you have a Specialty at play in those pools, which you probably will for skills. Not for Disciplines, though, no Specialties in Disciplines in 1ed. (I think))<br/><br/>Anyway, it's Difficulty 2, which never got rolled, and Difficulty 10, which was rolled very rarely, that are the real dealbreakers for 1ed's mechanics.<br/><br/>I don't agree there's that much contradiction given the goal of the game to accommodate a great deal of variety among different groups.  There's plenty of times where two opposing ideas are presented as ends of a continuum, and that can be confusing if you don't have a clear picture of what you're after.  And there are some words (story, plot) that are used in a way that can be non-intuitive, and vagueness in that area is especially damaging given that non-intuitive definition.  But outright, game-stopping contradiction? You "can't" do what it says? Nah. You can, plenty did.<br/><br/>And I haven't forgotten the requests people have for other pieces of the text, I just haven't been at my home computer recently.  Before I wrap things up, I will post:<br/><br/>* The definition/description of a Scene for epweissengruber (BTW, I didn't think your question was derailing, I just didn't understand it at first, I agree having a description of what a session is like is something cool RPGs can have, I haven't found something like that in 1ed. though)<br/><br/>* See if I can find some exemplar text on Modius, the crappy, weak Prince that's in the sample campaign and sample scenario for Captain Thark. <br/><br/>If I have forgotten your question-about-the-text or have something you want me to look for, ask now!<br/><br/>Also, Deliverator, did you see the 2 examples that were examples of when someone failed a non-combat die roll and the GM let it stand?

The idea is, when you run into spots where the author says things that, while not being explicitly contradictory on the face of it, run against each other and seem to have contradictory implications and connotations, the reader has to make a choice. Either the author means their words in the plain-language English way, from which it follows that they've contradicted themselves; OR the author isn't contradicting themselves, which means the words don't mean what they do in the plain-language English way. The principle of charity says, go for the interpretation that doesn't impute a contradiction to the author.<br/><br/>(I'm not totally convinced that there's NO plain-language interpretation of those sentences that makes them consistent, but that's beside the point.)<br/><br/>If we do that, it doesn't mean the text is above criticism. The author isn't using words in a clear and straightforward way: that's a pretty serious criticism, especially for a text that's supposed to teach something like a game. It also doesn't mean that if you play the game as charitably interpreted, it'll be any fun. We can take <a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a> at his word, for example, that he played just as <a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a> is indicating the text says it should be played, and it still just didn't work for his group. All it means is we're trying to be as fair as possible to authors and not attributing straight-up stupid, irrational or incoherent stuff to them.<br/><br/>I mean, maybe you don't want to do Talmud-like textual exegesis in order to play a game. Nobody should have to!

But is that inherently because of the design tacks they take, or is it maybe more germane that, say, Mistborn is based on an apparently popular line of novels and you can walk into a game store and buy a copy, whereas Monsterhearts is literally being sold and not marketed by one person via mail order?

Vampire in their vision of GM as creative director still coming out, and being successful, in larger, consistent numbers seems cockeyed.

We postmortemed it a little <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15626&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a>, but it got derailed into mostly talking about our mechanical problems rather than our conceptual and logistical ones.<br/><br/>(oh, and this is a totally different group than the ones I've played oWoD with, I am the only common player or even acquaintance)<br/><br/>I don't know how fair it is to blame it on CtL (and it's definitely not fair to just put it all on my group either, because we've managed to wrangle functional play out of lots of other games before and since), but I still feel like we got blindsided somehow.  It is entirely possible we just don't do well with a game as "open" as the WoD is being praised for being, but we immediately started up an Ars Magica game that is still ongoing and that game is pretty super duper "open" too, but possibly not as inherently/deceptively premiseless.  (I think "flee your captors" is just as deceptively inert as "be a vampire") I dunno.  <br/><br/>I definitely have some thoughts to work through regarding lack of default setting vs lack of default (actionable) premise that began with my failures to get a game of Burning Wheel going and are continuing in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396437/#Comment_396437" name="Item_307" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T14:20:16+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  2:20PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2012 2:20PM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, unless you want to do a fugitive game, which is actually a fairly specialized thing....thanks for posting the link, I forgot about the way you used Microscope to salvage it, that was great.

I love it to bits. It's been a huge influence on how I play. I think it's a failure from an overall design standpoint. It had a vision, failed to realize it, but still managed to set a direction that was tremendously influential.<br/><br/>I think its main problem is that it was a very hybrid game. Some of the people who designed it/for it didn't get what it is they were doing/were still entrenched in old ways of designing things. See, for example, the Clans, which in the core book tend to be defined as archetypal subcultures within a micro society, and end up being used  as nothing more than "classes" (See the Assamite or Ravnos) in following supplements. Conflicting messages right there. Vampire ceases to be the same game the moment you add a supplement to the core first edition book I feel (would need to go back and re-read the supplements the way I re-read the first edition core book when V20 was released).<br/><br/>As stated in that other thread, I'm also convinced the game's success is a direct consequences of that design failure.<br/><br/>JackFractal's comment about "own[ing] a titanic amount of White Wolf material that [he] enjoyed reading, but never played" made me realize how different my own experience happens to be. I don't think I ever bought anything but the core book(s), Chicago by Night and the Giovanni Chronicles. If anything, I'd say the closest recent game to Vampire the way I run it would probably be Apocalypse World (we were just talking about that the other day with one of the people I play with who's currently reading the French edition).<br/>There's a whole group of players (the one heavily involved in/with the metaplot) I never dabbled with, and only know by hearsay though. Which must color my own vision of the game quite a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396446/#Comment_396446" name="Item_309" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T14:37:33+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  2:37PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel there's a lot of things that were overlooked in the supplements, extending into 2ed., yeah.<br/><br/>Like, what am I exactly supposed to DO with (say) Milwaukee by Night given that the game requires me to select a strong creative direction for my game and get the PCs generated accordingly?  If Milwaukee by Night is a sample Chronicle, why is there no strong direction that I provide to the players to help them make PCs and to help me position them appropriately?  How does Diablerie: Mexico make any sense at ALL in the context of the main rulebook? <br/><br/>Other supplements were pretty good about making their purpose clear. The Clanbooks, for all that we kind of poke fun at them today, had a clear purpose - expand on and detail a part of the setting without invalidating what came before. Plus have them be fun to read/appropriate to read for players.  Some supplements that had a clear purpose/position were rejected by people - Dirty Secrets of the Black Hand is actually a hell of a lot closer to a "Chronicle book" than Chicago by Night is.  There is a clear initial situation, character generation information, direction and tone, all that stuff.  And late in the Revised cycle there were some VERY good supplements like the Archons &amp; Templars book and Gilded Cage, which was all about Influences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396457/#Comment_396457" name="Item_310" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T15:24:57+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  3:24PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Most of your arguments rest on "I've never seen it happen so I doubt it's important" and "This game sold lots of copies so it must have been doing something right", which are fine opinions but really terrible arguments.  For the first, I've seen it happen and seen it plenty so I can't believe it's NOT important, and if sales are inherent proof of merit or artistic success then I guess you've never, ever seen something super popular that you completely abhor?<br/><br/>This is a dead line of argument that relies on marginalizing opposing opinions, based only on your own.  I'm certainly not denying your right to stick up for Vampire, nor am I trying to pretend you didn't have fun with the game or other people did, but just saying so doesn't settle the argument for anyone who disagrees.  I could say "Large numbers of Vampire were bought by people who read the books instead of playing them, or to people who played a couple games then quit", with just as much evidence as you've given.<br/><br/>(please don't start an argument over that, I'm throwing it out as an example of a BAD argument with no way to prove it that only annoys people whose experience contradicts it)</blockquote>\nI see your point, Joe, seriously. And I said that I had an evidence as anecdotical as yours. <br/><br/>Definitely, there are very popular things I hate. For example, I don't really consider the Call of Duty videogames true games, but more like movies in which you mash some buttons to move from scene to scene and where you never ever make any kind of meaningful decision. But I wouldn't go as far as call that design terribad, as many many persons buy, play and enjoy those games. I admit that there are design philosophies that do not work for me, and go on my merry way not playing those games and playing others I like more. But calling those games invalid is dishonest, to me. <br/><br/>And I would not call them "toxic" for the social group of gamers, as I have never met any person that has been turned into a toxic one by any entertainment product, and in 10 years of psychotherapy practice I've seen really toxic people. Vampire was not toxic for anyone that wasn't already toxic himself: a game does not turn you into a dick if you are not already one. The system mechanics of Vampire have plenty of things to criticize, but I don't see how "You are a vampire" is a less valid premise than "you are a Mormon gunman that wanders around smiting evil without any fucking guidance to what evil is other than your opinion." A group of dicks playing DitV by the book will have a shitty game, for sure. I've seen it happen.<br/><br/>The problem with many of these anti-Vampire / CoC / D&amp;D / other trad games positions is that system matters, certainly, but systems don't change people, and you cannot fix a group by playing a very defined game. Also, I find really weird that fixation to the literal text of the book, like any interpretation of the same is a fucking heresy or it necessarily ends in tears. I mean, Sorcerer can be so fucking confusing that this Kubasik guy was writing a book clarifying how the fuck it should be played. There were a bajillion threads in the Forge asking for clarifications about things like who the fuck gets to act first in a combat. Many people gets stumped with combat in BW. And so and so and so. And these are completely regular RPGs by any account, with some very good GMing advice.<br/><br/>I understand that a game that tries to cover such a wide range of premises may be confusing, hard, or just fail for some people. But the argument that "despite it selling lots of books, we do not know how many of those books were used in actual play" does not hold any water. There are communities many times the size of this of people who actively play the game. There are cons. There are LARP events by the THOUSANDS. <br/><br/>All those incoherent games that are allegedly so difficult to get and need so many fixes keep on print for decades, have a strong presence in many gaming events, are discussed, run and played everywhere. Of course, a part of the sales will be due to inactive gamers that only read them, but no one can think that those are a majority by any stretch. And I agree that most games, trad or not, can always improve a bit their playing and GMing advice.<br/><br/>I guess that I take exception at the very extremist and, from my POV, completely unfounded positions held by some theorists that some very famous games were unplayable as written and if someone was having fun with them was due to massive drifting (and even if that was true, someone should demonstrate that drifting is necessarily bad) or because they deceived themselves. But again, I read things like Playing with Intent and I wonder which kind of shitty groups you need to meet to feel that you have to take that many defensive measures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396460/#Comment_396460" name="Item_311" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T15:47:14+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  3:47PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2012 3:57PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I understand that a game that tries to cover such a wide range of premises may be confusing, hard, or just fail for some people.

WE DO NOT KNOW, and you seem to be more than willing to discount the individual reports of people who had just that experience, apparently because you have not sat at their tables.  And that is what annoys me about the "Vampire is super functional, just look at all these dudes playing it" defenses by dudes that apparently have not seen it blow up in their faces despite best intents, as I have.  You look at functional play and think nonfunctional is abnormal and rare, I look at nonfunctional, and the posts of other people who feel similarly, and think maybe this game is deceptively tricky to work with for certain kinds of people and really poor about indicating it.<br/><br/>I am not one of those guys who says "Vampire is a cancer on the hobby", or whatever, and my posts you quoted to respond to do not use "toxic" or any of the other hot-buttons you bring up in your response.  I don't think anyone in this thread has except the VtM defense team accusing other people of doing it!<br/><br/>All I'm saying is, when you are actually talking to a guy who says "I tried Vampire and couldn't get it to work", just saying "all these other people somehow managed (so why can't you)" and dropping the mic is not helpful.   Yeah, Kubasik started to write Play Sorcerer.    You would rather he just scoffed at the people who weren't having fun, like I rather feel you are doing, instead of trying to demystify the process he used to find the fun?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396463/#Comment_396463" name="Item_312" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T15:56:36+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  3:56PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand, and apologize.

Like Joe, I don't get the haters either, but then I've also enjoyed playing Vampire quite a bit over the years and there's a lot of Vamp love among the indie folks I run with in Seattle (Paul Riddle being a great example).<br/><br/>I don't think there's anything wrong -- and actually there's a lot right -- with re-reading older or confusing game texts empowered by the deeper understanding we have about games and how they work. I certainly feel like I understand games WAY better now than I did when I was 18 and playing Vampire. Every time we read a game text, we selectively tune out a lot of the stuff that doesn't make sense or emphasize the stuff that does. I certainly did this when I was 18, but I think it would be different stuff in both cases now.<br/><br/>P.S. The way we read Apocalypse World in 20 years will be different too. Maybe I'll actually understand Fronts then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Imperator" title="Imperator"><img alt="Imperator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/569/nUS8BD26ISIQN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Imperator">Imperator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396469/#Comment_396469" name="Item_315" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T16:38:32+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  4:38PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's cool, man.

I remembered it was there, but probably there isn't a chapter that doesn't include it, and it's in the friggin' art!<br/><br/>Here's the definition of "Scene":\n<blockquote>\u2022 Scene - One compact period of  time in one location.  It is made up of a variable number of Tums (as many as it  takes to complete it) or is straightforward roleplaying. </blockquote>\n"As many as it takes to complete it" (wah wah trumpet sound plays)<br/><br/>Here's another:\n<blockquote>\u2022 Scene: A single episode of  the story; a  time and place where actions and events  take place moment by moment. A Scene is often a dramatic high-point of  the story. </blockquote>\n...often?!?! How often exactly?!?<br/><br/>And here's the broader explanation from later on in the book:\n<blockquote>A Scene is a moment in a story when you focus on the events happening at hand, and roleplay them through as if they were really occurring.  This may involve only roleplaying and a lot of conversation between the players and the Storyteller  (who are  all  "in  character"  ),  but  may  also  involve  a  number  of different actions, some of  them requiring the rolling of  dice.  If it  is  more  game  than  roleplaying,  then  it  is  called  an  Action Scene (which  is discussed below). <br/><br/>A Scene is like a series of  shots taken in a movie in the same location and at  the same moment in  the story.  It is the real gist of  the roleplaying, the time when the players are actively in their roles and are able to describe their  characters' reactions to events rather than explanations of  things they  intend to do. </blockquote>\nThat actually makes a bit more sense, it contrasts to non-roleplayed downtime, which is also described. <br/><br/>Still, contradiction found, and actually a pretty serious one since some Disciplines have Scene-length durations. WHOOPS<br/><br/>And finally, the Inspiration list:\n<blockquote>Novels: The Vampire Chronicles, Anne Rice (read all three books), Dracula, Bram Stoker, Those Who Haunt The Night, Barbara Hambly, Sandman (a graphic novel), Time Enough For Love, Robert Heinlein</blockquote>\nYes, they did not list Neil Gaiman as the author of Sandman, "(a graphic novel)". "read all three books", by the way.\n<blockquote>Movies: Near Dark, Vamp, The Hunger, Nosferatu (the original silent movie), Dracula (the original talkie), Blue Velvet, Rear Window, Lost Boys, Alien, Aliens</blockquote>\nI think it's telling that Near Dark is listed first.\n<blockquote>Games: Ars Magica, Runequest, Shadowrun, Call of Cthulhu, Pendragon, Gurps Horror, Corps, Illuminati, Dungeons and Dragons<br/><br/>Other: Everything written by Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, Milan Kundera, Herman Hesse, Albert Camus, P.B. Shelley, Mercea Eliade, Ayn Rand &amp; (of course) Vaclav Havel</blockquote>\nAyn Rand, and OF COURSE Vaclav Havel.<br/><br/>LOLlin big time over here.<br/><br/>Thank you for the good words and wishes in the thread. It's been a blast.

If anything that was always my one of my main draws to the game, and I sure as hell made more Beast checks to see how one would behave with a family member than for firefights (though rest assured we had some of those, sometimes so silly and nonsensical I can't but smile just at the thought)...<br/><br/>To me, Vampire was at the intersection of political and personal drama. The characters were pretty much immortal, so the game's stakes had to be about what can be worse than dying - the added superpowers were just a way to mitigate how mean the game had to be to work, an empowerment to compensate for how bleak the game could be otherwise.  As the notes to my personal set of rules state in opening: it was a game about alienation and the dissolution of the self. On that front, from the get go, I didn't like the humanity sub system, or the fact that Experience was somehow going at cross purpose with it.<br/><br/>At least that's the angle I always worked from first edition onward, ignoring most of the stuff later added by supplements as much as I could get away with - though again, don't take me too seriously, we did end up with a firefight of four people against a giant snake crammed into an armored Renault 5... and damn was it lovely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396662/#Comment_396662" name="Item_331" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-06T22:17:21+00:00" title="November  6, 2012 10:17PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... when have I actually played Vampire: The Masquerade?<br/><br/>1. A friend's home campaign where the PCs were secret heroes. I was told "Take 6th generation, and then take 500 freebie points". Lots of fun, but not a lot of internal stuff. I can live with that.<br/><br/>2. This DexCon, Jason Schneiderman (I think) ran a game that, at its purest, could have been a larp with premise: Ten vampires. One serial killer who has to be stopped wrecking things for everyone. Ten different desires about what to do with the killer.<br/><br/>In play, it was a tabletop, and we had three players, so the other PC roles were NPCs, as the PCs were all connected to each other. But, deciding what to do once the killer was stopped was probably easier than it would have been if all the roles had been filled.<br/><br/>I ran it once, and was surprised when the players didn't see the plot twist coming (I was running the first scenario released for the game). This taught me the obvious: The players haven't read the scenario. What is obvious to you will be completely opaque to them. They're not being stupid -- you have the full story. They don't. Keep remembering this.<br/><br/>That's generally good advice for mysteries -- and I do run a lot of Call of Cthulhu plots. For mystery or intrigue, make sure you can keep track of what's going on and what the players do and don't know. If you want them to understand something, make sure they have the correct information. Indeed, err on the side of disclosure, I think, especially for Vampire intrigue, as it really sucks to have one's PC fucked over because the GM thought you could read her mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396689/#Comment_396689" name="Item_332" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-07T07:02:48+00:00" title="November  7, 2012  7:02AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yah.

You could either roll 2d10 or select from a list of different encounters for different themes/subjects/feelings. It's pretty great.<br/><br/>Here's an example encounter from the "Intrigue" chart: A street gang tries rather obviously to pick a fight with the characters. If the characters don't back down, a kindred hiding among them tries to recruit them for allies in an upcoming gang war.<br/><br/>Here's one from the "Nostalgia" chart: You suddenly smell, extremely vividly, a smell that takes you back to your mortal life somehow. You are lost in a memory that is dear to you. The traffic light changes and everyone's honking their horns at you and screaming.<br/><br/>It's awesome.  I think for what Vampire 1ed. was pushing, a whole book of these things with different themes/tones would have been terrific.<br/><br/>(There are no page numbers on the table of contents.<br/><br/>But there is an index, LOL.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421201/#Comment_421201" name="Item_334" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-07T11:37:38+00:00" title="September  7, 2013 11:37AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2013 12:13PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite "Conspiracy" encounter: a young boy bumps into the character at a convenience store.
