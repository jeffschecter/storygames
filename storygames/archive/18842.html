Since the KS didn't pan out, here's the plan:<br/><br/>You go here: <a href="http://www.patreon.com/dreamandshadow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.patreon.com/dreamandshadow</a><br/>You click "Become a patron" and pledge at least one dollar per song (there's five songs in the soundtrack)<br/><br/>Friday, in the middle of the night, I will drop links to download the songs, and everyone who has pledged will be billed per song. Patreon allows you to withdraw or adjust your pledge at any time (you can also set a monthly limit for how much you can be billed, but I humbly request that you don't set a limit lower than $5 for this purpose), so if you're only interested in the soundtrack, you can just pay for the soundtrack. Of course I'd like you to come for the soundtrack and stay for the other stuff, but that's your call.<br/><br/>TO THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT<br/>Ron Edwards did a Kickstarter for an app to play S/Lay w/Me over Google Hangouts. For one of the rewards, I made a five-track, 36 minute soundtrack of phantasmagoric prog-as-fuck music without wankiness, with lots of nods to the late 60s/early 70s era that this kind of music and S/Lay's kind of fantasy was born in. If you go to Google Plus and search <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23slaywme&amp;Mode=like">#slaywme</a>, then you can see some fun posts I wrote about old-school guitar fuzz, the Wurlitzer electronic piano, the Fender Bassman amp, and a couple other things.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421973/#Comment_421973" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T15:48:35+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  3:48PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You had me at... well, at the lovely music samples I checked out at the patreon page.
