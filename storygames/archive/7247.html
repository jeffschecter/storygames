We're talking about a coffee house, not the local gaming shop (which I don't really consider very public). And we're talking Burning Wheel, so no boxes of minis to really "give us away." Still, I'm kinda feeling anxious, and I know it's 'cause, deep down, I'm embarrassed to be seen gaming outside of the comfort of home.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was walking in the mall yesterday and saw a group of men sitting around with laptops and musical score sheets at a table. It was interesting to look over and realize how "normal" and "acceptable" it was: people, sitting together, working on something.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose if I had looked over and seen people playing poker or jenga I would've thought, "Gee, why not play at home?" and "Hey, looks like fun."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, kinda strange. Students studying together? Fine! People talking? Fine! People working on a computer program together? Fine! Lone guy gaming on a laptop (multiplay or not)? Fine! <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople playing cards? Hmm....maybe...depends on the shop/setting, right? People playing dominos? Hmm, could be OK, maybe in a coffee shop (usually ones that supply them, right)?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see where I'm going with this? It's a strange line, and I can follow it up and down. An actor memorizing his lines silently? Fine. Out loud? No... Two people telling each other a story? Fine! Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there's my thoughts. I was wondering if any of you had stories to tell about gaming in public places.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Ken                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161162/#Comment_161162" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T09:15:42+00:00" title="August  7, 2008  9:15AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2008 9:18AM by Andy.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Z-Dog</cite>I was wondering if any of you had stories to tell about gaming in public places.</blockquote>\nJust that I do it from time to time with no problem.  My house is pretty comfortable in general, so I tend to do most of my gaming there, but from time to time I want to be in a public place to game (w/o minis and stuff, mind you: that's too much setup to carry around and kep track of) just to, I dunno, be around other lifeforms. In this tri-college area, the local coffee houses are great for that: I can game at one table, the next table over there's some sort of Christian discussion group, in back of them are three people talking about some sort of science report, to my left there's a book club.  <br/><br/>Drinks and snacks are right there, and there's no worries about cleanup. I just make sure we don't raise our voices too much.<br/><br/>In general, I have no problem playing in public places as long as you aren't being a mooch (sitting in a restaurant for 4 hours and only getting sodas), or being obnoxious.<br/><br/>The chain <a href="http://panterabread.ytmnd.com/" rel="nofollow">Pan<b>t</b>era Bread</a> is another public place which would make for good gaming, although I haven't done so yet.

I've played, amongst others, Kill Dr. Lucky, Save Dr. Lucky, and The Great Brain Robbery, and, honestly, that last one doesn't look all that different from an RPG with minis (depending of course on how elaborate your terrains and minis are).<br/><br/>So we'll be in the Tim Horton's eating our doughnuts, drinking our coffee, while at the same time rolling dice, moving figures around the board, playing out our cards. And people definitely looked over, I mean, there's a die rolling across the table, we're making noise, and doing something slightly unusual, but if anyone said anything to us it was generally of the <i>that looks like fun what's it called</i> variety.<br/><br/>Also, I live in Canada, your townage may vary.<br/><br/>EDIT: I mention this because it sounds like you would have put The Great Brain Robbery on the side of the line you call people don't do this in public. And yet, when I do, nobody cared.

One of my first multi-session games after returning to RPGs with the discovery of the indie scene in the early aughts was a 3 player (2 PCs, one GM) game of Charnel Gods (Sorcerer) played in a funky little coffee shop.  That was quickly followed by a four player multi-session campaign of Trollbabe in the same setting.  I think the space was a factor in making those two games as successful as they were, we were meeting in place that wasn't anybodies home ground, didn't have distractions outside of the game.<br/><br/>Then last year, my friend Johnzo and I played several chapters worth of Beast Hunters as a lunch time game (these games are documented on some AP threads here on SG).  Our play space was the food court in the building that I worked in at the time.  Several times co-workers saw us playing and stopped to ask questions, and I believe once we even got a random passerby intrigued.  I like these opportunities for non-confrontational advocacy.<br/><br/>I also found the public play experience useful for myself in damping down feelings of "gamer shame".  The less equivocal I feel about my own hobby, the more I can simply enjoy it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_161203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/161203/#Comment_161203" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-07T11:22:41+00:00" title="August  7, 2008 11:22AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LARPs often use public parks.

After they told us we couldn't play chess there, we left (we were trying to finish a game we'd started at the nearby bowling alley, who (rightly so!) kicked us out when they were trying to close up and go home), <i>before</i> we received our food.

I wouldn't find it strange at all to see that going on.<br/><br/>My game group has played RPGs several times at a hotel bar in Seattle's University District, when our usual spot in Tony Dowler's basement wasn't available for some reason. The wait staff actually took to asking us, "ooh are you going to play games tonight?" when we'd come in. <br/><br/>I've also played the board game Blue Moon City a few times at restaurants (pub and pizza place), when a friend wanted to meet up after work to play and we both needed dinner.

Starbucks and the like are ideal -- they're expecting customers to settle in for a while anyway.<br/><br/>Pretty much, you just need to be polite: buy stuff, don't hog a table in a restaurant when it's busy, move on after a reasonable time, tip very well if you've been there a long time, and so on.

After some time, we had find another pub with a private room that suited our needs - gaming in the public area of the pub proved difficult as there was lot of laughter, banter and stuff - couldn't even hear your own voice. <br/><br/>And yeah, one of the guys used to bring with him this huge suitcase thing full of miniatures. And noone looked at us strangely. <br/><br/>Back in Czech Republic we usually do the pitch sessions and world burning in a local teahouse (tea, peace and comfort). I also did a pre-game demo of a system at a coffee house - no problem even though some of the players got a bit over-enthusiastic and loud.<br/><br/>Yes, in my country things may be a bit different. But I believe, that the reception you get also depends on your own point of view and behavior. If you act as if you are doing something shameful and immature, people will more readily think you strange or geeky. However, if you  act confident, smile at the staff and other customers, and show no marks of embarassment, people shouldn't think you are some pariah geek from hell (or basement, whatever).<br/><br/>Also, I've never met anyone, who wouldn't be - after I explained what this thing we're doing is about - either intrigued or at least fine with us having our hobby.
