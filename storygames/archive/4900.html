So I'm sitting around in the basement of the house I grew up in, with about eight pre-teen girls. I think they're supposed to be my sister's friends or something. For some reason, they are eager to learn how to play the role-playing games. I consider breaking out a quality indie game, but for some reason we're going to play red box Dungeons &amp; Dragons. They show me the character sheets from when they tried to figure the chargen by themselves, but the stats are like in the 80 to 90 range, so it's clear they need some expert assistance. I declare we'll just roll up new characters.<br/><br/>But wait... I can find the Dungeon Master's book, but somebody has moved my Player's book, and I can't find it anywhere. How can we roll up characters without the rulebook?! A friend of mine is hanging around and suggests we make AD&amp;D2 characters. No! I will do no such thing! Another friend offers me his rulebook. He'll pulled all those little booklets apart and bound them all in a big fat comb binding. But his Basic set is the fourth edition, and my stuff is for the third edition, and those are <i>totally different</i>!!! The dream ends with this crisis unresolved.<br/><br/>Fuck, my subconscious is weird.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109869/#Comment_109869" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T12:03:10+00:00" title="November 27, 2007 12:03PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate it when I'm ready to "roll up new characters" and my DMG is missing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109870/#Comment_109870" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T12:03:36+00:00" title="November 27, 2007 12:03PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find it interesting that your subconscious put you in a spotlight position with 8 of your sister's pre-teen friends and then kept throwing crap at you to keep you from looking cool.

It's for 3-6 people, but for some reason at the table there were about 16.<br/><br/>People were playing quite well, and really into it, but whenever they made a game move, they would write down something completely inappropriate and wink significantly.<br/><br/>Let's say the system was: "Announce your action and roll a die. Place the die beside your action/goal."<br/><br/>The dream would go like:<br/><br/>Jerry narrates how his character is sneaking into the fortress. He writes down, "Jackie (the player next to him) gets drunk tomorrow," and places his die beside that, winking at me as though I didn't see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
