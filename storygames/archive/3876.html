It's not much more than a loose collection of ideas right now, but all comments welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI Kick Your Face:<br/>\nA selection of ideas for a NextWave-inspired RPG<br/>\nSimon Edwards/Guy Shalev<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPanels<br/>\nNine Panels to a Page. One action (note: falling is an action, as is dialogue) to a Panel. More than one PC may take action in the same Panel. Character Moments may be as little as one or two panels, but no more than one Page at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery witty one-liner that amuses your fellow players and/or the GM earns you 1xp, and a Character Moment panel for later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRunning Gags.<br/>\nEveryone has one Running Gag (Roy Mustang likes the ladies, Gears is permanently grouchy, Misato is a slob, Hermione is obsessed with books, Blob is incredibly fat) You may use your Running Gag once per session (only 3 Running Gags may be used per issue, players may not use their Running Gags in consecutive issues) to Shoot/Kick/Splode the 6s in your dice pool on one action (You must declare what you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re doing before you roll)<br/>\nShooting Sixes: Sixes ignore your opponent\xe2\u20ac\u2122s armour.<br/>\nKicking Sixes: Sixes add automatic successes to your next action.<br/>\n\xe2\u20ac\u02dcSploding Sixes: Keep that success, and roll again.<br/>\nThe Shooting, Kicking or \xe2\u20ac\u02dcSploding of sixes has no bearing on what action you actually use it for (so you could Kick the sixes on a 'Splode action, for example)<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters may elect to be Angsty instead of having a Running Gag. They may not use the Running Gag ability, but may instead have a one-panel Character Moment. However, they take 1 automatic damage at the end of it due to one of their teammates smacking them out of being such a broody git. They also gain the bonus xp at the end of the issue for not having a using their Running Gag.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Schtick.<br/>\nOne character possesses The Schtick. This is a Running Gag that must be used every issue (Ed is short, Sousuke is socially inept, Black Mage likes to stab people).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Meat<br/>\nCharacters begin the game with 12 points to allocate between their Shoot, Kick or \xe2\u20ac\u02dcSplode scores. It costs 3xp to advance one point in any of these scores<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat mechanics:<br/>\nRoll a number of d6 equal to your Shoot, Kick or \xe2\u20ac\u02dcSplode score. Every dice that lands on a 4+ is a success, and knocks a point of damage off your opponent. Opponents with Plot Ratings (Fin Fang Foom, Magneto, Gauron etc) roll a number of d6 equal to their rating- every success they score counters one of your own. PCs roll their own Plot Ratings to soak enemy successes in the same way. Plot ratings start at 3, and any Character Moment of more than 3 panels adds 1 to your Plot Rating. Mooks have a Plot rating of 0 by definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may split your Shoot/Kick/Splode pool amongst multiple targets as part of your action- a full-auto salvo, for example. (eg if you have a Shoot score of 5, you may assign 1 dice each to the two mooks creeping up behind you, and use the remaining 3 on their boss). However, you may not use two attributes simultaneously.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour Health is equal to your Shoot + Kick + \xe2\u20ac\u02dcSplode + Plot ratings. Characters are only permanently killed if they are reduced to 0 Health by an opponent with a Plot Rating equal to or greater than their own. (example: Jean Grey turns into the Phoenix and kills Jubilee. Jubilee may not permanently kill Jean as Jean is too important to be offed by a less plot-centric character. Apocalypse, however, is capable of killing her for good because he is a Big Bad Dude.) Characters reduced to 0 health by any other method are knocked unconscious and awake in (10 \xe2\u20ac\u201c Plot Rating) pages.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may spend Character Moment panels to regain health- 1 CM returns you 1 health point. You do not gain xp for spending CM in this way. (example: Cap spends 9 CM points to take up a whole page asking Kleiser what the letter on his forehead stands for- this regains him 9 Health)<br/>\n<br/>\n.<br/>\n<br/>\nPick 2 superpower traits that have physical effects (flight, speed, enhanced vision, Really **** Strong). To use them, roll your \xe2\u20ac\u02dcSplode rating. The number of successes achieved determines the margin of success (the amount of damage you shrug off, the number of panels you may Fly for, the amount of Really Heavy **** you may lift). You may not use your \xe2\u20ac\u02dcSplode more than once per page, so bear in mind the use you want to put it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone gets 1xp at the end of every issue. Characters who didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t use their Running Gag gain an additional 1xp. If a witty one-liner amused your fellow players and/or the DM, gain an additional 1xp for it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86997/#Comment_86997" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T11:36:44+00:00" title="August  9, 2007 11:36AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did not read the comics, so bear that in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86999/#Comment_86999" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T11:41:10+00:00" title="August  9, 2007 11:41AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A number of Pages after the character's death, equal to Grief minus Character Importance, after dying, the character may return to play, and the new session will revolve around the method and consequences of the character's sudden return to activity, or indeed, life. <br/><br/>Grief=The number of character moment panels spent as a reaction to a character's death.,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski" title="NickNovitski"><img alt="NickNovitski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/192/nO35O3RI2BE32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickNovitski">NickNovitski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87010/#Comment_87010" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T12:00:43+00:00" title="August  9, 2007 12:00PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This world needs (even) more "gonzo" rpgs.

I believe it took place between issues <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> and 5 and was entitled "Who Killed Special Bear?"  It was a time-travel caper involving a return to The Captain's past.  Instead of story hooks, we had character flashbacks.  Since then, I've been musing with the idea of running episodes each based on one of the rococo two-page splash panels in issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2311&amp;Mode=like">#11</a> (again, if I recall correctly).  Each of those gratuitous and gorgeous spalsh pages is a tantalizing story hook.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I loved T&amp;J so much for this game (though I could see using <i>Over The Edge, Risus</i>, etc.) but your idea, while fun to read, feels way too "clicky" to me; too many things to count or track, add, subtract, etc.  The <i>Nextwave!</i> comic book strikes me as not particularly worried about verisimilitude or internal logic, so I want a system that really just goes with the flow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87098/#Comment_87098" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T15:42:44+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  3:42PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've heard the Official Nextwave Themesong, right?
