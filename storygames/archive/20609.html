Specifically, I'm trying to build a game that fosters the <b>Soap Opera</b> of comic books. Something more akin to the absurdity of 90's X-Men and to certain extent Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Since it's about the Soap Opera aspect of this genre I've been thinking about how to handle all those crazy inter-team politics and love-triangles etc. Looking back at the source material, here's a trend I've noticed. \n<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"> <li>A character will have a moral conundrum, find themselves in some kind of ridiculous love-quadrangle, etc.</li> <li> The characters involved will talk <b>at</b> one another, no side really relenting in any measurable fashion.</li> <li>Eventually, things will come down to a melodramatic combat. They'll blow off steam while shouting their moral position at one another.</li> <li>Eventually, the act of engaging in the fight coupled with their dialogue will combine to resolve this situation.</li></ul>\nBasically, what other rpgs would handle as a purely social encounter these comics tend to mesh with combat. In fact, they often are not resolved until that knock-down fight is engaged. Obviously, this is not always the case, but it's the kind of activity I'm trying to promote. <br/><br/>Now, I have a pretty hefty set of combat mechanics in play to handle your typical supers battle. What I'm wondering is, would it be truly crazy to say, "Hey, you know all those inter-team conflicts that are building up, they too can <b>only</b> be resolved with this detailed combat system." Furthermore, I'm thinking I could get away with doing this without building in combat maneuvers that are specifically related to Social Encounter strategies.  Alright, I'm sure that last statement is weird. Let me try to break this down by way of an example using trademarked X-Men:\n<blockquote>Rogue just kissed Gambit. Gambit almost died because her powers activated and siphoned his life force. She is understandably upset and feeling like a freak. <br/><br/>Iceman tries to talk her down, telling her that they couldn't handle Magneto without her, it's a Gift and Obligation. Wolverine tries to help by saying, 'Look bub, this is just the way we are. You gotta accept yourself flaws and all.'  All of this is food for thought, but it hasn't helped Rogue overcome her problem. <br/><br/>Fast-forward to a Danger-Room training scene. Rogue is getting her ass handed to her by Cyclops, because she's afraid to use her powers. Cyclops however is using this opportunity to do the classic training montage/help you with your problems thing. Through the course of this fight scene, both Cyclops' speech and the actual combat itself help him turn Rogue around and get her to accept herself as she is.</blockquote>\nNow, I could build in mechanics that say: Cyclops uses the move "Cutting Truth" followed by "Wise Words" and finishing up with "Empathetic Analogy." But all of that seems unnecessary. I think it could be super cool if Cyclops is instead describing his attacks with the same detail the rest of the game requires and also giving his speech at the same time. So I guess I should explain that bit of the game. <br/><br/>Time is measured in the game by comic book Panels. So characters can do all the actions that a comic book character could accomplish within the frame of One panel. All this to say, Cyclops really could be having a long drawn out back and forth conversation through the course of this Combat, because it's not 6 seconds or some other small finite time.<br/><br/>Within each panel of action (i.e. on each player's turn), players are activating super power moves to do crazy hero stuff like blasting a training droid's head off it's body into the simulated Sentinel's body. In that example, a character might be using the Moves: Accuracy (pinpoint shoot the head off the droid) and Push (use the momentum of the droid-head to topple the Sentinel).  If I'm using this same system for resolving interpersonal/existential conflicts, I would prefer not to make specific Moves that are purely for social manipulation or whatever. This is because of how Combat outcomes are structured.<br/><br/>After some back and forth of multiple comic book panels, players roll off and count successes. Each success results in damage to the opponent's Morale. Thus, the outcome of combat rounds tend to focus less on the physical, visceral damage your character has taken and instead focus on how it's messing w/ your psyche and ability to maintain that heroic resolve. My idea was to build on this and add a different kind of result that deals w/ two opponents changing one another's mind, or helping them resolve their internal struggles, or even building new rifts between one another.<br/><br/>Does that method sound like it would be more fun and true to my stated gold-standard? Or would it make more sense to have Heroic Verbal moves like "Cutting Truth, Utilitarian Appeal, Compassionate Plea, etc." In which case, players would be activating them alongside whatever combat move they're making as part of the scene.<br/><br/>I hope what I'm going for makes sense. I'd love to hear your folks thoughts on this strange idea I have.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452252/#Comment_452252" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-17T23:11:05+00:00" title="April 17, 2016 11:11PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe there are different die colors which correspond to different intents, so when Cyclops's player is building his dice pool, his narration determines whether he gets black dice for pursuing his enemy's defeat or destruction, or yellow dice for persuasion, etc.  Then when he rolls, the color of the successes indicate the result achieved.  So if Cyke is moralizing while shooting optic blasts, you invoke the optic blast mechanics as normal, but collect yellow dice.  Then if you get enough yellow successes, the moralizing worked.<br/><br/>Is that the general sort of thing you're looking for here?<br/><br/>Personally, I don't like persuasion rules in PC vs PC combat, because I never want a die or a number to tell me what my character has to think.  I much prefer mechanics that produce <i>reasons</i> for my PC to change their mind, leaving the actual change up to me.  That makes life <i>way</i> harder on the persuader, so I can certainly understand if you don't want to go that route!

It also focuses on soap-opera aspects of supers. In it you have relationships defined by a statement and a dice value. "Aah love Remy, but we can nevah evah be... together d10" <br/>These relationships are used as part of your dice pool, can be challenged to be rewritten or the dice value changed during the character growth ('xp') part of the session. <br/><br/>Roughly (been a while since I read it) in Cortex+ Drama, mechanically it would have looked something like this:<br/>Rogue rolls her relationship (and some other sources of dice) in the charged scene with Remy, lost the roll and chose to acquire some emotional stress (rated in dice) rather than concede (to whatever the opposing character wanted). Gambit may or may not have been a PC- it may have been Emma wanting to prove Rogue IS a dangerous freak who needs to leave the X-Men who has persuaded Remy to kiss Rogue.<br/><br/>Later, Cyclops had a 'recovery scene' with Rogue, making a roll to attempt to help Rogue deal with her stress (remove the die), rolling his relationship with her, some Value like Duty, a distinction like Team Leader. <br/>In your example, he'd also be able to use his Optic Blast die in a fight or danger room scene. (Bobby tried the same earlier, but failed)<br/><br/>Now, Cortex+ Drama makes recovering from Stress less of a big deal than you present (it probably wouldn't take three separate scenes) but acquiring and removing it is the 'XP' character growth mechanic. The drift would be requiring that removing stress only happens in action scenes, perhaps as a secondary goal, rather than in a downtime/transition scene. (For more on that distinction, check out Marvel Heroic Roleplaying by the same people).<br/><br/>One last thought, Cortex+ even has some nifty mechanics for handling trying to do two things at once, measuring your effectiveness at both blowing up the Sentinel and helping Rogue with her issues with a single roll- chances are you won't be as successful at one as the other and will have to choose which to do better at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452258/#Comment_452258" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T17:29:32+00:00" title="April 18, 2016  5:29PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually this <blockquote>Eventually, the act of engaging in the fight coupled with their dialogue will combine to resolve this situation. <br/></blockquote>\n...got me thinking on another approach. I'm considering the "situation" to solve is both the social connundrum AND the encounter. So, there's no chance in solving the combat without solving the social part. That sorta makes things like HP unnecessary, which for me fits a lot with the 90's superhero feeling. It still doesn't take the tactical component out of the equation, but makes the physical combat part about who's winning and who's gonna retreat / fall unconscious. Or not, maybe you usual HP approach lasts enough to use the social conflict as a clock until PCs get enough emotional leverage to get a substantial moral bonus to use for the physical conflict.<br/><br/>I totally agree that no mechanic should dictate how a PC or NPC has to think and act (though brainwashing, posession and psychic control powers were common ways for the BBEG to make one of the heroes harm their own teanmates and bystanders, thus introducing more drama). Perhaps this could be tackled by tracking the state of the conflict through the Cycle of Acceptance:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.thwink.org/sustain/glossary/images/CycleOfAcceptance_Diagram.png"/><br/><br/>Despite the arrows in the diagram, not every step must be taken, the issue can remain forever in one step for a person or be forgotten while more pressing issues arise, some steps can be skipped and not everyone must be on the same step. What matters is that we get a clear and easy way to identify the PC's state related to the issue, and then the way to achieve acceptance of whatever is up to the player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452261/#Comment_452261" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T18:18:02+00:00" title="April 18, 2016  6:18PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on the level of detail you want to put into that subsystem, yeah?  For examples: When writing <i>DayTrippers</i> I wanted a single mechanic for all action resolutions, from combat to dialogue to opposed and unopposed task resolutions.  So Dialog is really just a version of Opposed Action, with the single added rule that every "loss" in an extended conversation gives you a -1 on the next phase of the conversation.  I could do this because the system is intended to be loose and bear narrative interpretations.  But for <i>SpaceMaster</i> (back in the day) I wrote a complex set of d100 rules with different Mods for different argument types, and a table with sub-tables for the critical results of different types of argument.<br/><br/>Typically, different people will get off on each of these systems.  But my point is: Know your system and know your audience.  And when I say "know", I mean "feel".<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452263/#Comment_452263" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T18:31:00+00:00" title="April 18, 2016  6:31PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How's this for an idea (inspired by WarriorMonk):<br/><br/>Assuming you already have a functional and fun system for combat, treat that as the final arbiter of social conflict.<br/><br/>In other words, when two characters have an argument, what they're really doing is maneuvering towards combat; it's the fight itself which will settle the issue.<br/><br/>As the PCs bicker and argue, the players can make each other offers, which affect the following fight. Maybe I offer a concession ("Ok, my character is now convinced that his mother really WAS the problem") but, in exchange, it gives me some kind of advantage in the fight ("You can't use your fire blast against me, because we'll fight near the oil tanker"). The concessions could be conditional, if that works better ("if I win the fight, you'll become convinced your mother really WAS the problem here").<br/><br/>Once both players have accepted a "deal" from the other, they can move on to the fight segment. The rules here determine 1) who is the winner of the fight, 2) who is beat up, and how badly, and 3) they outcome of their social conflict.<br/><br/>The argument stage is described as words being thrown back and forth, but its real purpose is to set the stakes of the fight. (These could be inverted, too, if that's more interesting: "If you hurt me really badly during the fight, I'll never trust your friend again.")<br/><br/>The fight then resolves the issues which have been anted up during the argument.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452273/#Comment_452273" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T22:02:38+00:00" title="April 18, 2016 10:02PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good going Paul! Though I'd add that whoever loses the fight should be able to concede in their own terms instead of taking the terms imposed by the winner of the fight. If the issue is among members of the same team, whoever does the most damage during the fight should be the one getting the more and better arguments conecting.<br/><br/>Also, back to trying to use the Cycle of Acceptance: if somebody is trying to convince you of anything, "winning" would mean that you get to stay in whichever step you want your character to stay and take your time to move on much later, while "losing" the fight would mean that you have to move on right away into another step, Bargaining perhaps. On the opposite case, if you're actively trying to make your character deal with a situation and move on, winning means that you finally get to bargain, accept and reach a normal state of existence, while losing means that you revert to either denial, anger or depression.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452280/#Comment_452280" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T04:56:16+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  4:56AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2016 5:48AM by Luzelli.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with the general consensus, I don't like the idea of any kind of persuasion mechanic telling my character what to think. On the whole, I think that's a bad idea. And yet, it is very possible I've created exactly that kind of thing. So, let me explain the game mechanic this whole social+combat mechanism is supposed to address.<br/><br/>All characters are created with a number of triggers called Limits. Limits are situations or events that would <b>induce</b> emotional stress because they strike at a core value of the character or prey upon a specific insecurity. When a Limit is triggered, the character suffers a mechanical penalty levied against them. <br/><br/>There are a number of ways in which a Limit can be forced to trigger, including as a result of certain dice rolls. However, I don't want the triggering of a Limit to force a way of thought. Instead, when triggered, they are a narrative excuse for your Hero to get involved in some melodramatic exploration of the feels.<blockquote>For example, Wolverine's player gives him the Limit: Misunderstood. It is up to the player to define what this Limit exactly means to their character. For the GM, it acts as a guide. Tells the GM how to stress that character emotionally. Depending on how it's defined, Misunderstood could be triggered because a mob of civilians have turned against Wolverine OR it could be triggered because the other X-Men are horrified by how savagely he just took down Sabertooth.</blockquote>\nHow does one get rid of the penalties that come from an activated Limit? Well, I would love if it was through that hybrid of social&amp;combat to ultimately "resolve" that Limit. It would be up to the player if resolution means: <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>This Limit is removed from the character sheet and can no longer cause them mental/emotional stress. Their character has finally come to terms with that particular moral/self identity quandry.</li><li>This Limit is merely quashed for the time-being. It remains on the character sheet, but currently levies no mechanical penalites. In which case, the character has found some solace or centered themselves, but it can still come back to hurt them.</li></ul>\nOn the one hand, this definitely forces a change in the player's character without that player's consent. Regardless of how the player's character feels, that Limit is no longer mechanically penalizing them; representing that the particular moral/emotional issue has become less of a priority/driving force. However, I'm hoping this is acceptable because the mechanical negative levied by the activated Limit is incentivizing the <b>player</b> to find some resolution to this emotional stress.<br/><br/>The design intent could be summarized as:<blockquote> Triggering Limits gives a player fictional fodder to ham it up. When Triggered the GM presents them with a scenario that caused them emotional stress. Now the player can use that fiction to express the feels.<br/><br/>Resolving Limits builds fiction that allows a player to show how their character pushed past this emotional hardship. Whether or not the crisis was "solved," ultimately, the character has come to some kind of terms with it and it's not taking a toll on their psyche.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Resolution of a Limit requires some comic-book fisticuffs and monologing.</blockquote>\nNow, does that seem too much like: dice are telling me how to think? Or do you think it seems to stay just this side of acceptable?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452282/#Comment_452282" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T05:26:58+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  5:26AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2016 5:51AM by Luzelli.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> I like that idea.

Whether or not this is actually true, the fight proved that their view of the situation is the "correct" one.</li><li> The other people in that exchange can fall in line with this way of thinking or not. If they choose not to, however, they now have a crisis of confidence as they cling to their old ideology in the face of one that has been "proven" superior. This crisis may not affect them right away, but it could come back to haunt them at a later date.</li></ul>\nThis way, you're not required to feel any particular way or change your beliefs, but you are given a reason to do so. In either event, just taking part in the conflict will Resolve the Moral/Emotional dilemma, but what that means for your character is still ultimately up to you.<br/><br/>This doesn't really have that element of socializing for combat advantage. Not entirely certain how I feel about that. To me it feels like the purpose of that was to get players to want to engage in the fight. Maybe I misinterpreted that? I'm thinking this kind of social+combat will primarily happen in one of two circumstances: <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li> the party is facing a supervillain and they're being true heroes trying to talk him down or engaging in existential debate along with combat.</li><li>A member of the party has their Limit activated and the group is using some fisticuffs therapy to help ease that person's mind.</li></ol> In both cases, the desire to engage should be there. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> I think the different colored die is a pretty good idea. Right now I'm worried that my game already has a lot of tracking though. So if I go that route, I'll probably have to look at slimming things down somewhere else. Still, it's actually a pretty simple way to track the dialogue part of that exchange. I don't think I'd say you're required to abide by the dice results and change your mode of thought. But I would probably make it more akin to the system laid out above: One point of view is "proven" superior, and it's up to the character to fall in line or not.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Cneph">@Cneph</a> I've actually got Marvel Heroic lying around. Just never got around to checking it out. But I'll probably dig into that given what you described. You asked if there was a mechanical representation of a character's Emotional State... not precisely.<br/><br/>There are Limits, they tell you what kinds of events induce emotional stress. And there is a Morale Score. The Morale Score tracks overall emotional/physical/mental health. When combats are resolved, the question is not how badly you're hurt, but how much an enemy has damaged your Will and Resolve. Take enough Morale damage, and a character will start questioning themselves, their core values, etc. As such, it doesn't really track your <b>state</b>. The Morale score is more akin to a representation of how severe or off-putting your emotional state is; how far away from baseline you're being dragged by the events you've been through. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> Originally I thought only some encounters were both socially and physically charged affairs.  However, I do like the idea that maybe all combats are both those things. As it stands, I kinda have two resolution mechanics going for the game: One mechanic when the game is progressing in a zoomed out fashion. Suitable for combat as much as anything else. The second, far more detailed mechanic, for important set-piece moments where the game is zoomed in to highlight the action: fights, navigating really incredible obstacles, the social+combat fights that the OP was talking about. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say the game doesn't get into the fine detail unless emotions and speeches are flying around along with the fists and power blasts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452284/#Comment_452284" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T06:17:03+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  6:17AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When the fight is Resolved, the person with most Emotion Points has their position proven "true." Whether or not this is actually true, the fight proved that their view of the situation is the "correct" one.</blockquote>\nThis is a simple way of doing things: each person has a point of view, and after they fight we see which one seems to have won.<br/><br/>You hardly need to have any special mechanics for that, though - you can just have people argue and fight. I don't really see what you get from adding stuff into there.<br/><br/>What I thought was clever about my idea was reframing the purpose of the social conflict/argument as maneuvering for the combat conflict.<br/><br/>In other words, we argue so as to determine what the fight will actually be about!<br/><br/>These stakes can be positive or negative, or backwards or inside-out, and no one needs to agree to stakes they don't think their character would follow, so there's no "mind control" issue.<br/><br/>For instance, the heroes confront the Villain, and they want him to turn himself in. But no, he wants to escape!<br/><br/>First, however, we have a big discussion, complete with snarling and gloating and appeals to the Villain's humanity. In this phase, the heroes are trying to establish the stake that "on a loss, the Villain repents for his misdeeds". However, the Villain outmaneuvers them (or rolls well, or whatever), and reduces the stakes to, "The Villain will stop gloating about his evil deeds from now on". However, in exchange, the heroes have been forced to agree to, "We will question our loyalty to our leader."<br/><br/>NOW we fight, and we find out which happens: ideally, all kinds of different things could be possible. Perhaps if the Villain wins by a huge margin, he gets to escape AND they question their loyalty to their leader. But if he wins by a narrow margin, he escapes BUT he is no longer gloating. If the heroes totally kick his ass, though, they take him into custody and he no longer gloats about his accomplishments.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452285/#Comment_452285" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T06:51:58+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  6:51AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> holy cow, that makes way more sense.

If Cyclops' player makes a great speech about <i>how the X-Men all risk their lives to save innocents so they're happy to risk being around Rogue because of all the innocents she helps save</i>, and Rogue's player totally buys it, then some die roll or whatever that says "Cyclops' action is ineffective" is not going to go over well.<br/><br/>Most functional systems I've seen that roll dice for persuasion do the rolling first and <i>then</i> use the talking to color in the outcome dictated by the roll result.  <br/><br/>As far as I can tell, that's not a good option for your system.<br/><br/>I do think you have some viable alternatives, though!  The first one that comes to mind is a sort of "yes, but" -- the talking is what it is, but <i>other</i> stuff <i>also</i> happens, and the mechanics determine the balance.  So if I roleplay a brilliant speech while shooting some optic blasts, but the dice (or whatever) go badly, then my speech wasn't any less good but maybe its impact was ruined by the fact that I accidentally blew off Rogue's pinky in the middle.  The fact that persuasion coexists with combat in your game should provide lots of opportunities for that, I would think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452293/#Comment_452293" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T15:06:44+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  3:06PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with David, stating the stakes before the fight works well for the physical part of the conflict, which is actualy intuitive: The Heroes want to stop the Villain and make him regret his actions, most likely because their limit is something like "Merciful". The villain of course, wants to escape and keep indulging himself, building his ego by showing off his crimes as accomplishments.<br/><br/>Combat starts, it goes well for the heroes, so they get to preach on the villain. They win, then the villain has to change in some way. It can be for good or worse, actually, depending on the villain circumstances. Maybe he starts thinking of his family, maybe he has none and starts blaming the heroes, but whatever it is the change won't happen in the same scene in which the heroes beat him.<br/><br/>What if the villain wins the physical combat? Then it's the hereos who have to change their attitude, perhaps only towards this villain, perhaps towards all the villains or the civilians, they get to make that up in the moment. Perhaps now they will be more careful about bystanders, try to investigate more about villains before trying to convince them of anything, maybe some heroes will feel villains are beyond salvation, but that's up to the players and resolves after the fight. The deal now is that whoever loses the fight <i>has to</i> change/adapt, but it's not up to any player nor the dice <i>how</i>.<br/><br/>Using David's take on Cyclops speech, the only change would be that he gives the speech after the roll, and then it's up to Rogue's player to follow (a no-brainer here, because that was a hell of a speech) or take it in another way, misinterpretate of build on it further if she thinks it would suit her character better. She doesn't even has to change right on the spot if she doesn't want to or if she feels it doesn't fit her character, but still, the change will have to be effective for the next scene.<br/><br/>On a side note, I really like the Limits as indicators of the characters concerns, ready to be triggered by the GM or other players. Lots of potential for drama there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452294/#Comment_452294" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T15:19:27+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  3:19PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2016 3:20PM by Potemkin.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>What if the villain wins the physical combat?

Using something like Dogs' Fallout could work well: you have a fight, which determines how many changes (or how big the changes) you have to make to your character afterwards.<br/><br/>You might pick from a few categories or otherwise constrained choices, but you decide how the action has impacted you. This could work really nicely!<br/><br/>All you need to do is to apply some changes to your character sheet to show how the interaction has impacted you. With players who buy into the concept this could be powerful and full of surprises. It also encourages reflection after the fight, which is cool.<br/><br/>In my conceptual post above, my idea was that the stakes would be set during the conversation via negotiation. So there shouldn't be a danger of "rolling to find you've been wrong": instead, the rolls or maneuvers strengthen your bargaining position.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, the two sides are putting some aspects of their characters' beliefs on the table, in exchange for a chance to change the other's position on something. <br/><br/>You want the villain to hand over the hostages? Ok, you make an argument about their lives' worth, and you propose that as a possibility. The Villain accepts that and counter-proposes that, fine, that's on the table, but then reveals a dark truth about one of the heroes: his stake is that the heroine breaks up with her superhero boyfriend.<br/><br/>Maybe the players all agree to this, or they keep negotiating. If it goes well, perhaps one side or the other gets to upgrade their stake: the Villain does really well in the social conflict, so he gets to escalate the stakes from "she breaks up with her boyfriend" to "she falls in love with the Villain".<br/><br/>Now we move into the fight, and it has much more dramatic consequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452300/#Comment_452300" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T16:16:44+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  4:16PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking that the change that had to be an internal one - something to do with motives or morals. <br/><br/>So in the hostage-taking example, the villain would have to change their stance from "all mortals are means to an end" to, perhaps, "I can't hurt people I care about." Negotiating on what the change would be, and the degree of change, would have to be negotiated... post combat? <br/><br/>Perhaps the stake on the part of the villain going into combat is "my attitude to innocents" as a general motive category, rather than whether these specific hostages are given up. Because, fiction-wise, the death of the hostages could be the thing that we lever the villain's change of heart on. Also, it's the only way you're going to get The Hostage-Taker to stop taking hostages. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452301/#Comment_452301" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T16:31:13+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  4:31PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks great and it's giving me tons of ideas, many thanks everyone!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452307/#Comment_452307" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T17:48:18+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  5:48PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I was thinking that the change that had to be an internal one - something to do with motives or morals. <br/></blockquote>\nThat's how I picture it, too, in the case of a "Fallout"-type system.<br/><br/>The social dialogue portion sets the "topics" at play (whether strictly, as in your example, or implicitly, since each player is looking to reflect on the events of play through the Fallout choices), and then, after the fight, each character changes somehow.<br/><br/>No need for negotiation here, necessarily - this kind of thing would work well freeform, I think, so long as the system mandates some kind of change.

I <i>really</i> need to play DITV.<br/><br/>Is "Taking The Blow" a thing I permit to happen to my character? <br/>I hazily recall it's a choice between take the blow or raise the stakes (words, fists, guns and so on). Hit or stick, in blackjack terms. Have I got it right? <br/><br/>I like this model for the superhero genre. It totally solves the <i>Stats for Superman</i> problem: We're less interested in comparing the relative strength of Superman versus Batman, but difference of their character. <br/><br/>I'd also love to see this model of resolution in some kind of RP diplomacy/model UN game. Players are countries pursuing their missions, conflict of rising stakes.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452475/#Comment_452475" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-21T18:00:14+00:00" title="April 21, 2016  6:00PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/><br/>"Taking the Blow" is, in part something you choose (after all, you can all Give instead of continuing with the conflict), so you can always quit instead of suffering consequences.

Not true! Because of these excellent suggestions, I've taken a hacksaw to my game and am working a major redesign. All this to say, thanks a lot for your input everyone. I have thoughts and responses to what has been suggested, but I'm the kinda person that can't until I've seen the work through. <br/><br/>After I've finished up my redesign I'll come back and show you how I reworked things to take into account what's been postulated and you guys can tear it apart again <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>. As a sneak peak, I finally dusted off my copy of Dogs and read through the action resolution. Needless to say, its very strongly in the direction that I've been trying to go for. Stakes all around! Seriously, thanks, this has helped quite a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
