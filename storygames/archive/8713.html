We're essentially set up as an extended game day, with lots of pickup gaming, while also providing a venue for more organized play, for those who care for that kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis includes indie roleplaying. I'd love for this con to be a bit of a meetup for folks in the area who are interested. We've had visitors from Chicago come down, and once the inestimable Matt Snyder graced us with his presence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis year, we're being extra-organized (heh) and have already figured out the dates for the year, which are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nMarch 7, 2009<br/>\nJune 6, 2009<br/>\nAugust 29, 2009<br/>\nOctober 24, 2009<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd love to see more indie folk turn out to play. My host duties can preclude my putting together an RPG until the end of the day, so more people showing up ready to run games, the better. In the past, we've run <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, <i>3:16</i>, and <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i>, but I'd love to see more of our games hit the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you'd like more information, ask here, or check out our website at <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.goplaypeoria.com" rel="nofollow">www.goplaypeoria.com</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeth Ben-Ezra<br/>\nGreat Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
