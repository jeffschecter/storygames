Also present were Eppy (AKA the Jenga Dread guy) and a dude named Peter who I met for the first time. There was also wine and cheese and licorice soda that didn't taste like licorice and -- Peter said -- looked like the brush rinse water from when you do watercolors. There was other food as well, and it was awesome. I was literally in awe of all the refreshments.<br/><br/>We played modern day Afraid, a one-shot, which John says won't really hit all the good Afraid buttons. Meredith's out of town so pet duty was on me and it gave us limited playtime, and that influenced the game as well.<br/><br/>For the most part, play didn't get into any territory that struck me as much different than Dogs, and I think that's what John was saying about multi-session games hitting those buttons. I wished that my background had more d4s to put into stuff (I was an investigator), and as usual I had some trouble coming up with enough traits to assign all those dice. I was like, there, great, oh crap, I still have 3d6.<br/><br/>My favorite thing that did come up is the situations you can change via fallout. Seems like a great way for the player to say, "let's get the scary on" or "okay man, start fucking with me even more." It's a cool sort of semi-permissions thing. I think future hacks of Dogs could really explore that area.<br/><br/>I thought for sure that I would be the least Dogs-initiated of the group, but turns out I wasn't. It was interesting, from a designer perspective, to watch unfamiliar players. I wonder if Vincent has noticed some of the same things and that it's influenced the design of Poison'd. Maybe not.<br/><br/>The unfamiliarity made conflicts a bit confusing at first but John did a great job of being traffic cop. We tended to all get involved in every conflict that came up, and that kind of "who's putting dice out against whom" situation is tricky no matter what.<br/><br/>John set up a neat conflict where my character, the police officer, was trying to get this NPC to fess up about weird goings on, a very smoking gun kind of moment. His solution was to have the monster murder the NPC, so all of a sudden he sets forward a 10 and a 6 and says, "dude starts dying, this conflict has murderous fallout, your move." Eppy put forward dice for his priest and took the blow with three dice. The NPC ended up dying anyway, and Eppy's character, a priest, dropped his "faith" traits to d4s. Very cool.<br/><br/>So what was the story already? Took place modern day, in a hospital, in the middle of the night, immediately following the death of a mother and her baby during childbirth. We played various relatives, sister, husband, husband's brother, son. John set it up so that husband and son were somehow connected with a monster/cult that was going to resurrect the baby by using the grandmother. It was disturbing. John did a lot of "come in the other room" and whispering in people's ears.<br/><br/>I think Dogs has a good foundation for this sort of horror story, because your rewards come from risk. You want cool new stuff on your sheet, go get into conflicts. The key, as I was thinking above, is how you do fallout.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106581/#Comment_106581" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-04T14:51:21+00:00" title="November  4, 2007  2:51PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, how did the GMing go?
