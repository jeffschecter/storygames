The townsfolk have taken him into custody and are awaiting a circuit judge to come and sort out the facts of the matter.*  I really don't want the trial to simply be me as the judge just laying down a decision based on what the characters say to defend themselves.  So S-G, I come to you for ideas.  How have you roleplayed a trial?  Know any games that have interesting mechanics for it?  And also a third question because things come in threes?<br/><br/><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-size: xx-small;">*The facts, in case you find them relevant, are as follows: The mayor's son (a Native American named Shining Knife) had been summoning a spirit cloud to protect the town from packs of ravaging wolves.  Before he learned to protect the town from the spirit cloud it killed three residents.  The PCs found out and decided this was an evil action.  They went to interrogate Shining Knife, he was evasive and walked away from them.  Boom, lightning bolt'd in full view of the town.  A search of Shining Knife's quarters turned up several ritual implements such as herbs, candles, runes, etc.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Abram" title="Abram"><img alt="Abram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Abram">Abram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371505/#Comment_371505" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T20:09:56+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  8:09PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One cool thing I heard someone doing a while back was letting the player's play jury/council who decided punishment for the court session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371506/#Comment_371506" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-05T20:41:25+00:00" title="April  5, 2012  8:41PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if you brought in someone who doesn't play in this group to play the judge?

I thought it went reasonably well.  The game basically uses a simplified version of the Duel of Wits rules.  I made it an extended contest and basically laid out an itinerary of scenes.  The trial took place over two days and I gave each day a set number of rolls, basically one roll per witness.  Since I knew how many rolls were going to take place, in an effort to speed up play I did all my npc rolls ahead of time and recorded the results.<br/><br/>For each witness, I gave them a "weakness".  Picked either from their personality, or their testimony, if the players picked the right skill/technique to use, I'd give them a bonus to their result, but I planned for it being competitive if they didn't get any of my clues (I wanted to reward observation, but not penalize them for my failure to give good clues).<br/><br/>I like a break in the trial.  It gives you and the players a chance to adjust strategy if the case is clearly going one way or the other.  Players might decide they can't win and need to plan a jailbreak or blackmail the judge.  Or a chance for you to come up with a twist, or toss them some helpful information.<br/><br/>Something to decide is how hands on the judge is.  Especially in non-jury trials, there have been quite a few real world judges who ask questions of witnesses directly.  It can happen in a jury trial, but less often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_371559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371559/#Comment_371559" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-06T10:14:25+00:00" title="April  6, 2012 10:14AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Outside of lawroom TV shows, the outcome of the trial is rarely the interesting part. But that could depend on how you run your game. Fights are rarely about the progaonists in jeopardy for the same reasons. Generally the question is "What is this going to cost?" Sometimes the answer is life, but it can be freedom, relationships, personal codes, and many other things.<br/><br/>Since it's Deadlands, survival may be a thing in question, typically in combat.  If that's the vibe in your game, then you probably want a system to match.<br/><br/>The outcome is often known, or at least predictable. In law movies, the protagonists are almost always underdogs, victims of the power structure, whether a large company or the politics and prejudices of the time or place, and they win in the end. In TV shows not about legal proceedings, but where a character or the whole cast goes to trial, the same pattern emerges. The cost comes in with character reputation, blackmail or favors, or mom dies but at least the company stops polluting the town's water supply.<br/><br/>Usually, what makes it interesting is the evidence that favors the Establishment in such a way that it looks hopeless at first. I think you have this potential. Then it's mostly a matter of introducing twists. There's a witness who "saw it all" and will back up the PCs story. But that character is a pariah, or has a personal grudge against the mayor and/or his son or family, or is just really unpleasant and mean and nasty. Or maybe that NPC is just fine, but someone else goes after the witness to try and remove them from the trial (either through violence or planting evidence).  Maybe the town is just nasty and set against them and their only hope is a passing stranger or the circuit judge herself.<br/><br/>The point is to put in twists that the players will need and want to react to. Twists in their favor should have downsides. Twists against them should have upsides.<br/><br/>On the other hand, your PCs sound pretty damn guilty. Maybe the idea of twists and such sounds a bit too complex and involved for the town they find themselves in. It's okay to breeze over the trial. You can make the story about the repercussions of their actions. Maybe you want to show the corrupt nature of things by letting them buy, muscle or schmooze their way out (are they "rich adventurers"?) From the sounds of it, you could easily make Shinging Knife out to be the underdog. And paint the PCs as the influential. What if you breeze through the trial, which shifts in tone from damning the PCs to praising them for stopping an evil. Let them get away with the murder and see how that sits with your players (especially if some of them realize they just murdered a guy - if not you could bring in that data into the trial, it's just not enough to convict them)<br/><br/>Or maybe you want to show some Texas justice and deliver punishment quickly. You even could start with them having escaped from jail or the hangman's noose, on the run. How they excaped and whether or not the trial was fair could be told in flashbacks.<br/><br/>So, what's the theme you'd like to go for? What do you want to get out of showing the law at work in your Deadlands game? What are the interesting outcomes that won't stop the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371572/#Comment_371572" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-06T11:25:05+00:00" title="April  6, 2012 11:25AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great summary, Jogesh.

I'll check out that Aces &amp; Eights trial system since I know I have the book around here somewhere.  I think the main thing I want is swings in momentum.  We kitbashed a "mass combat" mechanic from Savage Worlds Deluxe last night that monitored the tide of battle and I thought it was really effective at creating angst and then excitement.  That's what I'd <i>like</i> the players to feel from this: "Shit, we're gonna hang." "No, we've got a chance!" "Ack, it's all over," and so on.<br/><br/>Jogesh, I think you've got a point that they seem pretty damn guilty.  That's why I don't want to roleplay the judge, because as a GM/gamer/person I feel pretty strongly that they killed a teenager in cold blood.  And what's more, none of them seemed to think it was wrong.  That makes me a little comfortable, more out of game than in.  <br/><br/>Maybe, maybe what I want to do is see how far they'll go to get out of things.  Are they willing to bribe the judge?  Are they willing to destroy evidence?  Are they willing to kill a witness?  Just how <i>bad</i> are these "good" guys?

If he wants to take it back because he won't have fun with the repercussions, then that's a valid point and worth doing so. Or if he wasn't thinking and it was completely out of character. But challenge him to dig deeper. Could it be fun to explore a character who lost his cool and did something reprehensible? He might even get away with it. What does that mean, to be burdened with that guilt? Or maybe, what would it be like if the character began to enjoy that power?<br/><br/>My sense is that the player(s) is responding to a reaction that might not be justified. Maybe they are interested in exploring the darker side, but they don't want to be forced to take the darker side. Such as, they don't want to have to fight off lawmen, or be seen as a killer by every innocent in every town from here on out.<br/><br/>Here's what you may want to do. Make it clear that this game is a safe place for shared stories. Remind them everyone is there to have fun, all the opposition is in the fiction and really you're all on the same side. Make this promise explicit to your players. Ask them not to shy away from this because you're really interested in going this way, and sell them on how compelling and enjoyable you think it will be. And ask from them to give you firm boundaries so that you know what they're looking for to make it fun.  Even though it sounds like the player of the killer is the only one having a big problem with it, this is still something the table should agree on and consider as the audience and creators of an interesting story, not as agents of their characters trying to ensure they have blissful lives of peace and prosperity.<br/><br/>Even if the killer's player absolutely doesn't want the action in his past, then he still might be interested in exploring his character's temper and temptation to kill as an easy solution to messy and dangerous problems. But don't push too hard, this doesn't need to be therapeutic, nor should it be challenging and uncomfortable if it's outside of the player's comfort zone for play.<br/><br/>And this might go without saying, but this is almost certainly a conversation to have with the group in person - or at the very least a video conference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
