This is prob my favorite thing about the game, all of those little things that every GM does normally are codified and made the only rules that the MC gets to do in the game. I really dig that. <br/><br/>That said, my advice for a best practice is this - as MC everything you say is either a move or something that leads to you or one of the players making a move. Everything. This is spelled out much better in the final text, but it is definitely something to keep in mind.<br/><br/>edit to add a link: Here is a thread with where I worked out my issue on the game which lead to the above:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11911" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11911</a><br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285236/#Comment_285236" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T11:28:37+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 11:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, of course you have cut through my snark with a sensible suggestion!<br/><br/>(I hope everyone knows I was *totally* not being bitchy, just snarky.)<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285244/#Comment_285244" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T12:01:27+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 12:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, my best advice for AW is just to do what it says in the book.  That's actually pretty different than what happens when you play D&amp;D or some other games, right, where you -- or I at least -- generally start by assuming I know more about good roleplaying than the book does and look for the book to build on what I already know how to do.  For AW, the book very clearly tells you how to run it, what to do when you don't know what to do (make an MC move!), and the rest.<br/><br/>In every instance where someone has had a problem running AW (or where I've had a problem understanding AW), it generally seems to revolve around people not doing or not reading carefully the stuff that's actually in the book.  This isn't to say that there couldn't be best practices that aren't encoded clearly in the book -- theoretically that could be the case -- but AW has encoded its best practices in the text better than most RPGs.  The principles, GM moves, list of things to do, etc.  They are all gold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285245/#Comment_285245" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T12:04:24+00:00" title="August 10, 2010 12:04PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2010 12:09PM by nemomeme.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are pretty much from the playtest period but may be helpful:<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11911&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11911&amp;page=1</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11502&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11502&amp;page=1</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12219&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12219&amp;page=1</a><br/><br/>The what's cool thread at the AW forums is a good compass towards some of what you're looking for too:<br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=9.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=9.0</a><br/><br/>It's difficult to boil down the best practices because the primary text is so good and a lot of the supplementary advice that's come after is like: <br/>"This didn't work!"

These are all in the rules but are parts tha I tripped over. I hope to run more campaigns to totally utilize what I've picked up:<br/><br/>- Ask more questions. The book tells you to ask questions and give the players room to answer. I wish I'd done this more. GMing impulses and traditional authority setups will leave people looking to you to fill in setting details, and your impulse will be to do that. Look for more opportunities to have the players fill in those gaps rather than doing it yourself. Do this as much as possible.<br/><br/>- Make all NPCs Threats. After the first game you'll have a bunch of NPCs. They all need to be Threats. Do not handwave this. If you're like, "Well, they don't seem to belong to any of these Threat types," either make them a member of a Warlord's cast and make the Warlord the Threat, make them a Brute and figure out a larger group that the NPC belongs to that's a Threat. After every game when an NPC is introduced, go through after the game and make sure they are Threats.<br/><br/>- Wait. Make <b>everything</b> a Threat. Think about all aspects of your world as threats. The town the PCs live in? Landscape threat. That religious belief that came up in play? That's an Affliction - Delusion. The strange characters that populate the Psychic Maelstrom? Threat. The Psychic Maelstrom? That's a Threat too.<br/><br/>- Fill out the world with your Fronts. Different people have different numbers of Fronts that work for them. I generally have three - one that's fully manifesting, one that's being hinted at, and one in the back of the fridge. In each Front you're supposed to have four Threats. To begin with you'll maybe only be able to stick one or two existing Threats in there, so make sure to fill it out with two or three Threats that you've made up. Spin up a Warlord nearby, a Grotesque lurking in the town tht nobody realizes, etc. Once you've been playing for a bit though and if you follow the last two steps, you'll have more than enough Threats. Still, leave maybe one spot in each Front open to introduce something new.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285386/#Comment_285386" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T05:50:54+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  5:50AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pedyo</cite>Has any European-types (like myself) received the book yet?<br/>I'm suddenly not that patient anymore <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Peter</blockquote>\nNopers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve%20H" title="Steve H"><img alt="Steve H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve%20H">Steve H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285403/#Comment_285403" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T06:42:36+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  6:42AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read on the AW forum that international orders were shipping out by the end of this week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285427/#Comment_285427" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T08:30:36+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  8:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great post, Bret!

A dust storm, flocks of blood drinking birds, slavers, a cannibal - all of those have reasons to get all up in the PCs shit and all you have to do is a make a move with them to cause problems, and usually "announce future badness" or "announce offscreen badness" are the best way to start.<br/><br/>So really that's exactly how you handle it, or you can make another move, but you don't really do it any other way. Maybe make a custom move or something.<br/><br/>If they're not interested in it, then that's fine. Advance it along the countdown timer. Eventually it'll reach its full expression and they have to deal with that. Usually, though, the full expression is something they shouldn't want to see happen. And don't be nervous about not being ready. Just have some Fronts hanging around with Threats ready to go nuts.

A Threat can be a disease causing people to slowly deteriorate, or a dangerous cult slowly growing, or people eating way too much and using up all the food, etc.<br/><br/>So there's a lot going on, and usually a lot for players to choose to deal with depending on interest/urgency. And also one important thing is "when the players look at you waiting for you to say something, make a move." However, when they have shit they want to do and are like I GO THERE, I DO THIS, etc. then roll with it.

That's like taking over a holding in the fiction, which gives you, mechanically, a holding, just as if you've spent an advance and taken a move from the Hardholder playbook.  Basically, you can treat a lot of specialized moves as having "when you are in a situation when it would make sense that you would be able to use this move" in front of them.  Am I reading you right, John?<br/><br/>EDIT: Actually, it's more like: "when you have fulfilled the fictional conditions necessary for making a move, make that move."

The Wealth move comes with having a holding, but the Leadership move comes with <i>being a Hardholder</i>.

But if you've already seized the gang by force, and have chosen "take definite hold," it's your gang now, right?  I mean, it depends on the context, definitely.  Sometimes waiting for the players to make normal moves is fine (actually, it's almost always fine).  But sometimes asking the players to make moves after they've already nailed rolls is kinda lame.  Like if I've JUST successfully seized the gang and say, "Okay, you fuckers, line up and shoot towards those other fuckers!"  ... making me roll Seduce/Manipulate kinda sucks.  Did I seize them or didn't I?<br/><br/>Mark, yeah, hardholds are made of NPCs.  So, yeah, of course they're also potentially a Front (or multiple Fronts).  And if you want the gang to be especially hard to govern you could also talk on +savagery or/and few active Wants.  My operator, Lafferty, seized an island full of cannibals once and ended up with a bunch of starving humans kept as meat that gave his new hardhold Want: Starvation, right off the bat.

Everyone just got it immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book may already cover this but the only thing I can see to be aware of are the class combos. Certain combination of character classes seem easier for a new group. For example, having classes like the Hard Holder involved makes running the game practically run itself and can tie PCs together. Making a Hard Holder involves picking from lists of options to define your home, wants, and as a result cooks in a series of threat options. The Hard Holder even has moves that they make at the start of the game that cause trouble immediately. Same for the Operator, Chopper and I'm sure other classes. Where a group consisting of an Angel and a Driver might be slightly (and I stress only slightly) more challenging although still very fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen again, take everything I say here with a grain of salt.

I don't know, balancing a straight-up bestowal of a move, particularly out of someone else's playbook, without spending the XP. So like "You have a gang. But first you'll have to figure out how to keep them from raping and eating everything they come across" would be suitable but 'Hey you're a Pack Alpha now!" feels capricious.<br/><br/>* EDIT: <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=297.15" rel="nofollow">In another thread</a>, Vincent also (to my mind very sensibly) points out "You can have a gang without having either leadership or pack alpha, just like you can have a car without being a no shit driver or you can have violation gloves without having any brainer moves.

When you buy a gang and <i>pack alpha</i> with improvement, the MC goes, "Okay, cool. How do you get a gang? Who are they? How do you keep them in line?"<br/><br/>When the Gunlugger seizes a gang by force and takes definite hold of it, and then lays down the law and makes an example of a few of them, the MC <i>is allowed to</i> say "Okay, cool. Let's figure out the gang profile from the options here, to reflect this new bunch of savages you have under your thumb. And you totally have <i>pack alpha</i> right now."<br/><br/>Follow the fiction, make Apocalypse World seem real, make the players' characters' lives not boring.

Seems that way over on the AW forum as well. I get that: we're dealing with people here, not gear or special magick powerz or a hold. It's also slightly mindboggling that "seize by force" is so very, very all-purpose: I could seize your gun, or your life, or your hold, or your car, or your gang all with the same single roll. Whoa!<br/><br/>So I think the existence of this amazing wondermove is what facilitates a whole range of moves that feel like they should be a bit more ... proprietary to a given character. Hardholders have holds, drivers have cars, choppers have gangs...but one roll later, you can blow right past their niche protection.<br/><br/>Not arguing one way or t'other, just making an observation.<br/><br/>(And then there are moves I can't see being really susceptible to "seize by force." Anything psychic seems non-seizable, for example. Ditto gigs, but then again...! I suppose you could make that possible with something like "so you kick the shit out of so-and-so's crew running security for the local warlord, and when you show up with a bagful of heads he hires you on the spot".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285890/#Comment_285890" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T13:19:40+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  1:19PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can just jack control of someone's gang from them using Seize By Force but it doesn't make you their Leader or Pack Alpha, right?

I think if the fiction lends itself to a move getting revoked, it gets revoked.

Like, "I'm a thief, you can't take my Backstab away from me."

And there's been some loyalty issues of late. Notably, Roarke's been poaching my girls, makin' double agents of them in exchange for ammo and valuables.<br/><br/>So I hold a meeting, and I have one of the traitors as a human sacrifice. I'm telling the girls that we ain't The Ladies no more - we're The Watchful. And I open my coat, to reveal the giant watchful eye image that I've cut into my collarbone/chest. I try to get the new recruit to shoot the traitor, to prove her dedication to The Watchful. I go pack alpha, because the recruit doesn't want to do it. I fuck up the roll.<br/><br/>And this gleam enters the eye of my lieutenant. She's taking this Watchful business very seriously - much more seriously than me. After carving a bloody eye into her own chest, she wrestles the gun out of the recruit's hands, labels her a traitor, and shoots her. Oh, and shoots the original traitor, too.<br/><br/>And John, the MC, informs me that I just lost control of my gang. I might have been queen of the Ladies, but I'm not the leader of the Watchful. I lost that right. Gone in a single roll. Well, really - gone in a single roll that emerged from a big, giant, precarious situation that I established. Was it fair? Definitely. There are no status quo's in Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it set me up for a great character arc - Snakebone manipulating the new leader, convincing her to head into volatile situations, pressuring the new direction the gang was headed in, readying herself to try and use<i> pack alpha</i> again (as, after all, the move was still on my sheet). Ultimately, I think Snakebone took control back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285940/#Comment_285940" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T14:42:17+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  2:42PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Roarke's been poaching my girls</blockquote>\nI love how Roarke gets around.

If a character doesn't have Pack Alpha, of course you don't have to give it to them. They can use some other move to get their gang to do stuff, if they can figure out how to actually do it in the fiction and have it work on the gang. If not, then there's no roll and you just tell them what the gang does, after you think to yourself, "what would this gang do when somebody who doesn't have leadership and isn't a pack alpha tells them to do something?" Whatever you think that is, that's what happens.<br/><br/>If the player wants to be able to actually impose his will on the gang, and not have to put up with your pain-in-the-ass interpretation of who they are, they can spend an advance and buy the move.<br/><br/>And addressing it from the standpoint of the fiction, just because somebody orders some dudes around, that doesn't make him a leader. Just because he's willing to beat them up if they don't do what he says, that doesn't make him a pack alpha. If I, the player, look you, the MC, straight in the eye, and say "I'm ice cold. My heart is a black piece of coal and I don't even flinch for nuthin," are you going to let me roll+cool when I'm acting under fire? No, that's bullshit. Same thing. You're not a pack alpha... until you are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285948/#Comment_285948" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T15:25:44+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  3:25PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's pretty much how I'd handle it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285955/#Comment_285955" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T16:29:54+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  4:29PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Partly, it also depends on how often you want to roll for stuff. It felt, to me, like the playtest version really restricted how often you could actually use a move and roll the dice. Like, shooting a dude wasn't a move, you'd just do it, where now any act of violence is going aggro or seizing by force. When we first started playing, I wanted players to roll for sneaking into a room, or fixing the broken van. I think as gamers we're used to that: you want to do something iffy? Roll for it. In that case, you could even go so far as to use Vincent's meta-move, where you pick a stat and roll, with 10+ you do it,and 7-9 you do it but shit happens too, etc. And just let teh fiction handle everything else.<br/><br/>Or, stick to the moves, and play it as written, but in that case, you as MC need to be comfortable with just deciding certain things, and saying "yes, you can fix the van, it will take you an hour," and "you tell your guys to fight Roark? No way, they throw down their guns, they won't do it." If you're good with that, then cool, do like I say above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285956/#Comment_285956" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T16:32:59+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  4:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2010 4:34PM by Mcdaldno.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Or, stick to the moves, and play it as written, but in that case, you as MC need to be comfortable with just deciding certain things, and saying "yes, you can fix the van, it will take you an hour,"</blockquote>\nI think that a best practice there might be "you want to fix the van?

All totally solid advice!<br/><br/>I think the only "complaint"-slash-concern I heard all night was that there were implications attached to some of the basic Moves that aren't clear from reading the trifold. Like the fact that Seize by Force <i>always</i> means taking harm, for example. I think there are lots of implied negatives in the way the "choose X" lists are written, but it's not especially rigorous so we'll be checking every Move's entry for a little while.<br/><br/>Other than that? Play itself seemed to move pretty organically. I'm left with an okay-ish list of prompts from our first round of questions, enough that I'll be able to do Bret's "immediate/pending/backburner Front" thing but not so much that it wrote itself. Procedural question: does the MC keep those Fronts close to the vest, or is this an all-share-all-the-time game? Does the MC keep secrets?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286067/#Comment_286067" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T10:03:17+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 10:03AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, going hand in hand with the whole "misdirect" and "don't speak it's name" stuff, I'd keep the Fronts and Threats secret.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286069/#Comment_286069" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T10:05:09+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 10:05AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Except to the Brainer of course. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286071/#Comment_286071" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T10:08:47+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 10:08AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on what you mean, Paul.

However, I've found that it's perfectly reasonable for a situation to be established at 0 harm. If I'm just trying to push someone out of the way or otherwise restrain them without hurting them, that could be 0 harm.<br/><br/>But yeah, Seize by Force is only used when they're fighting back.

For example, I was thinking about the game we just finished (?) and where I can see the MC's fingers on things as at least a co-author.  What I came up with was:<br/><br/>-- creating Fronts and NPCs<br/>-- drawing maps like crazy (though players can draw maps too)<br/>-- playing Fronts and NPCs (including making Front and MC moves)<br/>-- making hard moves against the characters (like "you end up on the ground while the battle rages around you, someone steps on your face")<br/>-- barf forth apocalyptica<br/>-- playing the Psychic Maelstrom (this is a big one, especially with leading questions like: "what are you gonna do to get back at those fuckers?")<br/>-- etc.<br/><br/>Basically, there's a lot of places where the MC really does get their hands dirty and helps shape the fiction.  It's not this totally removed thing.  There are many, many moments when the MC is hip deep in the story and really making it boil.  But you gotta get in there and do that, instead of sitting back and "authoring," if you get what I mean.  Take that with a grain of salt because I haven't run it yet, just watched John and Tony run AW and Apocalypse D&amp;D.  So some other folks probably have better thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286907/#Comment_286907" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T04:31:15+00:00" title="August 17, 2010  4:31AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To weigh in on the "do you tell players about fronts" question, I'd say basically "no", with some caveats. First off, doesn't the book flat out say "don't show your front sheet to the players"? Obviously that's a separate question from telling them "about" the fronts, and I think that's more covered, as someone said above, by misdirection and cloaking your moves. It may quickly become obvious that they're dealing with a warlord or a disease (in the real world meanings of the words) but unless they're AW MCs themselves, they may not anticipate the particular moves associated with those threat types.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack" title="Jon Slack"><img alt="Jon Slack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/512/nUS4FIM85ZXII.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Slack">Jon Slack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286935/#Comment_286935" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T09:04:26+00:00" title="August 17, 2010  9:04AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to talk about the moves after the game, mostly because I'm so excited and thrilled at how much fun it makes MCing the game, and I want to share some of the nuts and bolts on how the fiction was shaped and created.  But I try not to talk about it during the game, because it takes everyone out of the moment.  The game rules on moves say "Misdirect" and "Never speak it's name", and I think this is important, because it avoids the twitchy vibe that Paul is talking about. <br/><br/>In terms of success and failure, Burning Wheel and Apocalypse world play in a similar fashion. Burning Wheel has the concept of "two directions" for the fiction to proceed when rolling, whether you pass the roll or fail the roll. In AW you have three directions for fiction: pass, pass with some failure, and failure.  In AW you actually have a list of moves to help you figure out what happens after you roll, but, similar to Burning Wheel, you need to make it logical from the fiction.  <br/><br/>Misdirect is all about keeping a move loyal to the game fiction, and keeping it to events happening in game, and "never speak it's name" keeps the fiction flowing smoothly.  I look at it as cause and effect: a player does something, and this thing happens, so they do something in response, and then that other thing happens.  The cause and effect, staying to the fiction in the game, is really important, and makes for a much smoother game experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12694/aw-apoc-world-best-practices-i-dont-care-if-it-came-to-you-in-the-mail-or-not" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12694/aw-apoc-world-best-practices-i-dont-care-if-it-came-to-you-in-the-mail-or-not" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12694/aw-apoc-world-best-practices-i-dont-care-if-it-came-to-you-in-the-mail-or-not/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12694%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12694%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
