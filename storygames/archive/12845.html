I don't think I've seen it discussed here at Story Games yet. <br/><br/>Caveat would be that it's really intended for 1 GM (World) and 1 player (hero), so it may not be extensible enough for you if you're looking to run with 3. The author has some rules variations that support this on his blog, but says he doesn't really recommend them <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>. The other caveat based on your requirements is that it uses playing cards instead of D6, but if your issue is newbie accessibility or having dice readily available, then cards might be a plus.<br/><br/>I picked up and and it's really intrigued me. It's very much a cooperate story telling game (establish scenes, resolve conflicts within those scenes), but there's a bit of a competitive vibe and the mechanics make it all feel a little less hand wavy. Basically, you establish the world and the character(s), the world player sets up the locations and conflicts, and the hero player kicks off the first scene. The world player then uses his list of conflicts for that location to narrate challenges based on a draw of cards. Conflicts will have an impact level based on the severity of the challenge and the cards available. The hero player tries to counter that impact level with his own cards and character abilities, and then narrates the result. It's a nice mix of structure and free-form.<br/><br/>Art and layout is definitely small press, but the content is cool and the author has been very active via his blog and the semi-official Yahoo group forums.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289244/#Comment_289244" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T13:52:05+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  1:52PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/games.html" rel="nofollow">Breaking the Ice or Shooting the Moon</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SimpliCity" title="SimpliCity"><img alt="SimpliCity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SimpliCity">SimpliCity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289246/#Comment_289246" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T14:33:06+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  2:33PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the suggestions so far!<br/>\nFrom the suggestions I've gotten thus far, I've heard about Dresden Files and Mouse Guard, both of which sound a bit too crunchy for my current tastes.<br/>\nI downloaded Synapse earlier (it was what sparked the discussion with my girlfriend, actually), but haven't read it through yet.<br/>\nSwashbucklers of the Seven Skies sounds like a great setting, with exactly the elements I'd like.

It's a single scenario that, at a leisurely pace, may take a while to complete. <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/89" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/89</a><br/><br/><i>Solar System</i>/<i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> would work, but it requires special dice. Better for three than for two, though.<br/><br/>If there's three of you, the possibilities _explode_. Consider <i>Polaris</i> (though there's no PDF of it) or <i>Anima Prime</i> (maybe not at it's best for three? but it's free on <a href="http://www.animaprimerpg.com/main/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.animaprimerpg.com/main/</a> so check out for yourself).<br/><br/>EDIT: I only listed games with very little to just a little crunch, C. Griffen's games and Solar System being the the crunchiest of the bunch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289269/#Comment_289269" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T17:31:44+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  5:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and, how could I forget? <i>Apocalypse World</i> can also work for three.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289271/#Comment_289271" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T17:43:39+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  5:43PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite><i>Apocalypse World</i>can also work for three.</blockquote>\nI've been playing this one-on-one with my wife and one-on-three with my regular group; both great games.
