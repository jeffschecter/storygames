Ask her about The Journey (Resan) by Fredrik Axelson - the scenario that won the Audience Award this year.<br/><br/>But don't let her run any games before she has published Tales From the Fisherman's Wife - the Danish people demands it! We had a fabulous session Saturday night. When my "demon" began the first encounter rhyming I had to step up to the challenge - and we played the entire Fisherman story arc in rhymes - in English.<br/><br/>It was such a pleasure to host Julia, Chris, Evan, Cat and Mat. We had 16 international visitors this year (including 2 Danes in exile) - and we expect even more next year when Knudepunkt will take place in Denmark the week after Fastaval - which means two straight weeks of pure gaming madness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D" title="[Deleted User]"><img alt="[Deleted User]" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D">[Deleted User]</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265816/#Comment_265816" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T15:04:07+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  3:04PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had the pleasure of playing The Journey and ran 4 other games (two were cancelled).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was... Beautiful. I've played roleplaying games and this.... this was sublime.<br/>\nI won't regale you with the plot. This game deserves to be played. I still get flashbacks. This one game made me understand the meaning of bleed and immersion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the others, I can highly recommend Farmers Maze by Malik Hyltoft and Regitze Illum. It was a rare pleasure, a really well-written investigation scenarie where the players also play the NPC's. Also, it's the ONLY investigation scenario where I've ever not wanted to punish the killer. This very convincing world made us not even consider punishment. Instead, the killer, with family, was sent into therapy to recover from the trauma of taking a human life. <br/>\nIt was the first murder the planet had seen in 14 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHjertebrand (Heartburn) had a very interesting take on incest between a brother and sister. No force, no abuse, just love in the face of adversity. It presented some of the most intimate scenes I've ever experienced. While the author suggested we find plaers who dared kiss, i felt this was both crossing lines and not intimate enough, so I asked the players if simply putting their foreheads together instead would be ok. It was so intimate the rest of us averted our eyes because we felt like voyeurs, and not in a sexual sense by any means. There was even a scene where they held hands (different part of the scenario, the incest story was just one of three), and it was beatiful enough to literally bring tears to my eyes. As my players well know, I'm no wilting flower but a man in my 30's.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother more challenging scenario was Sense and Sensibility, playing the flighty Marianne, to a female Mr. Willoughby. It actually worked very well, and we had a great time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd say the one huge disappointment to me, was Monogami, a rerun from 98. The disappointment wasn't with the scenario, but the fact that only one player showed, and it was therefore cancelled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265907/#Comment_265907" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T04:49:16+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  4:49AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second The Journey!

Turns out there were three past Otto-winners I remembered from my teens and two young people who'd done a lot for young LARP'ers the previous year. All in all a varied table and plenty of stories and discussions on techniques. Lots of warstories as well, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrederik (who wrote the journey) was happily drunk and continued to push  pernod on me, and I was drunk enough to accept. I was even drunk enough to dance, but not too drunk to make (too much) of a fool of myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter dancing the night away with some pretty girls and drinking my fill, I took a cab and was home at about 5 in the morning, greeted by a sleepy wife who was very happy to see me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265927/#Comment_265927" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T08:31:30+00:00" title="April  7, 2010  8:31AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So great. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I second the request for games in English.

With game start at 9 am this year, I expect it was even worse. <br/><br/>The blurps for the games can be found <a href="http://www.fastaval.dk/vidensbank/doku.php?id=fv2010:list_of_scenarios" rel="nofollow">here</a> (in a rough translation based on Google Translate).<br/><br/>The games that ran in English include Behind your back, Epiphany, Farmer's Maze, Burning Hearts, Empire 40k, Passion Fruit, Previous Occupants, Sense and Sensibility, The Journey, and What to do About Tam Lin. As well as Tales from the Fisherman's Wife as an extraordinary event and the rerun game Building (H\xf8jhus: Dybt at falde) about a group of people meeting at the top of a tall building, all with the intention of jumping out to kill themselves. For some games, only characters were translated. The games in full translation are Farmer's Maze, Passion Fruit, Previous Occupants, Sense and Sensibility, The Journey, and What to do About Tam Lin. As well as some of the short form scenarios in the anthologies Empire 40k and Behind your back.<br/><br/>I haven't found links to downloads yet - but I will post them when I find them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D" title="[Deleted User]"><img alt="[Deleted User]" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D">[Deleted User]</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265939/#Comment_265939" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-07T10:12:28+00:00" title="April  7, 2010 10:12AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Way back when, I submitted a game in English for Fastaval(it was bad, trust me).

I'll try to do a small recap without spoiling anything that isn't covered in the first two scenes (there are 26).<br/>\nThe game has four characters: The Man, The Mother, The Daughter and The Stranger. Five if you count the GM's commentary which is almost a character on its own.<br/>\nThe game is post-apocalyptic. The themes are hunger, cold and desperation.<br/>\nThe main object of the game is reaching the Turning Point, where The Stranger's trying to lead our little group. Whether it's a physical or metaphorical is up for interpretation.<br/>\nThe structure of the game is very rigid. You read one scene at the time, and the scene will state what will happen and in what order, Such as 1: Daughters Monologue 2: Stranger's monologue. If you have a monologue in the scene, you'll also have a description of what you have to monologue about.<br/>\nThere can be other constraints on a scene. There's one in particular that's etched into my brain. The daughter has her head on the mother's lap, asking about death and whether  they'll really make it to the Turning Point. All the Mother's allowed to say in the scene is "I love you". Very touching scene. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen we were playing, everyone whispered, except for the Stranger. It wasn't in the script, the mood of the game just made it come naturally. Even between scenes nobody spoke and everyone walked very, very softly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game affected me deeply. I can still almost feel the taste of boiled, human flesh in my mouth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johs" title="johs"><img alt="johs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johs">johs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266061/#Comment_266061" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T02:11:44+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  2:11AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played five games/scenarios. <br/><br/>I game mastered my own \u201cThe Slave trader form Ascalon\u201d (Slavehandleren fra Ascalon) \u2013 a sword and sorcery redbox hack hack. I was too nervous to play it really well. But the other game masters games worked really really well and the written scenario won the prize for best editing. Lovely. <br/><br/>I also game mastered \u201cThe Ascalon Dynasty\u201d and \u201cCat\u201d. The Ascalon Dynasty is a sim-empire game in a sword and sorcery setting. Using some D&amp;D 4ed. and Mouse Guard mechanics. Cat is a freeform feel good story abort relationships and cancer.<br/><br/>Lucky I played the fantastic game \u201cVasen\u201d. It won the prize for best story and the prize for best scenario (the biggest one).  Vasen is a freeform game abort incest \u2013 but you don\u2019t talk or play that part. You just play a broken family and the little brothers daydreams. In many ways it\u2019s a hard game to play \u2013 but the Mikkel B\xe6kgaard (the author) wrote so it works without clich\xe9 or vulgar social realism. It\u2019s a really good scenario.  <br/><br/>I also played the scenario \u201cFucking Mental!\u201d. A very very good freeform game. Kitchen sink realism and hyper violent. Oh\u2026 did I sad that it was about English hooligans?<br/><br/>I think The Ascalon Dynasty will translated as well as I\u2019m working on a translation of The Slave trader. <br/>I wish that Vasen would be translated - because it is so elegant a scenario about something that so easily becomes corny and vulgar. And Vasen is not! As well as it\u2019s beautiful insight into the Danish games and the Danish. <br/>And the last sentence gos for Fucking Mental! as well. <br/><br/>Otherwise, there was beer, celebration and joy at Fastaval.<br/>I enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>Until the translations are ready the scenarios can be found in Danish here: <br/><a href="http://alexandria.dk/data?con=280" rel="nofollow">Here, that is.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kristoffer%20Apollo" title="Kristoffer Apollo"><img alt="Kristoffer Apollo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kristoffer%20Apollo">Kristoffer Apollo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266087/#Comment_266087" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T08:02:51+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  8:02AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2010 8:09AM by Kristoffer Apollo.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had great fun gamemastering three scenarios at Fastaval, and it's my impression that most of the 31 scenarios/games presented were of high quality indeed. Most had very positive buzz in the vibrant Fastaval caf\xe9.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, I had "Dungeon" (by Lars Andresen), a nostalgic freeform scenario set in 1986, where six D&amp;D-playing teenagers drop into a real dungeon and face goblins, evil wizards and the like. Very nice scenario with some interesting mechanics centered on character development during the game (as their established social hierarchy dissolve in the face of danger). And loads of loving dungeon in-jokes, of course. I played D&amp;D in 1986 myself, so this was a special treat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen "Salvation" (by Simon Steen Hansen), a dark western scenario with mystic undertones, where five truly evil bank robbers enter a ghost town with five hostages in tow. Kind of an old school Fastaval scenario, as it's a pretty loose freeform setup where the players pit these psycho robbers against each other as tension rises, and gunfights await. Driven by five very well-constructed characters that deservedly took home the award for Best Roles. The scenario was very popular with the players, although I think my group went worst of all, as my players wanted a bit more than just fighting amongst themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally "Fucking Mental!", which I co-wrote with Kristoffer Rudkj\xe6r. As Johs stated above, it's a freeform scenario about English football hooligans, where you play five Chelsea hooligans in the days up to an important game, ending with their brutal fight against the opposing hooligan firm. We wanted to hit a kitchen-sink realism style flavoured with the frustration and aggression of these angry young Londoners, but told through their own eyes. And I think we succeeded pretty well, primarily using extras roleplaying (letting some players play NPCs such as wifes, girlfriends, the boss at work) and semi-live enactment of the scenes towards that end. It was special pleasure when we had some 30 roleplayers bellow football fan chants during the warm-up to one session. If someone nudges us, we might just translate this scenario as well. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, otherwise there was beer, celebration, joy and lots of great people at Fastaval. It was a moment to remember when Johs flew onto the stage to accept his award.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kristoffer%20Apollo" title="Kristoffer Apollo"><img alt="Kristoffer Apollo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kristoffer%20Apollo">Kristoffer Apollo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266089/#Comment_266089" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-08T08:04:41+00:00" title="April  8, 2010  8:04AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I should second the praising of "The Journey" as well!

I spent most of my Fastaval being either hungovered, drunk, or tending bar in the caf\xe9. But I have uploaded my contribution to the 40k Imperium anthology to my blog. It is a short story game about the past and death of four terminators. It has, however, not been through the final proof reading, so I do apologize for any spelling errors.

The characters are all elves, and gadgets are spells.<br/>\nThe scenario has great flow, a few twists and turns and is really well-written. So well-written, in fact, that I would have been able to run it after just skimming through it. That, of course, made me nervous, so I read it thoroughly, convinced I'd missed something. I mean, it couldn't be THAT comprehensive. Didn't help. In the end I figured that I really must've missed something and figured I'd have to wing a few things.<br/>\nI was wrong. It really was that easy to run. And we had a great game.
