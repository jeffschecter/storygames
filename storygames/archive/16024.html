It's an old RPG from SPI - published in 1980, I think.<br/><br/>It's a weird one. Preferably, you need nine players and a GM ("director"). Players are major characters from the series - J.R., Jock, Miss Ellie etc. Each scenario sees them competing over different institutions, characters and other resources.<br/><br/>Every scene starts with the director giving a little info, and putting some new cards on the table. Then, negotiations begin. The players go off (usually in pairs) to discuss who will support who, what cards to trade, perhaps give away a little power (represented by tokens) to get what they want. <br/><br/>When negotiations are done, it's time for conflict resolution! Everyone starts trying to control things - maybe they want the Texas Rangers card lying on the table, maybe they want to get Ewing Oil from J. R., or maybe they want to find out what that face-down card is that Pamela is trying to hide. In this phase, the major characters usually try to gain control of minor characters and other cards - or get info. This is called an Affect, and you use different stats based on whether you want to Seduce, Coerce or Persuade. You can also use minor characters under your control to do stuff.<br/><br/>In play, it was fun to begin with, but got a little tiresome; it needs some work from the director to make it really exciting, and the conflict resolution phase isn't described in detail. We didn't know if everyone should state intentions and then roll at the same time, for instance, or whether everyone got to do all their actions before the next player. So it got a little boring sometimes when players had to wait for six other players to do their thing before they could get their single die roll... which, of course, sometimes failed and had no interesting results.<br/><br/>Negotiation phases could be a drag for some; if you had a lot to discuss, you'd be talking until the director dragged you back to the table, but if not, you'd just hang around and do nothing.<br/><br/>All in all, it was sort of like Diplomacy meets Illuminati (the old version). <br/><br/>I think it's a very promising design; it's got an interesting and fun premise, and with some modern solutions to the conflict resolution, it could really shine. In retrospect, I'd like to try it again - with tweaks.<br/><br/>The winner - the only person who got all their victory conditions - was Wilhelm, playing Pamela. It was his first visit to HolmCon. He sat very quietly for the last conflict round, passing each turn. I thought he was just bored with the game, but then when all dice had been rolled and the smoke cleared, he announced that he'd got all the cards he needed! Clever bastard, he'd even half-hidden them under his character sheet so as not to get too much attention.<br/><br/>There's a very real chance that he's reigning world champion of the Dallas RPG - since I don't know of anyone who's played it for the last twenty years.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365182/#Comment_365182" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T02:48:20+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  2:48AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were to make a "german" version of the game (as in "german boardgames" - simplified, shorter, more abstract), I'd do this:<br/><br/>- Make it about fewer characters<br/>- Give everyone one hidden action per conflict phase<br/>- Have slightly more specific scene instructions <br/>- Maybe attempt to make it director-less<br/><br/>The game in itself requires no roleplaying if you don't want to.

It would certainly benefit from some tightening of method, but I'm not sure the idea of turing it into a game for fewer players is a good one. I believe it would be better still, with more players, if the method could be worked to help them resolve the conflicts in a hastier manner. Perhaps this could be achieved by making it GM-free, having a method that all players can control, so the conflicts could be handled simultaneously. <br/><br/>Anyway: had a nice time playing it, with a couple of very nice scenes of role-playing that made it well worth the while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365191/#Comment_365191" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T03:58:13+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  3:58AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, more players is probably more fun.

I love the mix of light characterization and goal-driven trading in an asynchronous but closed environment.<br/><br/>If you tweak it, I would look for a way to take out the random element of the stat rolls and turn them into a resource management element instead.<br/><br/>It sounds like a game where people would start resources that they didn't need, and try to trade them for the resources they do need. You could make the resource elements (cards or whatever) somewhat plentiful so that trades could happen at varying exchange rates, so one of the goals is to get a good deal when trading - rather than a sparse economy where trading one Oil Company card for one Police Influence card would be the norm. For example, you could put out several Oil Company Shares cards, and anyone who can gather 5 of the 9 cards has a majority share and control of the oil company - stuff like that would be fun. At least for me.<br/><br/>Glad you guys had fun playing the game. Sounds like the kind of situation-driven game (as opposed to characterization-driven) that my wife prefers to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
