A lot of folks have had experiences with 4E that they want to share. There were a wide variety of experiences that emerged from playing 4E (from loving it so much as to play it weekly, to dismissing it with hatred). A lot of threads where people post their thoughts on D&amp;D 4E tend to go loopy pretty quickly, usually due to people with conflicting experiences telling each other what they should feel about the Game They Like/Hate. So I wanted to have a Share Your Thoughts thread, one that is heavily moderated and ruled.<br/><br/><b>So here's the rules. If you don't read them, your post will be deleted</b>.<br/><br/><b>RULE ZERO:</b> You MUST have played D&amp;D 4E, preferably more than once. If you are posting here because you read it thoroughly but have not played it--you're /wrong/, and GTFO.<br/><br/><b>RULE ONE:</b> You only get one post. Just one. Your thoughts. You can go back and revise it, adding more or citing others, but no more than one single post. If you have a "Oh, that post there reminds me..." thought, revise your original post or create a new one.<br/>Whispers don't count, you can whisper others as much as you want.<br/><br/><b>RULE TWO:</b> Addendum to Rule One, indicating the point of this thread: You're sharing your experiences, experiences which for the purpose of this thread are inviolate: No one can judge you on them in this thread, <b>even if you're wrong </b>(here I'm thinking of folks saying "I don't like 4e because there's no wandering monsters", then JD or someone pointing them to the page which explains wandering monsters). If you want to correct people, to tell them that they weren't doing it right or that Rule X Clearly Exists or whatever, please create another thread and do so, not here.<br/><br/>Ready?

The group I played with keyed into it perfectly, we all engaged with every aspect of the rules and didn't take it too seriously.  It's like a big, expansive board game where you get to role-play your character if you want to (and you're not forced, by the game, to do so if you don't).  I had D&amp;D fans, MMO players and board gamers all enjoying the same game, together.  We stopped playing it because I got burned out on spending so much time creating balanced encounters but when we did play it, it was fantastic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369381/#Comment_369381" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T08:52:08+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  8:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 8:53AM by Andy.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's my experience.<br/><br/>In the leadup to 4e, I had a semi-regular weekend group that met up for D&amp;D 3.5e on Sundays. When 4E came out, we flipped (both Out in enthusiasm, and Over to that ruleset).<br/><br/>When I saw the grognardia (and by those I mean the ones who would never even try the game before playing it) denounce the game, I pretty much ignored them. The same shit went down around 3e, when people were equating the malleability of character types to WOTG's Magic the Gathering and the like. <br/>So for folks who decried it a board game, or a tactical wargame with no role-playing, I listened to those comments but then dismissed them. In most cases it appeared to be clearly towers of logic built upon gut prejudices.<br/>4e is *clearly* a role-playing game. You play roles, how much more fundamental does it possibly fucking get? <br/><br/>So I played 4e a lot since it came out. One mini-campaign, two other low-level campaigns. I pretty much stuck to the core books, and never got into the piles and piles and piles of expanded material (PHB 2, 3, all the supplemental stuff).<br/><br/>To make a long story short, after about two years of play I had these realizations:<br/>1) D&amp;D 4e combat made me look at RPG combat completely differently, forever. It was exciting, dramatic, very tactical without being too "Avalon Hill Bookcase Game-y" (the map tactics, the bloodied conditions and other game conditions). It made combat in other games as bland and tasteless as ash. We played L5R and 1-2 other games right after a 4e campaign, and in each case it felt so contrived and boring, "Roll some dice, look for high numbers, stand toe to toe with an enemy until one falls over after a few minutes". As creative as gaming got in the mid-90s onward, this above statement pretty much summarizes the combat mechanics of most RPGs out there, from Deadlands to Fading Suns to Earthdawn to L5R to Tribe 8 to World of Darkness to Whatever. Forever more, if a game emphasized combat scenes, it either had to be at least remotely as interesting as D&amp;D4e, or had to be tactically interesting/intriguing in other ways, especially in more ways than "Hit rolls"("Defense Rolls") "Damage Rolls" ("Soak/Armor Rolls").<br/><br/>2) As a GM, I found it much harder to plan encounters than 3e. The balance required meant that it was much harder to Sandbox a 4e game compared to what i was used to with the limited (and less tactically interesting) stats of 3e: Not only was there the monster, there was the terrain to think about as well. All the other RPG aspects were easy enough, it was just really hard for me to quickly put together a freeform encounter, certainly more time than it took with the comparable 3e.<br/><br/>3) I thought the expanded books were shit: <br/>* Using the themes in the PHB of Striker, Controller, Defender, they combined them with the "power sources" into (IMO) ridiculous spinoffs. A million bizarre little Prestiege Classes were replaced by a million bizarre full character classes. And because of the mandate of perfect balance, all of them started to feel similar to the core classes, and certainly similar to other combat roles (in terms of effects, dice used, etc). I was going through one of the expanded books the other day at the game store looking at some character classes, being able to read pretty much every ability and trace it back pretty much as a basic reskin of something that appeared in the core book.<br/>* They had no heart. The D&amp;D 2e days certainly suffered from having too much fluff and not enough crunch, perhaps. In any case, it's the generation of books I grew up on: Even the Complete Gladiator's Book was a book filled with seting info, cultural (to dark sun) info, weapons, kits (character class variants) that were more description than rulesy-rules, etc. Comparing them to 4e was like night and day: No fluff, everything seems to come down to description text for the core elements of the books: New Races, New Classes, New Weapons/Items, DONE: NEXT. 2e suffered (perhaps) from too many supplements that were wordy, that had too much background fluff, but 4e certainly suffers the opposite.<br/>-- For example Dark Sun, my favorite campaign world. I was so ready to buy that Day One at GenCon a few years back. Then I flipped through the copy (and this was still when I was even BIG into 4e at the time); saw basically the laundry list of "not a lot of setting, just Races, Classes, Weapons, Items/Magic Items, Monsters, and fluff was only inserted into the abilities and descriptors of those elements"... I put it down and walked away. That was actually probably the dam bursting for me, getting me to rethink 4e.<br/><br/>4) As a player, ultimately, I lost interest because we weren't role-playing, and that's My Thing.<br/>- D&amp;D 4e is a Role-Playing Game! I still believe that, and argue with people who say that it is not!<br/>- And yet, in game after game, that very interesting, tactical combat system just took up too much of the mindspace of the rules and the players. It got to the point where like three gaming sessions in a row would end with "Shit, it's time to end the session, and we /forgot to role-play again/!"<br/>The combats were exciting and fun as shit! But ultimately we were ALL there to Play Roles, and it wasn't happening because of this giant other awesome thing that was clamoring for our attention.<br/><br/>It's weird, it really helped me get a lock on what I really like and don't like about the hobby, and more able to carefully choose games that I will like and avoid ones that I would not. It got me really interested in combat in RPGs and carefully evaluating combat systems. It also pushed me more towards games that were at their core more "social" (playing Social characters). It also kept me interested in old school style fantasy gaming while looking for new systems to do it with (Red Box Hack, the 13th Age playtest, etc).<br/><br/>So that's my story.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369383/#Comment_369383" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T08:54:53+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  8:54AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a pretty good time, but the payoff wasn't quite worth the GM prep. Fights usually had some really cool moments surrounded by some slogging. I definitely felt the GM burnout from working too hard on making cool encounters time after time. Eventually I felt like Ravenloft (and the other adventure games) hit the same spot without the heavy prep work, so my 4E books have eventually drifted to being references. But that's only after many sessions, including playing through two of the published modules in their entirety.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369385/#Comment_369385" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T09:07:44+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  9:07AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 4:14PM by johnzo.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have fun with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369386/#Comment_369386" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T09:09:34+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  9:09AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2012 1:25PM by Krippler.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I jumped in to a campaign at 8th level as a fighter. My powers felt fun and it was easy to pick and chose to make your fighting style match your character. The fights themselves were slow and  boring and even if some were tough with near wipes the tension just wasn't there. The optimal tactics felt obvious and the only real hindrance was that other players didn't grasp them and that having to bark orders and explain good play would have taken even longer time and also made me look like an asshole. Skill challenges combines the worst aspects of task resolution with abstract conflict resolution. I think the game would be salvagable as a 2-player versus game where your guys kill each other in an arena.<br/><br/>Maybe you could make a game I'd have fun with if you really put thought in to encounter design, consequences for skill challenges and a greater focus on strategic play.<br/><br/>PS. my fighter could totally use rituals, it felt right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369387/#Comment_369387" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T09:24:56+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  9:24AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 9:26AM by thadrine.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sat down to play a more "Strategic" version of DnD, and it delivered. I realized that what I was playing was probably the best miniatures combat game I had ever even seen. <br/><br/>After a few sessions I realized I did not want to play it anymore, as miniatures combat, while technically not the only thing, was the main thing it was about. I also felt as though I had to pull pieces from multiple books and tinker with my character out of game constantly just to make sure I actually got all of "My enjoyment" from the game. There were "Bad" ways to build a character that were just less fun. Great combat encounters were a blast to play through, as long as you did not want to do something outside of the rules (which always felt restrictive). <br/><br/>By the end of it all I had learned a lot about gaming and mechanics, way more than I ever thought I would. The game was fun for a while, and did what it was intended to do very well. It just burnt me out rather quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369388/#Comment_369388" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T09:29:00+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  9:29AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 12:37PM by Judd.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just wrote out a long response that got eaten.  Here's the abridged version.<br/><br/>Played a fun <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/story-hour/231365-daggers-deviltry.html" rel="nofollow">Tiefling Rogue</a> and a cool <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/general-rpg-discussion/229295-d-d-4th-edition-setting-no-age-heroes.html" rel="nofollow">human Paladin</a>.  The rogue's game fell through because of scheduling and the paladin's game fell through because the DM nailed a TPK and got gun-shy about running the game.<br/><br/><b>The Good</b><br/>I like the Raven Queen; she is a cool addition to the D&amp;D mythos.  I liked the way the different powers and stuff allowed me to make my friends' characters even more awesome; teamwork was cool in 4e.  I like the way the Points of Light idea was explained.  <br/><br/>In my D&amp;D 4e best moment, my tiefling rogue blinded a green dragon and effed up its wings to the other characters could swarm the bastard and kill it.  It was sweet.<br/><br/><b>The Bad</b><br/>Skill Challenges seemed a bit flat.  Experience points never felt like a reward mechanism, more of a timing mechanism, which is fine if that is the way they are presented.  There was still shitty DM advice about fudging rolls.<br/><br/>It felt like the dice could run cold for folks and they could spend an entire session not doing cool shit.<br/><br/><b>The Judd</b><br/>I think I have been looking for a robust, character driven RPG since I figured out what these games could do and for me, that game is Burning Wheel.  I enjoyed this iteration of D&amp;D in a new way because it was the first edition of the game that I didn't want to be something it wasn't.  I have BW and don't need other games to be it anymore.  I could just enjoy this game for what it was.<br/><br/>Right before D&amp;Dnext was announced, I was cleaning out books for my future move to NYC and realized that I would probably never play D&amp;D4e ever again.  I gave them to a friend who was getting ready to play in a campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369391/#Comment_369391" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T09:35:04+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  9:35AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gave D&amp;D 3rd Edition a couple tries when it first game out, but 4E is the only version of D&amp;D that actually worked for me. Some of that was simply the timing, but as someone who likes RPGs but not board games, it was my first exposure to that kind of super-tight game design that you don't usually see in RPGs. It wasn't <i>perfect</i>, especially out of the gate, but it was a lot closer to being properly balanced than most any other RPG ever. Pretty much the only thing keeping it from being perfect for my gaming group is that the DM's time commitment is still pretty high, even if by all accounts it's a major improvement over 3.5. We had a ton of fun and got in a good amount of role-playing, but there was a definite sense that it took a lot of effort to get that RP to continue into a combat, without much reward. Although I'm glad the game doesn't let the magic using character poof problems away (something that for me made several other games less fun in the past), I did and still do feel that skill challenges and rituals are good ideas that never got properly realized.<br/><br/>Our 4E games have kind of petered out after ~3 years of regular-ish play, and I'm glad that I have a second gaming group that goes in for a greater variety of games. I really enjoyed playing 4E and would happily play again, but I've never been the type to be happy playing just one RPG for a really long time. We've also played 3-4 one-shots of the 4E Gamma World, which is an absolute blast and shows that the basic chassis of 4E is much simpler and more versatile than people realize. When I started playing 4E I looked at my friend's shelf of 3.5 books and knew that they would eventually produce more supplements that I could bring myself to care about, and indeed that happened around when Essentials came out. The only thing that makes me a little sad 4E is going away is that between other offshoots in the manner of GW and refinements to the rough spots in the game, it still has a lot of untapped potential.<br/><br/>I don't really have time to work on it right now, but I want to put what I learned from 4E, good and bad, into a new game called <a href="http://yarukizero.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/slime-quest-thoughts/" rel="nofollow">Slime Quest</a>, which as I'm envisioning it right now will be like a simplified anime-inspired 4E with bits of Meikyuu Kingdom, Arianrhod, Mouse Guard, and FATE bolted on. I want subject mater inspired by anime and Japanese video games instead of D&amp;D that drew from Tolkien and Conan and such and is now eating its own tail.

I enjoyed it, but I felt the combats were too long (especially once we got into paragon tier) and thought that it lost some of that 'spark' of creativity that I really liked about earlier editions (the rules, especially spells and magic items seemed geared to discourage creative solutions to out of battle problems). <br/><br/>Later, and actually currently, I'm in a game as a player. It's ok. Sometimes its a lot of fun when we fight a cool monster on an interesting battlefield, but when its just normal monsters in a room or something to that effect, it really, really drags. We know the players are going to win, just get on with it already. Also, I find that while the powers are cool for a while, after the 150th combat round of a character designed to do the same optimal tactics, fights can get tedious from the player side, especially with the high miss rate in battle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369401/#Comment_369401" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T10:50:23+00:00" title="March 27, 2012 10:50AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 2:18PM by Adam_Dray.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd followed EN World's previews before the game came out. I had the bootleg PHB and DMG docs pretty early on. I got the H-1 preview module as soon as it came out, and that was just in time for me to run it at a small minicon that I organize every year. I had six players of different experience levels, from rookie to grognard, and they all had a blast killing kobolds. However, that module was organized terribly. There wasn't a lot in there to support anything but combat, too. I winged a bunch of stuff, and the kobold prisoner/sidekick they picked up was the players' favorite part of the game -- which is telling now.<br/><br/>I pretty much adored this game upon reading it and playing it early on. However, I hated that Wizards upped the gonzo factor so much. More weird races, more weird classes. All the art seemed to be full of spikes and horns. It bugged me.<br/><br/>Fred pulled me into One Bad Egg, a PDF-only 3rd-party publisher of 4E supplements. I edited a handful of these and contributed creative material to the Gods product (Torchbearer has been in my campaigns for ten years or more). Editing 4E stuff is hard, because there's a lot of technical crunch that needs to be pored over. This gig also raised another issue for me: if you create a custom race or class, your players aren't going to use it because Wizards' online character generator doesn't support it.<br/><br/>I ran two campaigns of my own. Both were designed to accommodate the incredible gonzo-ness of the races and classes.<br/><br/>The first campaign was Metrocalypse. Basically Oxford, England, gets sucked into the D&amp;D world in 1605. PCs are normal English folk, who get mutated by the new world's magic, becoming elves and wardens and half-orcs and stuff. We played 6-8 sessions of that before it fell apart. I'm not sure why it died. It was a weeknight game and half my players were driving 60-90 minutes to the game, and it probably just wasn't entertaining enough to be worth the drive. That campaign had a good mix of role-playing and combats and by-the-book (broken, but fun) skill challenges. Somewhere on the forum is my write-up of the Christian conversion of a tribe of polytheistic bullywugs.<br/><br/>The second campaign was Saberpunk. This was a city of millions of people artificially crammed into a city of stacked layers. Cramming people together created magical energy, which the city tapped and used for all kinds of stuff, akin to magitech-power. The setting was high fantasy with dark cyberpunk elements. We played 15-20 sessions before moving on. I was using Stalker0's modified skill challenges, which were awesome. I leveled players pretty quickly (every two or three 4-hour sessions) and it felt like players were mainly interested in what new combat gadgets they could use (i.e., the game's reward system worked well, but it encouraged people to fight more). As the levels increased to around 5 (I think), it was starting to feel like the game was about combat. There was lots of role-playing but it was starting wane. I'm not entirely sure why we stopped playing, and I have an itch to revisit the themes and setting, but not with 4E. Maybe with 13th Age. =D<br/><br/>For Saberpunk, I created a new race. You could play a Gargoyle, which was one of the city's statues that had come to life. There was a smaller version with some limited flying powers and a large, stompy version. I had excluded warforged from the campaign for thematic reasons but really, the larger gargoyles were very similar. Players seemed interested in the idea, but didn't make any gargoyle characters because the DDI character generator tool didn't support them.<br/><br/>I also played in a few games here and there. Our local Maryland Heroes' Guild ran a West Marches-style sandbox for a while and I played in 2-3 of these games. Daniel Levine organized a similar sandbox when Dark Sun came out and I played in 2-3 of those. I had a great time in the Dark Sun games; less fun in the prior generic sandbox.<br/><br/>I also attended D&amp;D Encounters at local game stores five times. Two were purely one-shots in my mind. The last three were at a different store with a different pair of DMs, and they ran a less by-the-books 4E campaign using the Encounters materials. There was plenty of role-playing, silly voices, and some character development (all to my surprise). The play was fun but lackluster. The other players did not "step on up" to the combat challenges, and I seemed to be the only player who cared about tactics. The DM fudged (I knew he fudged, but I doubt other players did) to save our lives many times. I stopped going when I decided to run Apocalypse World and Labyrinth Lord campaigns every week.<br/><br/>In short, 4E produced some really fun times but also a lot of frustration. I didn't have the encounter-creation problems that other posters have talked about. I found it a breeze to use the rules to snap together a handful of monsters at appropriate challenge levels, even reskinning them as was useful. I often did this during play in 30 seconds or so. Stalker0's skill challenge rules made that part of the game fun for everyone again. We just found ourselves focusing on all the combat stuff.<br/><br/>The books themselves were a constant disappointment. They were walls of powers with no soul. I'd flip through a 150-200-page splatbook in fifteen minutes and feel like I'd wasted 30 bucks. The Dragon and Dungeon content on DDI was often similar in nature for me, though I enjoyed the design articles and editorials. I never played any of the published modules (other than H-1).<br/><br/>I'm curious about D&amp;D Next. I'm totally psyched about 13th Age, which is totally a love letter to D&amp;D (OSR and 4E alike).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369402/#Comment_369402" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T10:52:38+00:00" title="March 27, 2012 10:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was just dull, like a board game that wasn't fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369405/#Comment_369405" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T11:35:39+00:00" title="March 27, 2012 11:35AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D4 was Wizards of the Coast's attempt to introduce (1) board game elements &amp; (2) new monetization models into the D&amp;D franchise.<br/>They achieved a partial success with both goals, but at the expense of a great deal of customer backlash.<br/>In the end, the board game elements turned out to be better suited to a line of D&amp;D board games, which are awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369408/#Comment_369408" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T11:49:24+00:00" title="March 27, 2012 11:49AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I loved creating characters for it, using the books for ideas on cool color and then using the software for ease of use.

They served champagne in plastic cups, row after row of them slowly warming up and losing their fizz as the gamers ignored them. We had a fun time and we did play it again but much like the champagne, 4e fell flat for me. There were just too many rules, tactical options limited in such a way as to make them too numerous to learn without the tedium and too few to be really interesting.

There was some tactics to it, but we also had social issues with how he dealt with player actions in it.  <br/><br/>I also played a short tournament game at KublaCon featuring a huge Dwarven Forge terrain setup.  This was very well prepared - with printed D&amp;DI sheets for all the characters.  It was also basically a long fight that worked reasonably but did not impress me much.  For tactical combat, I preferred other games such as Hero System or Macho Women With Guns.  <br/><br/>As a side note, I have also played the D&amp;D4 related boardgames several dozen times - Castle Ravenloft, Wrath of Ashardalon, and Legend of Drizzt.

I have several veteran roleplayers and several who are brand new to roleplaying. Everyone loves the game and here are a few reasons why:<br/><br/>1. Very tactical and tactile play. I use 3d terrain whenever I can, everyone likes having minis to represent their characters and where they stand, they like the maps, they like treating combat partly as a skirmish and partly as problem solving, and it gives everyone the same reference points during play.<br/><br/>2. Those video game elements everyone bitched about, such as triggering quests and buffing characters, are things we actually enjoy. Everyone gets a kick out of those kinds of elements. Which leads me to my next point ...<br/><br/>3. Simple stories. There is a lot of roleplaying at my table, but none of us have a lot of time to invest, so the consensus is to keep things moving forward and relatively simple. 4E both allows and encourages that in the way adventures are designed and how quest hooks work. We are telling stories and having fun but we are not trying to write The Lord of the Rings or A Game of Thrones. We're fine with that.<br/><br/>4. Powers. As many comparisons as this drew to online games or Magic the Gathering, it works for me and my players. We like triggering powers, we like showing off with the big Daily power, we like the little bits of story color to go with our attacks and we like feeling like magical super heroes.<br/><br/>5. I love the Points of Light/Nentir Vale setting. It is just enough info that I want more, but nothing I have to memorize or treat like canon. It is an ideal setting for me and I believe there is a ton of support for it between published materials and DDi.<br/><br/>My group is level 6 right now and one of the players has started a second 4E game (with me as a player) in Neverwinter. This weekend I will be running a one-shot game in the Nentir Vale using Kobold Manor out of the DMG for my 10 yo son, a friend's 11 yo daughter and a couple of my players. It's not an incredible adventure or a masterful game, but I promise it will be fun and the kids will talk about it for weeks to come.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369415/#Comment_369415" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T12:13:42+00:00" title="March 27, 2012 12:13PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 12:27PM by Wordman.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played half a dozen sessions with a group I'd never met before. Observations in no particular order:<br/><br/>1) I used the D&amp;D insider character builder thing (I played a Goliath Warden). I did the whole "print out power cards and cut them to size and use just those at the table" instead of using a character sheet. This worked better than I thought it would, even though the software was a little weak. A side effect of this is that I pretty much never had to engage with the math of the game, as the software applied all the right numbers at the right time.<br/><br/>2) Compared to other versions of D&amp;D, it felt like 4e hit a sweet spot in terms of "shit your guy can do". Enough to always have some options, but not so much that you couldn't keep track of it all. I suppose the power cards helped in this regard. At the time, I remember admiring the design choice made at higher levels where, instead of learning additional powers, you swapped out weaker ones with more formidable choices (that is, you scale a power curve, but the amount of crap you have to remember stays about the same).<br/><br/>3) A lot of the mechanical bits (push/pull effects, marks of various kinds) did seem to foster an emergent behavior to some of the combats, particularly once the players figured out how they worked. That is, once player A did X and player B did Y, the mix of the two sort of changed the nature of the game in our heads.<br/><br/>4) Combat seemed slightly faster than other versions of D&amp;D, though that is not saying much. It also might not actually be true, but merely a perceptual thing biased by being more engaged off-turn (see previous point).<br/><br/>5) The way saving throws worked caused confusion for people who played earlier versions (in 4E, you get a save each round until you succeed, basically). Once you get it, though, the 4E version beats "save or die" stuff every time.<br/><br/>6) This particular campaign was a conversion to 4e of an earlier 3.5 campaign (in which I did not play; not much of a problem, as my character was the "foreigner arriving from a far away land", so my cluelessness at what the rest took for granted turned out to be an asset). I got the impression that most of the players thought that they could more accurately model the character in their head using 4e, except for one grognard who lamentent the loss of utility-like spells that could be applied in creative ways.<br/><br/>7) The campaign wound up being very political (that is, the PCs engaged in much political maneuvering). What this meant is that vast portions of each session mostly totally ignored the 4e mechanics. They weren't particularly a hindrance to the scheming, but they didn't help in any way either. Ultimately, this contributed significantly to the campaign's disintegration, where the GM and most players went searching for a system that better matched their style. (Scheduling prevented anything from coming of this search, as far as I can tell.)<br/><br/>In all, it was a bit like we were playing two different games: a crunchy tactical combat game and a freeform political intrique game. The two were not a great mix, even though I remember the sessions as fun (good players riffing off each other helped). My big takeaway from it was that I <i>really</i> wanted to play the 4e-like <i>Gamma World</i>, which seems like it would be a total blast as a tactical game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369424/#Comment_369424" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T12:52:13+00:00" title="March 27, 2012 12:52PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 1:01PM by David Artman.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My only time playing was with this guy:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>I sucked at running the game.</blockquote>...and he's wrong!<br/><br/>It was a great little intro session with two smallish combats.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, I found the boardgamey bits ("roll-playing") to be solid and engaging. I don't need a reason to act, so "role-playing" just sort of emerged. I can't say that the mechanics did anything to promote acting in character.<br/><br/>Mark did a good job with providing ability cards and sheets, so it was manageable even though they were mid-level characters. Of course, I make Hero System characters for fun, so I doubt it would have been hard for me to pick-up character gen and the math bits, even though I didn't have to for this demo session.<br/><br/>One encounter was really sweet: our party raiding an airship (like, a ship carried by balloons... or was it magic? It's been a while...) and so, every turn start, Mark rolled two dice: one to determine which way the ship pitched, and the other to determine how far one would slide if one failed (IIRC) some kind of Dex check. Thus, pushing and pulling enemies to the edge of the ship made a sort of "second-order" tactics, above and beyond basic positioning, blooding, etc. I'm sure at least a couple of bad guys took the long drop.<br/><br/>I also have a VAGUE recollection that my guy was hard to get into the middle of combat, compared to the other classes (and more-experienced players). Low movement rate, maybe? No class abilities to charge or what-not? Dunno. But I don't recall any one moment when I was like, "yeah, that's MY GUY did that!" so....<br/><br/>The proof is in the pudding, and in spite of the cool maps, figures, encounters, and play aides... I didn't rush out to buy 4E. I haven't rushed out to buy any D&amp;D since AD&amp;D(1: Deities &amp; Demigods-era). GURPS and then Hero owned my fantasy (and most other genre's) space for almost all of the early 90s, then LARPing WoD in the late 90s and boffer into the 21st century. Then... I thought "I'm gonna make Hero for LARPs" and did some googling and found... The Forge.<br/><br/>It's been "this new thing of ours" ever since, for me (though I *still* want to get GLASS out the door! maybe a Kickstarter....). If I felt the urge to play 4E, I'd get my buddy who owns all the Descent: Journeys in the Dark expansions to host a game, using a user-created scenario.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369427/#Comment_369427" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T12:56:56+00:00" title="March 27, 2012 12:56PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in both games that Judd mentioned.<br/><br/>1)  I think that 4th ed did small party teamwork better than any game i've ever played... including several superhero games like Champions where teamwork is the norm.  I dug that quite a bit.  Like Judd, it was cool to do your neato move at just the right time that supported and helped your team mate(s).  Table talk was very high and that had a kinda fun vibe to it.  <br/><br/>2)  Combat did drag on a bit.  I don't think the numbers scaled with the levels as well as they could have.  <br/><br/>3)  I love the idea of the idea of Skill Challenges.  Unfortunately, the math didn't really hold up and we would have a couple of folks who had the appropriate skill doing all the heavy lifting.  Others just passed in order to give a +2 to heavy lifters.  What was supposed to promote roleplaying seemed to confuse a few players (not us Burning Wheel folks who have had many Duel of Wits under our belts and roleplaying during while dice are hitting the table is 2nd nature).  Roleplaying in both games was really sparse.  Judd and I tended to try and push our characters into the setting but both GMs seemed to be primarily focused on combat set pieces.  <br/><br/>4)  I didn't mind the setting being vague.  I tend to make up my own shit anyways.  <br/><br/>5)  In the end, Savage Worlds, Legends of Anglerre, Burning Wheel (for very different reasons than the first two) are better fantasy game fits for me.  Combat is faster, roleplaying is easier, skills are better realized.  I'm glad I played 4th edition, I enjoyed parts of it quite a bit.  I would be curious to see if The One Ring, which has a pretty hard coded team dynamic (oops...sorry.. Fellowship) in its mechanics would stack up.  But alas, I haven't found an opportunity to play that system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369431/#Comment_369431" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T13:10:26+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  1:10PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played 15 or so sessions of 4e, all but one as DM. Most of this play was with a regular D&amp;D group that formed when 3e was released and had been together for about 7 years. All of this play, save for one event I ran at a con, was at 1st-4th level or so. The con event I ran had 10th level PCs.<br/><br/>My group were very hard-core rules masters and combat monsters; we had crazy system mastery with 3e. But, the game had gotten pretty tedious at that point, straining under the weight of all the supplements. <br/><br/>Ergo, I was incredibly excited about 4e. I'm (still) a huge Mearls fanboy. I loved the preview books; I thought all of the changes to the cosmology and the idea about "points of light" were all brilliant. I also was very happy with the basic mechanical ideas in 4e, namely that all attacks and actions could be expressed as Ability vs. Defense; that was an ingenious tweak to d20, IMO.<br/><br/>I ran my regular group through <i>Keep on the Shadowfell</i> and 90% of <i>Thunderspire Labyrinth</i>. At first, we really enjoyed the game. DM'ing was much easier for me than 3e, combats were going faster and were more enjoyable, even for the less tactically-mided players in the group. Overall, I became a huge fan and evangelist for 4e. I bought tons of dungeon tiles and Litko condition markers. As a Forge-head, I loved 4e's focused design.<br/><br/>But then... I dunno. The fun started to wear off. The key problem for me, and my primary criticism of 4e, was spelled out in a bog post by... Josh Roby or Jonathan Walton, I can't remember which. Basically: <b>the fiction doesn't really matter in 4e</b>. Looking at the battlemat tells you everything you need to know in order to play. The power descriptions all become meaningless fluff, and you get a board game about plastic figures inflicting hit point damage and sliding each other around the board. The few skill challenges we played were utterly boring. The game simply felt roleplaying-agnostic.<br/><br/>In the end, 4e broke up our group. Enough of us were sick of the game that the others who were still enthusiastic just cut us loose. End of an era!<br/><br/>I'm normally kind of a pack rat when it comes to games; I got rid of a lot of 3e products when we moved to 4e, but still have some key items. Not so with 4e. I had accumulated a ton of 4e product, and I jettisoned it pretty mercilessly once the group disbanded. 4e is a very soulless game to me, so parting with the books (and canceling my DDI account) was pretty easy.The only books I kept were the preview booklets; the game promised in those products is freaking amazing. I think they would serve as great guideposts for D&amp;D hack experiments.<br/><br/>Last data point: I organize Chicago Gameday, and I can tell you that over the last few years, getting people to sign up for D&amp;D 4e events has been nigh impossible. We have no problem filling seats for Pathfinder, OSR, 0e and 1e events, however.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to see what happens with "D&amp;DNext" (as much as I hate that branding), but, honestly, I think it's the OSR (old school) and Paizo (new school) that are the true inheritors of D&amp;D's legacy. WotC really, really screwed the pooch with 4e. I'm doubly sad that <i>Dragon</i>, <i>Dungeon</i>, and the d20 community essentially got sacrificed in the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369435/#Comment_369435" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T13:17:36+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  1:17PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played about five sessions of 4th edition D&amp;D all told. As I tell people when it comes up, my impression has been that it's a compelling skirmish wargame, but not much of a roleplaying game. I think that the reason for my impression is that the game consists of mostly fights, and play between fights does not impact those fights - can't impact them much, really, as the fighting subgame works best when it's preplanned and balanced in isolation from whatever might be going on in the fiction. I know that others have managed to play otherwise, but the combination of the tools and examples set by the official materials has not left me with significant tools for anything but fights over fights with some essentially meaningless fluff pieces thrown in. Not significant tools in comparison with e.g. Mentzer red box, to pick an edition of D&amp;D that provides a method that's deeper and more interactive than traditional illusionism.<br/><br/>My experience of the game's setting is also pretty irk-some, frankly. I don't like the feeling of safety and status quo the game excrudes. The mechanical focus on balance makes the player characters seem mundane and boring instead of exceptional, and their inability to act with agency outside of the narrow venue of a battlefield enhances this feel - I feel like nothing has stakes in the setting, because it's all just a comforting carnival ride. In this context the fiction is only too easily read by myself as fluffy platitudes: <i>of course</i> these guys have magical flashlights, it's not like we'd want PCs to actually be threatened by the terrors of the dark. Every convenience the setting piles on to make the movement from one set-piece combat to the next feels more plastic than the last, until I simply can't take the setting seriously anymore as anything but a computer game cutscene. <i>Of course</i> the <i>Against the Giants</i> globe-trotting arc involves convenient teleporters the GMNPC uses to transfer the party from one place to another, it's not like we'd want them to have to deal with time pressure and travel logistics and random unassociated events on the way from point A to point B. <i>Of course</i> all setting problems boil down to the need to fight a half dozen fortuitously balanced bad guys on a clearly lineated battle-field. It's not serious as a setting, the events do not feel true to life.<br/><br/>My disdain for the game's literary qualities isn't helped by the frankly idiotic "fluff" that the combat-centered class and power descriptions involve. I don't know why nobody seems to ever notice this, but they're all just descriptions of killing people in different ways, so these character definitions end up lacking in any sort of social texture. Obvious enough for powers, I guess, but I think it's pretty sad if your "roleplaying notes" for a "rogue" say that the character is "an agile fighter who darts in and out of melee to execute lethal backstabbing attacks." Is that everything you have to say about rogue characters in the context of your fantasy world, really? The classes and powers almost uniformly lack a solid feel for actually meaning anything in the setting. I make mention of this because I think that this promotion of the skirmish boardgame over the fiction in importance is directly correlated with the way I respond to the game: of course it's more of a wargame than a roleplaying game, the fiction is always ignored in favour of the miniatures scenario. What would be more wargameish? If a game became a roleplaying game by just having named characters, your average boardgame would be one.<br/><br/>A serious procedural problem I've had with the game is it's integrity failure as regards PC death: the game commits the traditional game's typical sin of sort of promising the players a hard fight, but then winking to the GM, shuffling a lot of numbers and intimating that it's OK to cheat if that's the only way to make sure that the party will ultimately triumph. I've yet to play the game with a group that would have taken this participationist agenda seriously, and this "no cheating" attitude has resulted in a relatively unplayable game. The way it's gone, in both the D&amp;D and Gamma World iterations of the system, is that we play 1-2 fights, until our entire party dies against the opposition, at which point we have no satisfying way of continuing the game. We've tried repeating a failed fight in the spirit of "getting it right", but that's actually pretty dull in practice. We've also tried to play character deaths straight, but it's frankly emotionally devastating in this game to have your carefully crafted character you're happy with torn away and replaced after just a short acquaintance - besides, who has the time to be constantly making new characters?<br/><br/>My current understanding of what the 4th edition is best suited for in theory terms is participationist simulationism, with the goal of simulating D&amp;D fiction. It's a weirdly self-referential creative agenda, I know, but it seems like the best fit: just like 3rd edition, the game goes to great lengths to provide you with a powerful balancing engine for the sole purpose of enabling a fiction that looks as much as possible like that of older editions of D&amp;D, but without the "rough bits". The players are supposed to enjoy portraying their unique snowflake characters, and the GM is supposed to enjoy driving the plot train for the snowflakes to experience. The combat bits are essentially a massive ritual hearkening back to when D&amp;D had teeth as a challenge-based game; as the books pretty clearly say, the goal is to have some combats that feel like they could go against the characters, but the supposed outcome is that the PCs win, so the real reason for playing through the combats is that we just want to pretend to be challenged. I've been toying with the idea of playing the game by the book one more time one of these days, just to give it a chance with myself in the GM's seat. (I haven't GMed the game yet.) If I do, this participationist simulation angle is going to be where I'll go: instead of ruining the game by being difficult with the players, I'll just roll over on everything pertaining to character portrayal while telling the players to not even bother worrying about the external context of the fights - they're allowed to throw in smart quips and show how their characters react to the events, but I've got the plot roughly planned out, so no point in arguing against the plan. No need to stress out about the fights, either - I'll roll dice and all, but we'll work around any set-backs with last-minute cavalry or other safety rails so that the heroes win the day in the end. I sort of suspect that this'll fall flat if I don't figure out <i>some</i> emotional stakes for the combats, though, so I'll probably make it a two-pronged railroad with a "good" and "bad" ending for any given arc; the player character portrayal won't be endangered, and if they fail it'll be tragic heroic failure on the brink of success, of course.<br/><br/>To sum up: I'm intrigued by the wargame, but I don't see how it hangs together in a roleplaying context without playing it like it's '92 all over again and TSR just published the anniversary edition of the Dragonlance campaign. As far as I can see, the game's roleplaying aspects amount to no more than what you'd get in <i>Warhammer Fantasy Battle</i> - nobody calls that a roleplaying game, but it has the same bullshitting over miniatures (I say this entirely positively - fluffing up a boardgame or such can be great fun alongside playing the game), and the Warhammer "campaign" as explained in the rulebook is essentially the same as a 4th edition adventure: both consist of set-piece combats that are stringed together by plot exposition. The typical standard format Warhammer campaign is the more functional of the two, though, as it's built to assume that either side playing can win any individual battle, and thus there's a clear procedure to follow whatever way the individual combat resolves.<br/><br/>My future plans regarding 4th edition involve playing it seriously when it comes out as a computer game. I like this exact sort of tactics games in computer form, and it's a common frustration for me when I crack out 4th edition that it takes so much time to set up and play, all without providing much more than I'd get from a computer game. A squad skirmish game in the tradition of e.g. <i>U.F.O</i> or <i>Jagged Alliance</i> would in fact provide me with more strategic agency than I get in a tabletop 4th edition session. Something with a simple strategy game to provide context for the skirmish fights would be just excellent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369444/#Comment_369444" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T13:50:50+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  1:50PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 1:52PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was ok.

A computer program written in 10 minutes could adjudicate the actions of every single player optimally so that no battle is ever lost. That's how I felt anyway. There was no strategic depth and the tactical depth was more shallow than many video games. No emergent complexity, no unexpected interactions. Nothing to latch on to. I've been playing a roguelike on the computer called Brogue that offers all sorts of tactical and strategic joys that I won't find in something as needlessly complicated as fourth edition.

I haven't owned any D&amp;D since AD&amp;D and stopped playing the franchise once I got into 'indie' games. I moved 1000's of KM away from my regular group and started boardgaming with my new workmates and new-found friends in a small country town. Some of them had heard of D&amp;D and wanted to give it a try, so I tried the new bunch on Moldvay and they found it 'unfair', though they liked the sandboxy, free-form roleplay parts of the experience. They also be-moaned the lake of tactile experience and things to 'play with'. I brought out some ancient citadel miantures and games workshop tiles from the '80s and they were hooked. <br/><br/>One of the group had seen the D&amp;D boardgames at their FLGS and we gave Wrath of Ashardalon a whirl. The game was full of roleplay and table chatter in character as we worked our way through the dungeon(s). The concensus being that wouldn't it be great if we could have the roleplaying and narrative reward of Moldvay, with the odd tactical excursion provided by the D&amp;D boardgame. The guys <b>loved<i></i></b> the setting and colour of 4e. Despite my giddy reminiscence of B/X and personal immersive love of the D&amp;D world envisioned by Otus, Dee and Willingham, the gang was not of the same mind. I guess a younger more MMORPG set and lavish art appreciation endeared them to the 'world' of 4e. If you ignore the text, and simply imbibe the the layout and art of 4e it is a radically different expression than the typeface and b&amp;w simplicity of Moldvay or AD&amp;D or even a modern mash-up like Dungeon World (which I love love love, and play intermittently with my group of long term roleplayers when I'm back in the Blue Mountains).<br/><br/>So 4e got requested by my regular friday night soir\xe9e. I sat down and had a talk with folks. Some had looked up D&amp;D online and liked the idea of encounters, but our nearest meet was 3 hours drive away, others just wanted to create a character that was 'pretty', a few had read / watched celebrityAP's (that strangely focused on the story rather than min/maxing the tactical game), some liked the idea of their mini being taken 'out of the dungeon'. I think most importantly, the group wanted a change to boardgames. So I bought essentials, picked up a few battlemaps and recycled minis from other games, read Sly Flourish and Chatty DM's blogs with abandon, spoke to Johnzo with my ideas for story gaming 4e and am using his advice wholeheartedly and finally gave it a whirl last week.<br/><br/>WE HAVE HAD THE BEST TIME!!!!! We shared the DDI subscription for a month, made characters online (essentials only), printed off the sheets and some players have transferred these to their own sheets. We have used the Nentir vale /  points of light setting as a sandbox with my using the principles and agenda from DW to 'steer the ship'. We only bring out the battlemap and minis/counters for 'big boss battles or quest finales' and at that point treat everything as per Rob Donohuge's treatise on 'situational HP', and the players know this. They grok the visual representation of the 4 main defences and the obstacles they represent: Circumvent - Reflex, Manipulate - Fortitude, Understand - Will, Smash - Armour Class. We can see the whole 'situation' in this light if required and make role-play connections as determined by the action on the battlemap. This makes it easy for me to prepare that particular encounter(s) ahead of time, whereas all the other 'rolls that matter' are handled as per Chatty DM's take on Skill Challenges, including inconsequential combats. I use an intent and task paradigm, with consequences of failure being spelled out quite extensively. Players help one another through justified skill use with roleplay. Narrative consequences have as much weight as mechanical ones too.<br/><br/>Its almost as if the tactical 'module' of 4e has taken a back seat. We use it when we want to have a board-gamey tactical beat-em-up, and use a fairly basic iteration (as in what's presented in the red box) but don't have to use this if we don't want to. The story-game tension comes from a very 'play to see what happens' style of gaming that focuses on player specified quests and the stakes that revolve around their resolution. Rewards are world exploration and co-authored establishment, player defined quests and the chance to pursue them, unique magical items, levelling up and the superheroic status (and the narrative / story responsibility that comes with this power). Powers are justified as unique superheroic abilities for each character, the player can author this however they like, and they become a fairly valuable resource to be used narratively in as creative a way as possible following Quinn's 'off the grid' concepts. This is all wrapped up within the glorious technocolour feast that is 4e production. The 'Deluxe GM Screen', the cool collectible minis (a few of the players have tapped into this side of things, despite not actually using the minis much, they just like having them as 'toys'), tiles and postermaps and rulebooks.<br/><br/>One thing that has become rather cool is the use of the counters from the Monster Box and the GM box for our relationship map, and location of the characters on the world map. This has seen far more gameplay than actual tactical skirmishry. I really like the wet-erase 'plain' map from pathfinder with all the characters tokens stuck to it with stickytack, relationship lines between other NPCs and villains and their importance noted, quests listed and possible rewards in plain view. We just look at that map at the start of play and ask where do we want to go from here?<br/><br/>In short, I'm glad I waited. If I had started a 4e game when it first arrived on the scene with my regular Burning Wheel gang we would have HATED it. After seeing how systems matter and identifying what your group wants out of a table-top rpg, I've found 4e to be a rather lovable, quirky, grandiose and flamboyant game. It has its warts, but they are far more exorbitant and self-indulgent than the bumps I was used to from Moldvay 'back in the day'. Its still D&amp;D to me; at its core a roleplaying game encapsulated within the mechanical parameters of a skirmish battle game in a fantasy milieu... but the modern, computer game version thereof. I like it, far more than I would have expected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LincolnSmash" title="LincolnSmash"><img alt="LincolnSmash" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LincolnSmash">LincolnSmash</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369530/#Comment_369530" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T18:13:31+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  6:13PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 6:14PM by LincolnSmash.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I could have fun playing it for mini-series type deals.<br/><br/>Not so much for long-term/campaign play.<br/><br/>Weird thing is, it doesn't deliver for me as a player, but I absolutely loved running it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369537/#Comment_369537" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T18:45:16+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  6:45PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played 4E twice plus new Gamma World once.<br/><br/>I thought it was everything that 4E haters say about it - complex, abstract, tactical, no role-playing, lifeless characters.

Everyone was on board with what the game could and couldn't do, and contrary to what others have said, I found setting up encounters and kit-bashing monster to be WAY easier than in 3.5 because of the electronic tools and the modular design. I can take or leave all the power-list splatbooks and hundreds of classes and such, but some of the campaign stuff, particularly <i>Underark</i>, is some of the sharpest and most interesting atmosphere they've done in many years and I stole plenty of good idea from the various setting books.<br/><br/>I stopped trying to create and run my own game worlds years ago, and had the players create a 'gestalt' campaign that had them rising up to become heroes in a big old Bas Lag-type fantasy city. The Heroic/Paragon/Epic structure just worked really well for us, and the fact that the only REQUIREMENT for players to interact with the system is picking their powers meant that the people who wanted to engage the fiction by helping me world-build could, and the people who just wanted to show up and hit things could, too, and the balance that might make the PCs feel generic was a feature for us and not a bug, because it de-emphasized overt system mastery as a requirement for designing an effective character (which in this case meant a character who was fun to play in a combat).<br/><br/>We ran into the usual issues with over-long fights, but they never broke the campaign or anything, and the fact that I had the same players in the game for its entire 3+ year run makes it pretty safe for me to presume they enjoyed it as much as I did.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy playing it in the 'Living' setting as much as I had hoped, and the Encounters setup is by nature not as satisfying (it's mean to be tutorial). I'd happily play it again, either as a DM or player, if I could put a campaign together.<br/><br/>I guess my position is sort of an outlier in that I get paid to play it, and some portion of my livelihood relies on showing people hwy they'd like it, so I have a strong incentive to find what's fun in it and mine that vein hard. As much as I have enjoyed it, my life and job mean that once Next hits, I'll probably retire all my books and switch over exclusively to the new system, because that'll be the new official standard.<br/><br/>But I also play and enjoy tons of different story games, board games, CCGs, and everything else I carry. I have a vested interest in being broadly ecumenical, and my outlook on the game totally reflects that, and I understand it's a burden/luxury not everyone has.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369557/#Comment_369557" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T19:52:31+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  7:52PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah. I had a bad experience with it, mostly I think because I had a less than experienced DM running a pretty bad module: or at least, the module was a straight-up dungeon slog, with room-to-room combat characters, and pretty much no opportunities for meaningful character choices. Even at the tactical level, it was usually pretty obvious: "Oh, look, a fire pit. Okay, time to use my controller makes-enemies-move power to draw dudes into it" or "Oh, a group of minions! Encounter area attack power there, then." It didn't help that, as I said, our DM was a little inexperienced and thus a bit less comfortable with us running off the rails, for example when our Drow Priestess (who had fallen from Lloth's service) tried to fool some of the monsters into thinking we were a new Evil Faction coming to join the dungeon, he pretty much ignored the bluff roll as OOC kibitzing and went straight to initiative (rather than, at the very least, saying "Holy shit, the drow are trying to take over! Attack!") It made trying anything outside of a straight up fight feel about as effective as chatting monsters up in Diablo II. "Hey, Butcher. I'm an necromancer tainted with unholy energies, you don't want MY meat!" That bit somebody else said about how the fiction didn't matter, yeah, I felt that a lot, and while I don't blame only the system, I can't help but notice it was a bigger problem than when that same person ran other games.<br/><br/>There are things, that others have mentioned, that I like about the game: the basic assumption that everyone has to have something to bring to combat, the "points of light" setting conceit, certain bits and pieces of the cosmology and mythology (like others have said, The Raven Queen is pretty awesome, and I'll always be a Pelor fanboy because he'll always secretly be the Burning Hate in my headcanon) and I've recently dug a lot of the stuff I've read about Fourthcore so if somebody were to, say, run Crucible of the Gods at GPNW I'd totally be in on that, but as a long-running campaign? Er, how about Dungeon World instead?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369562/#Comment_369562" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-27T21:07:13+00:00" title="March 27, 2012  9:07PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2012 9:13PM by J_Walton.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4E was the first version of D&amp;D I tried to engage in any serious way.  I grew up playing Palladium stuff (Robotech, Rifts, Palladium Fantasy) and I think I played AD&amp;D2 once at Boy Scout camp (but not really) and tried a session or two of this 3E campaign my friend Eric ran around the time 4E came out, but I had him make my character for me (since we were starting at 10th level and I really couldn't be bothered with picking from hundreds of feats).<br/><br/>I was really excited about the buzz, both good and bad. A lot of indie folks had liked Iron Heroes and this seemed more in that vein. Having everyone be badass and having everything take place on the combat grid seemed cool. The "battle chess"-like tactics seemed super cool, as did the ability to help your fellow players be more badass. On the surface, it seemed like they were cutting out all the stuff about D&amp;D that had been wishy-washy and focusing on the core of the game (i.e. going into dungeons and killing dragons). I had no real attachment to anything that D&amp;D had been.<br/><br/>Then we tried to play <i>Keep on the Shadowfell</i> and it sucked so hard. All the design choices in that module are terrible for showing people the game.  The first encounter is <b>meaningless fight</b> with no real danger or stakes on a  <b>featureless open field</b> and <b>uses monsters that mess with the basic tactical choices</b> in the game (shifting kobolds). I couldn't believe it.  Why would any designer make these choices? Were they trying to drive people away from the game? And there were several more really boring and frustrating encounters before you actually go into the dungeon, taking several hours, so you couldn't even do anything involving dungeons or dragons in the first session of play. Then, if you actually got to the real dungeon that the module was named after (the Keep on the Shadowfell, which you only got to after something like 6 sessions of play, it seemed, after a meaningless side mission against somebody else), <b>there was no map included, so you couldn't actually play the dungeon</b>. I mean, I'm not saying I know how to design D&amp;D, but the module totally failed to pass basic requirements in product design.<br/><br/>But, I decided, maybe 4E could be really cool if I designed the adventure myself and put a lot of time and creativity into it.  I actually thought a lot of the video game stuff was really cool, which gave me the idea for a campaign I wanted to run.  In the meantime, I worked with the Evil Hat guys on <i>Hard-Boiled Cultures</i>, a module for making 4E more culturally and ethnically colorful in a AD&amp;D2 sort or way (presaging the stuff Hans and I are doing for the Planarch Codex for Dungeon World, really). I was convinced that 4E could be awesome, even if WOTC wasn't making it easy or obvious.  Dev and I spent a month trading 4E dungeon concepts back and forth between our blogs.  We were still really excited to make it happen, despite some negative early experiences.<br/><br/>I spent hours and hours hacking this Zelda map into a papercraft dungeon with moving platforms, interactive puzzles, treasure chests that actually opened, and a giant stingray boss that flooded the entire dungeon (making you flip the whole thing over to reveal flooded rooms).  I was super psyched about it initially and posted <a href="http://corvidsun.com/2009/07/30/jaywalts-guide-to-making-16-bit-maps/" rel="nofollow">a guide to making 16-bit maps for 4E</a>.  I even planned to make a new product along with Evil Hat / One Bad Egg called <a href="http://corvidsun.com/2009/06/21/hard-boiled-pixels/" rel="nofollow">Hard-Boiled Pixels</a>, all about <a href="http://corvidsun.com/2009/06/24/hard-boiled-pixels-2/" rel="nofollow">using 4E to play old school video game-style adventures</a>.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://corvidsun.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/de-flamingrug.jpg"/><br/><br/>Then we tried to play my papercraft Zelda dungeon. It was gorgeous and exciting at first. We were all so into the concept that it carried us through the early encounters, which were fine but not anything special. Took us three sessions to get through a four-room dungeon, which was WAY slower than I expected.  We ended up quitting after four sessions and, <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9591" rel="nofollow">as I wrote in this thread</a>, my conclusion was:\n<blockquote>Also, ultimately, after our fourth and final session of this mini-campaign today, I have to say that, in the end, I've been substantially disappointed with 4th Edition overall, not in the ways it handled the 16-bit hacking (those were fine) but just as a game system that was fun to play in an of itself. Generally speaking, the stuff I found really exciting and interesting about our play had very little to do with the mechanics of D&amp;D (it was stuff we brought to the table ourselves) and, when we did engage the mechanics, they frequently served to make the game less fun instead of more fun. So my conclusion is basically: 16-bit maps and sprites for fantasy roleplaying are AWESOME, but I'm less convinced of the awesome of 4th. To be fair, I'm even less convinced of the awesome of 3.0/3.5, so it may be that these two styles of D&amp;D just aren't my thing.<br/><br/>Still, there do seem to be a lot of problems in 4th that seem to be fundamental, rather than just judgment calls. Fights turn into 6+ round slogs very easily, even at low levels. Level-appropriate encounters don't seem to be very exciting at all, period. Certain subsystems of the game (healing, concealment) seem to never really materialize unless you go out of your way to emphasize them. Prep is insanely time consuming considering the amount of enjoyment that comes out of it. Assigning magic items and treasure is purely arbitrary and way too much work. Skill challenges are really poorly designed. Etc. I realize this may be old news to lots of people, but this is the first time I've gotten to do substantial play of D&amp;D (of any variety) and I have to admit that I'm shocked by how much the game is lacking in basic guidelines on how to effectively run and play it. You can't simply create a level appropriate encounter, throw it on the map, and expect to have a good time, but improvizing and hacking level-appropriate material is both time consuming and difficult. Maybe I just need to play it more or something, but I feel like a game that I don't "get" after 4 sessions of play is asking for too much of a commitment without promising substantial payoff in the end.</blockquote>\nI gave away all my 4E stuff when I moved out to Seattle 3 years ago. I miss some things about it, like how awesome it felt to create a capable and badass fantasy character and the cool dungeonpunk vibe (even if a lot of people seemed to dislike it), but I'm pretty sure I can replicate that with the Planarch Codex in Dungeon World. I've heard really good things about Essentials seemingly fixing some of the stuff that was frustrating about the original books, but I'm not sure I'm willing to invest a bunch of time and creativity again, just to see.  Still, I've bookmarked Johnzo's thread on how he runs it and there's some part of me that wants to give it another shot. There's definitely a bunch of interesting stuff there; I just wished the product was designed so enjoyable play was easier to achieve, right out of the books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369617/#Comment_369617" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T06:27:17+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  6:27AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started playing D&amp;D with BECMI when I was 9, and have played at least a little of every edition that's been out since.  Overall, I think 4E was the most fun I had since the BECMI days with any version of the game, and since I was, like, 9-12 when we played BECMI and 1st Ed. AD&amp;D, a lot of that is probably nostalgia for being a kid - we certainly didn't have as careful and complicated a game as folks reminisce about in OSR discussions (we *did* have lots of crazy maps drawn on graph paper with magic markers, and a seven-headed dragon that could spit each type of slime).<br/><br/>For me, 4E came along when I was already pretty well-immersed in indie games, so I think part of what made it enjoyable was that I was interested in taking it for what it was.  If I wanted deep thoughtful character development, or moral challenges, I knew about Dogs in the Vineyard, or Burning Wheel, or Sorcerer.  4E was Fantasy Action Heroes, with cool fight scenes strung together with just enough plot to give them context, and I was down with that. I had a lot of fun as a player poring over character optimization threads, and a ton of fun as a DM coming up with wacky monsters and terrain to use (Goblins on hoverbikes! Rotating platforms! Evil dwarves in power armor!).  Unlike Adam, who was involved in a lot of the games I was involved in, I *loved* the gonzo and mythic elements, where giants were principles of nature and my Dragonborn Paladin could have some completely impractical looking barbed sword.  <br/><br/>Practically... I ended up playing a lot.  Right when 4E came out, I ran a limited campaign with some old friends set in a Final Fantasy-esque setting, where from the start we planned to play for only four sessions and advance dramatically between them (so we went to level 10), to get a taste for the system.  Once we worked out some glitches, like everyone figuring out that Strikers heading off on their own didn't work well, it was fun!  We played with a lot of the OBE material - one session was a clash of Hard-Boiled armies, we had a Half-Dead Shaman PC and an Apelord Ranger, etc.  We even had one really extended skill challenge that was pretty basic but draped in lots of color and driving Metallica music (it was a chase scene through a crazy dungeon) that I thought was fun at least.  This was also around the time that Adam Dray ran his Metrocalypse game (that unfortunately sorta petered out after the Bullywug conversion) and a really short-lived game set in a world based on the Renaissance that was a cool setup but I hated several of the other players, so I personally wasn't sorry to see it go but can't blame it on the system.<br/><br/>The Baltimore-area gaming meetup organized a West-Marches-style sandbox that I started as a player in (and, especially with the DM for a lot of that time period, had a lot of the stuff people talk about liking from OSR - tricks and traps and only very rough "balance" [we knew that, generally, as you got farther from the home base town, things got more dangerous] and a TPK when I convinced the rest of the party that it was a totally good idea to try to walk into the magical painting depicting the Shadowfell - usurprisingly, this guy went on to do a lot of Fourthcore) and ended up DMing for.  In principle, it was a multi-DM thing, but in practice it ended up more that when one DM would get burned out, someone else would take over.  We played a lot with interesting set-piece encounters, some of which worked better than others (jumping off of trees to hit the flying dragon was awesome, trying to cross the Frogger-esque river full of fast-moving logs kinda fell flat).  When Dark Sun came out, I was getting burned out on the generic game, and most of the regulars were cool with us starting a Dark Sun sandbox (The Waste) that was also pretty cool, but died when I and the other regular DM got too busy/wanted to move on to running other stuff and there was no one ready to step up.<br/><br/>After that, I mostly ended up playing D&amp;D because there wasn't anyone around here running anything else.  I have a friend who's just honestly not interested in any other systems, and he ran some pretty fun stuff I played in, but it ended up feeling like a slog since the other players weren't interested in Stepping On Up, and that was the interesting part of D&amp;D for me.  I love playing Warlords, but the only way I could get a lot of them to capitalize on the opportunities I spent time setting up was to basically be that dick who was like, "here, give me your character sheet - do this now."  And when I tried to relax and just go with the flow, the game wasn't that challenging, and the other players weren't interested in pushing the bounds of deep characterization either (we ended up with everyone sort of following my PC's storyline not because it was interesting, but because I was the only PC with plans).  So I sort of drifted away from the games, and found enough people to play in games I was more interested in (though still, finding someone to *run* something else I can *play* has been a bust).<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the moral of the story is.  I loved 4E when I got to play it as a tactical game with enough RP to color things up.  IME, the color and the tactics rarely were in tension.  It wasn't like some people were worried about AoO and others wanted to talk about their guy's feelings about his father.  It was the tactically-engaged players who were also like, "I grab the orc by the throat and hurl him into the fire, putting my boot on his neck as he screams in surprise!" and the ones who didn't know their sheets who were like, "OK, I push him 1 into the fire.  He's prone."  I'm totally sympathetic to folks who think it doesn't support other things terribly well - I don't see it as standing in their way, but yeah, if I want lots of RP I'm going to reach for Burning Wheel, not D&amp;D4E (or D&amp;D2E, for that matter).  I loved the crunchy, fluff-lite sourcebooks, because I had my own fictional material but no time to playtest mechanics for balance (as witness my custom dwarven warriors with an ability to play pinball with prone PCs, which ended up being surprisingly dangerous).<br/><br/>In the end, the bit that makes me more want to get rid of my 4E books isn't anything about the game as a game, but an increasingly bad taste in my mouth about the "helpless orc babies" stuff.  Right now, I'm not sure how much I want to play games where violence is unproblematic and lauded and cool.  My four-year-old is fascinated by my miniatures, but I'm pretty sure if/when I introduce her to gaming, it won't be through some version of D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369623/#Comment_369623" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T07:07:00+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  7:07AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bought in to 4e when it was coming out, mostly because it was D&amp;D and also because I'd heard it was a version tht finally really integrated minis play with the openness of RPGing.<br/><br/>I played it a couple of times, played two of the boardgames (Ravenloft and Ashdarlon) based on it, and very briefly tried givng Gamma World a whirl.<br/><br/>My final assessment: This stuff sucks as both an RPG and a minis play vehicle.

I was used to treating the advice in the book like a procedure, so I didn't consider an encounter "ready" until it had a map, terrain features, monsters that complemented each other, and properly chosen rewards that fed the plot.

The husband is seriously into the tactical crunch of the game and the wife, while she loves story, is convinced she can't portray a character well and so also focuses on the mechanics and combat crunch.  So when 4th ed came out, they jumped on it hard and we were fine with taking the new ride out for a spin.<br/><br/>I still feel that any game that let's my wizard cast unlimited magic missiles is OK by me.  I loved that first level characters weren't fragile china dolls and that we could skip the walking on eggshells feeling that came with being one kobold dagger thrust away from death for the first few sessions.  The tactical crunch did make combat interesting and I loved figuring out how to coordinate our abilities to awesome effect.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, the other couple dropped the game after a few sessions.  They disliked the sameness of the characters.  The little of this, little of that style of 3rd ed character development appealed to them more.  They preferred the variety of 3rd ed to the equality of 4th ed and I have to say that having switched with them I rather agree.  <br/><br/>The story aspects, or lack thereof, in 4th edition didn't really come up as a plus or a minus since I was going into the experience expecting cool fight scenes and not much else.  Several of our sessions were actually playtesting a dungeon based on WoW raid the couple really liked.  So on the whole, while I wasn't thrilled with it, I'd certainly play again if asked.  Because I still get unlimited magic missiles and the novelty of that has not worn off yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369662/#Comment_369662" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T09:11:33+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  9:11AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK,<br/>\n  So I have played D&amp;D 4e a few times. Across maybe 4 or 5 levels. Both as DM'ing and playing.<br/>\n  Initially, I had zero interest in this game. I played the living hell out of D&amp;D between 1981 and 1991 and just am not that excited to play it anymore. It isn't really a matter of hating it or thinking it is backwards or whatever, it is just a matter of I have played enough of it.<br/>\n  But, there was a post or two about D&amp;D 4e on Story Games and another friend of mine really wanted to play it, so I decided to give it a shot.<br/>\n  First, the Character Building Tool is genius. I don't know how far I would have gotten if this tool was not available. Also, it made me want to DM D&amp;D for the first time in something like 20 years. I could easily cook up bad guys who were not in the Monster Manual (which is far more interesting to me as a DM).<br/>\n  Second, the classes are balanced. This has always been a pain point for me, because I like playing magic dudes, but D&amp;D has always made it hard to do and have fun. I feel like they fixed that.<br/>\n  Third, more than any other edition I have played, this forces you to use a map and figures (I didn't feel this way at all about Basic, Advanced or even 3.5, FYI). The effects are not expressed in real world terms, but in map terms. And some of the rules makes sense in a map but are hard to describe in real world terms. I am thinking of Blast 3 I think, the one where you make a 3x3 grid that is touching your character.<br/>\n  Forth, the one thing that I think is a MAJOR accomplishment is that fights seemed to take the same amount of time regardless of level. This has always been the bane of D&amp;D, as you leveled up, the fights would get longer and longer. The way they scaled the powers, feats, damage, defense, etc. works great on keeping the fights consistent at all levels<br/>\n  Finally, I probably will not play it again, it is still D&amp;D and I have still played a ton of it, but I do understand what the fun of it is for other people.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/asurber" title="asurber"><img alt="asurber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/asurber">asurber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369698/#Comment_369698" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T10:54:47+00:00" title="March 28, 2012 10:54AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2012 1:12PM by asurber.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1st and 2nd edition of AD&amp;D are the games that got me started in Role-playing.  I've played about 5 session of D&amp;D 4E.  I enjoyed it because it was a game that I could play with people that don't usually play RPGs because they have heard of it.  If I were I were choose I'd use Fate or TSoY as an introductory game to new players. <br/><br/>I did enjoy how they set up saves in 4E, where attacks are against those saves as if they were an AC.  The core system mechanics except for skill challenges are very clean, which once you get beyond making character, makes it a good game to teach.  <br/><br/>In 4E I found character creation to still be too complicated and not lead to individual characters.  I liked the power system until I played and then it turned into a video game use your power until you win,  I found 4E power system lacked creativity and did not encourage it.  Players did what they knew they could do, but never tried crazy stuff, like we did in early games to beat the monster or solve a puzzle.  I also found the powers where almost the same across classes just different in color. <br/><br/>I never realized how much I hate tactical war-game style combat until I played 4E. I admit I can enjoy a war-game when that is the focus like in battle-tech; where we get together knowing we are just going to kill, and fight with each other.  When the Idea of the game is that your a team adventuring, exploring, and telling a story, I felt 4E left no space for that to occur, it was just combat focused.  It takes 4 hours to run two to three encounters in 4E which leaves no time for other aspects of play in the game. What you do between combats other then rest or heal had no effect on the next combat.  Even the Skill Challenges seemed a bit contrived, and never seemed to be used to improve the game play.  <br/><br/>So for me if I want a fantasy game, I'll grab TSoY(Solar System), HeroQuest, Sorcerer, Fate, Kiss My Axe, Becoming Heroes, PDQ# or the the like before I'll pick up 4E again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369729/#Comment_369729" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T12:08:47+00:00" title="March 28, 2012 12:08PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It does BIG well: big set scenes, big set battles, big heroes, big villains, big fights, big stakes.<br/><br/>I'm glad I played it.

Plus I did a big pile of playtesting for Dungeon Construction Kit (which may yet be published some day, but D&amp;Dnext has certainly put a crimp in its style -- or may yet be its saviour).  <br/><br/>There was a lot to like.  The powers, for both creatures and PCs, made space for lots of coolness that couldn't be expressed easily in earlier D&amp;Ds.  But I think powers work better as the exception than as the default (ie, there should be standard rules that apply to most attacks/defenses/etc., and powers should be exceptional).  <br/><br/>I hated Skill Challenges.  Sure, you could role-play within them.  You could even get great role-play.  But, as both player and GM, it was <b>work</b> to make them anything other than an exercise in number-crunching.  <br/><br/>As Andy said, "tactical combat system just took up too much of the mindspace of the rules and the players."  The longer game I played in had a number of great role players in it.  Yet, <i>for three consecutive sessions,</i> we did nothing other than set up the battle mat and hack it out.  <br/><br/>Finally, Eero nailed my biggest problem with it:  it eliminated the strategic and operational levels, and relentlessly focused on the tactical.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369903/#Comment_369903" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T00:46:51+00:00" title="March 29, 2012 12:46AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When 4e came out, I was still in a regular group with John Harper, Tony Dowler, Brandon Amancio, and Ryan Dunleavy, and we played it weekly through that summer. Everyone but I took a turn as DM.<br/><br/>John and Brandon actually ran simultaneous large setpiece battles at GPNW 2008, a week before the game came out, but unfortunately I wasn't able to get in on those games. However, later that week John did run a one-off session for us (plus Doug), and I got to play the eladrin fey-pact warlock, who I believe was a pre-gen from the pre-release kit that they'd used at GPNW. I thought the eladrin warlock was a lot of fun, and it made me very excited to play.<br/><br/>As John said, when we started our regular game, he'd established several house rules dealing with earning and spending action points and dealing with skill challenges that proved to be key to keeping the game enjoyable. (If you look at <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2008_06_01_archive.html" rel="nofollow">his blog archive for June 2008</a>, you can find some of them there.) These changes were key for two reasons: one, they replaced weak or uninteresting rules with strong rules that made the game more interesting (by giving us more options or more ways to engage the system); and two, they actually helped to make the game more challenging rather than less. Adding to the ways that we could spend action points, for example, made us more willing to take on seemingly impossible odds and go for the big win, which was more fun and exciting all around. <br/><br/>In the regular game series, we were all servants of the Raven Queen, and even though we were low-level characters, John established up front that any higher-level servants had been slain or destroyed by Vecna, the Queen's chief opponent in this setting. That put us at the center of the action, which was a lot of fun, and we collaborated on coming up with cool setting details. On the one hand, like previous editions, 4e had the strength of being the default fantasy setting for fantasy RPGs, making it flexible and easy to adapt to our ideas. On the other hand, as other people in this thread have mentioned, in the books themselves there's practically no color at all to the point of being too bland and uninteresting. I do really like some of the meager setting details of the new edition, such as the change in the setup of the planes that resulted in the combination of the Feywild and the Shadowfell. But overall, the difference between the previous editions and this one as far as character and setting goes is like the (visual) difference between brand-name soup stock (Campbell's, Progresso, and so on) and generic black-lettering-on-white-label SOUP. <br/><br/>As far as characters go, I started the regular game with a tiefling warlock (also fey-pact, IIRC), but I found I just couldn't get interested in the character and didn't enjoy it as much as the eladrin warlock. So after a session or two, I switched to playing a human cleric, choosing that mainly because we needed that role filled. Fortunately, I found it to be fairly enjoyable, and got to do some cool stuff with Turn Undead in a climactic battle in the Raven Queen's throne room. I still really wanted to play an eladrin warlock again, though, and even had one statted up and ready to play. However, that role was already filled, and when we switched DMs around, John and Ryan convinced me to give a paladin a try as that was now the role we needed in the party. That worked okay for me story-wise as I'd had an idea of playing a warforged paladin, which we decided was the embodied (and imprisoned) shell of a god that the Raven Queen had claimed, and that was cool. However, I found the paladin (defender role) even less enjoyable than I had my tiefling warlock. So on the one hand, I think the defined character roles is a good idea particularly for this tactical-battle version of D&amp;D, and on the other hand I was willing to try out these characters I was less interested in, for the sake of party balance, and found that sure enough I just didn't enjoy them so much. <br/><br/>I definitely liked some of the design choices such as defining everyone's abilities as powers available in a tiered system (at-will/encounter/daily), and making sure even a first-level wizard always has a good effective combat option instead of trying to devise some new way to hide from combat or otherwise figure out a way not to be completely helpless. <br/><br/>As I said, I never ended up taking a turn as DM, mainly because I never felt ready and willing to give it a try before we collectively lost interest in the game. Looking back at it now, even though the game supposedly made it easy to create encounters, I think I would've felt hard pressed to come up with anything that I would think measured up to what the others had already done, and I don't believe I would've been happy running the game at all.<br/><br/>And now that I've spent all this time thinking about the game\u2026 Johnzo's game sounds like a hell of a lot of fun, and I could imagine playing again in that game or others, but I'm also thinking about just giving away my 4e books\u2014maybe keeping the Player's Handbook just in case, but I can't imagine that I'll ever need the DM's Guide or Monster Manual that I have, and the Manual of the Planes was just disappointingly flat and mundane-feeling compared to the earlier editions.<br/><br/>Finally, as for the board game versions, I've played Wrath of Ashardalon a few times, and I found it quickly bored me. Apparently taking that one extra step toward making 4e an actual board game was just too much for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid" title="SavageHominid"><img alt="SavageHominid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SavageHominid">SavageHominid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369907/#Comment_369907" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T01:18:07+00:00" title="March 29, 2012  1:18AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A ran a bit of pick-up D&amp;D 4e at an old game store.<br/><br/>It has been the only I game I could easily run fast combats with 8+ people.

I had pretty negative preconceptions from previous 3.5 games and they were pretty much fulfilled.<br/><br/>The game was apparently usually quite fun, although with frequent very tactic-heavy combats where each character played a very specific role (tank, healer, etc.). The game I played was midway through a published dungeon scenario and in four hours we did nothing other than move little figures on a (quite pretty) map, roll dice and basically I tried to figure out the optimal moves for my character so I didn't let the 'team' down. Basically no in-character roleplaying, just a miniatures skirmish game. We all got our arses kicked, then tried going back into the dungeon after some time spent resting and healing and had another, equally unsuccessful go. However, it wasn't the losing that bugged me, I was bored out of my skull for 3/4 of the time.<br/><br/>These guys are some of the most interesting, fun roleplayers I know, but for them, 4E was scratching a different, almost boardgamey itch than other games we usually played. That itch is not something I enjoy in RPGs, so it really fulfilled my preconceptions that it isn't the game for me.<br/><br/>Of course, that's only having played the one time. But on the other hand, there are lots of games out there, and if 4E was so totally not fun for me on one session, there seemed little point in persevering with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369951/#Comment_369951" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T07:52:25+00:00" title="March 29, 2012  7:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love and am dissapointed with 4E.  I think it was an important step in the process and I wasnt so much disappointed with 4e as I was the gaming community.  Honestly I think that 4e is a superior game in every way.  I think that it delivers the same sort of thing that 90% of D&amp;D players are experiencing and the only problem is that they didn't try to engage the game or just play the game they were playing with a more robust battle system.  Even if the combat wasn't perfect it was a far cry better than any iteration before it in terms of balance and making the combats more engaging. <br/><br/>So I played in four D&amp;D 4e games.  One was a home game that I ran for a few sessions.  We were ulitmatley trying to figure out combat and think about the system more than plan a long term game.  I also played a few encounters building up to Dark Sun (of which I ran about half the games).  I played in a Dark Sun campaign that I had to leave due to scheduling conflicts and I ran a few games at conventions with my vision of what 4e was and could be if folks gave it a chance.  I recall really getting into playing my Minotaur Monk and it falling flat because everyone was focused on just getting to the combats.<br/><br/>I really was stoked about 4e.  I like the visuals and I liked what they were doing with setting.  Most of all I liked the idea that "look guys you all have your own worlds, why not just play those and we'll supply the rules."  I thought this was brilliant and I was totally on board.  I heard griping from the start and realized what was going on.  There were folks that had been playing D&amp;D for ages - 3e for a decade - and they looked at the big shelf of books and thought "I dont want to get rid of these."  For many there was enough distance between 2e and 3e that the old books were nostalgic and so it was nice to take a deep breath and get into the new and shiny.  Heck, I felt 3e was such a better game mechanically so I didn't understand what people were holding on to other than house rules and a system they were comfortable with.  But after the deluge of 3e and 3.5 books (btw there was a huge stink about 3.5 and people knuckled under but by then, I think, WOTC burned all their social currency) it was harder to just port everything over.  <br/><br/>So when I sat down at tables I got a lot of wierd input.  I had a few experiences, some from people that had never played 3e.  Namely people were just interacting with the combat.  They weren't looking at the whole of the game and how it could be used, instead they saw that player powers had to do with how to move around the board and that created a strange disconnect with the game they'd always played.  I have been in many-a D&amp;D game over three decades where not a single die was rolled.  Everyone said it was still D&amp;D and everyone was having fun.  On occasion someone would say I want to do X and the GM would be like "roll a D20."  Funny that folks looked at this in a different way.  Now your magiciness was either in powers (combat) or Rituals and with all the color removed thats all players focused on.  I feel like if the power descriptions weren't there there wouldn't be as big of a deal.  <br/><br/>Star War SAGA didn an interesting thing to have existing feats and powers react differently in space combat and different situations.  I took this and said "okay lets ignoe the numbers for just a minute and describe how this power can be used outside the scope of the battle mat.  So I ran a game that had zero combat on a map.  If the players wanted a combat they could roll for one but fighting was mostly roleplaying and stakes setting.  I ran most of the game out of the DMG.  Where it says players need to know the consequences and skill challenges and where experience is awarded, etc.  I ran a few of these sessions at Dexcon one year.  It worked really well.  I had players creating elements of the game by answering questions in the midst of an inter-player-character conflict.  The team with the most questions answered at the end of the session won the conflict.  They would each get an opportunity, based on initiative rolls, to interact with one another and the setting.  They tried talking things out and they rolled Nature and Arcane etc to learn more about the situation and plug into the setting.  By the end the groups figured out what was going on and a team was the victor and they had a cool cinematic ending of their creation.  It was really rewarding and I was really happy running those games.  <br/><br/>I felt like when people tried "playing the game as written" they took this wierd leap on what the game was about and how it was not an RPG.  Of course because the playtests focused way more on the PHB and not at all on the DMG this gave early players the opportunity to make up their minds and, to some degree, make up their minds for the community at large.  I took the game as written and played it mostly as we'd played D&amp;D before (granted I brought way more of my current storygame play style to the table than what I would have done over a decade ago - holy shit I have been playing BW for almost a decade...weird - but I can easily see how most of the 3e games could be run in 4e.  They weren't..  Again, weird.<br/><br/>I dont play much D&amp;D 4e now.  For two reasons... I am a BW junkie and it gives me what I need right now.  I tend to play games that are eccelectic and I do a lot of design so I end up playing games that my friends design and playtest my own crap.  I only have time for one regular game it's BW... did I mention junkie?  If I had the time and I gamed as much as I used to I would totally be running Dark Sun right now in 4e.  I love the stuff.  I am a little sad that it just wasn't given the chance I think it deserved and it's interesting that I watch so many people unwilling or interested in inserting the flavor they took out (and told players to add themselves).<br/><br/>I will say while 4e petering out (I never got into Essentials) after Dark Sun was disappointing I felt like I'd had enough of the books.  There was getting to be too many possibilities.  I was down with most of the races and choices and I liked the matrix of "a role choice for every source."  I loved the character generator and I thought it was cool what it did for third party production (I wonder if anyone ever tried to ask WOTC to include their stuff in the generator).  I don't know when I will get back to Dark Sun but if I play it in D&amp;D it would be in my favorite of the systems - 4e.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_370004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat" title="SabreCat"><img alt="SabreCat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://cheri.shyou.org/~sabrecat/images/msuttner-storygames_tani.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SabreCat">SabreCat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370004/#Comment_370004" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T12:27:44+00:00" title="March 29, 2012 12:27PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 29, 2012 12:29PM by SabreCat.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is D&amp;D 4e to me? The only edition of D&amp;D I've consistently enjoyed playing or running.<br/><br/>By way of comparison/context:<br/><br/>BECMI introduced me to formalized roleplaying, i.e., using dice and character sheets and whatnot instead of ad hoc let's-pretend. Playing it was a period of initial excitement--I really dug the solo adventure intro stuff--followed by a series of disappointments. I was disappointed when rolling up a character gave me something entirely different from what I was looking forward to playing. I was disappointed when all the graph-paper mapping the game told us to do turned out to be no fun at all. I was disappointed when the first game I tried running ended in a TPK with everyone paralyzed and eaten by the first monster to appear in the adventure. Never played again.<br/><br/>AD&amp;D 2e was unremarkable, unmemorable. The only game of it I really remember was a delve into Castle Ravenloft where one of the players had read about all the hazards in the place and twinked out his character to be ready for all of them. Maybe there was a cool game to be seen, but I never ran into it. I enjoyed the Baldur's Gate computer games based on it, though.<br/><br/>The next edition I played, I don't remember how it's classified. It had a boxed set with a folder of cards that walked you through learning the game. I enjoyed the boardgame setup, running my friends through the first dungeon, though it lost its luster when we got to the point where you're supposed to start tracking encumbrance for all the gold you pick up. The first scenario ends at a trapdoor, beyond which the DM is supposed to build out a dungeon of his own with a white dragon in it. I started working on that, but grew numb rolling on all the charts, and it got shelved.<br/><br/>3.0/3.5, like AD&amp;D2, left little impression on me. I remember enjoying the idea of picking out a Prestige Class and building your character toward attaining it, then becoming disillusioned when I realized it'd be years of play before I ever achieved those prereqs, and it was highly unlikely we'd play that long. I remember playing a spellcaster and failing, session after session, to guess what spells would be useful for the day's adventuring. Again, maybe there was a cool game waiting to be found, but I sucked at it so bad that I didn't enjoy it much.<br/><br/>By the time D&amp;D4 came out, though, I'd had some experience with story games, and brought those techniques and analysis to bear. I recognized that the game was first and foremost built to deliver a fun board-game combat experience--imagine that, a D&amp;D that chooses something to be about, and designs to it!--and told my players up front, "This is going to be like a video game. I'm planning to play that up all the way, with quest journals, loot drops, boss battles, and the like." It worked pretty well! People didn't fret too much about the verisimilitude of "powers" and whatnot, because, well, they're video game tropes, you roll with them.<br/><br/>I also "storygamed it up." I don't care for the traditional GM-player divide with players having control of nothing outside the reach of their respective characters , so I introduced some new rules to allow PC players to introduce new setting elements, NPCs, plot twists, etc. using a deck of special cards. I expanded on the idea of "personal quests" to get some Flags action in there. And I periodically (some two or three times per tier) ran RP-heavy, situation-based sessions using Conflict Webs.<br/><br/>As a non-GM player, I enjoyed this edition more than any previous one too. I played an Artful Dodger Rogue from 1st through 20th level, and got a huge kick out of the turn-by-turn maneuvering, developing the character build, and acquiring and mastering more and more tricks and tactics as the character progressed. I had some memorable character development and RP moments too, which dovetailed nicely with the effective use of powers, items, and teamwork to deal with the tactical situation at hand. It had the pleasure of dropping a clever card combo in Magic: The Gathering or Ascension, but with the ongoing story, character banter, and social context I love from RPGs.<br/><br/>To say I "consistently," "reliably" enjoyed the game is not to say it's been perfect, though. I definitely had some sessions that did not work, from both sides of the screen. The main problem was grind: battles taking way too long due to poor encounter design, a DM choosing to drag out a foregone conclusion all the way to last-man-standing, and/or players who deliberated too long over their moves for the turn (reflective more of a poor match of player preferences to the game being played than any criticism of the players themselves). The bloat in character management due to way too many, mostly crappy feats and magic items is simply inexcusable. And most DMs I know, self included, have implemented some manner of house rules to deal with the facepalm-inducing math errors in the levelup progression.<br/><br/>To sum up, D&amp;D4 is the edition I'll remember fondly, the only one I'll have nostalgia for. I'm considering the idea of, when Next comes out, giving 4e the OSR treatment and writing a game that codifies and enhances all the tweaks, houserules, and informal play procedures that made it work for me, while fixing the fundamental flaws in the game I can no longer ignore. (4e's weaksauce use of fictional positioning, for instance.) I like to think I'm not a "fanboy", since I do notice and acknowledge those very real failures of the game. But when it comes to edition loyalty, this is the one I stand by, and I'd say I like it, warts and all, more than I do even a number of indie favorites!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_370104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moleculo" title="moleculo"><img alt="moleculo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/874/n4G37MA34HKP8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moleculo">moleculo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/370104/#Comment_370104" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-29T22:42:09+00:00" title="March 29, 2012 10:42PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in a monthly game for about a year and had a good deal of fun at first. I loved the interconnectedness of the character abilities, how it made combats an easily collaborative experience. I found myself often thinking about tactics with my fellow players, plotting out our next turns, looking to each other for that assist or buff or healing or flank. But slowly I got bored with it, and I think much of that came from I was expecting too much from it, loved racing all over the surface of the thing but yearned to get in deeper, which just wasn't happening. I was pained by this because I wanted to enjoy it more. I was later gratified that (unlike 3/3.5e) I only invested in buying the Player's Handbook and some spell cards for my Cleric but leaving even those behind left me a bit sad.<br/><br/>Much later I played Wrath of Ashardalon and most everything that was fun to me about 4e came back in one big rush without it pretending to be something more. And that has been cool. I've got my 4e... it's a fun board game I pull out when I want to scratch that particular itch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fictionalbeing" title="fictionalbeing"><img alt="fictionalbeing" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fictionalbeing">fictionalbeing</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374245/#Comment_374245" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-24T14:59:35+00:00" title="April 24, 2012  2:59PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experiences were varied.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me start with, I started gaming with a mish-mosh of Basic D&amp;D and AD&amp;D back in the late 70's early 80's and then moved on to other games. Leaving D&amp;D behind because it didn't feel like a "role playing game", whatever that means. When 3.0 came out, I came back to the fold for a short while, but didn't love the game or the D20 glut that happened. Fast Forward. 4e comes out and my playing group and I bash the images that herald its release. Cards? What is this thing a boardgame? Insert various other jokes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what the heck, I'm an RPG crackhead so I gave it a shot. Started playing not long after the game came out in a 2-shot. Didn't like it all that much. I had a severe problem with the games approach (from my perspective) of abstraction vs. simulation. Funny thing - don't like 3.5/Pathfinder's more simulationist approach at all. Once I got passed that hurdle, lets call it abstraction block, I LOVED 4e. Are there things I would change? Sure. Hit Point bloat, interrupts, powers that key off the a grid, etc. But I really did come to love the game and I think that was from DMing it A LOT. At the time I had a steady group of players and their experience was mixed. Some never got passed the abstraction block, for some it didn't matter and just liked playing.  I don't believe any of them ever liked the game as much as I did/do, but none of them seemed to just HATE it with a passion that some seem to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group eventually broke up (players moved) and I've played 4e with several other groups since. Here was a mixed bag. If 4e has one big weakness, it's that it directs you towards combat. I'm not saying that is all there is to the game, just that it is designed to do combat on a grid well. A new, weak, lazy DM will tend to just go that route and then the game can drag and become boring. In that incarnation, yeah you are better off playing it as a 2 hour miniature wargame.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I'm running Castles &amp; Crusades (because I wanted to dip into that "old school" goodness pool) and playing some Dragon Age.  But I miss 4e and hope that 5e keeps the 4e flame alive while getting rid of its warts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374290/#Comment_374290" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T04:09:50+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  4:09AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see... First XP with 4e was shortly after it came out. I DM'd for my group, which was well versed in 3.5 and had taken stone forays into 2e. I went with Planescape, which is my favorite setting, and they started out in Sigil. We ended up getting really bogged down by the tactical combat, and we only ended up playing two sessions. After that, I participated in a D&amp;D event art a local game store, and I had more fun as a player (I was a monk, and damned if flipping around the battlefield making five attacks in one turn wasn't fun!), but it still felt like a series of minis skirmishes with a vague ongoing backstory. When the Castle Ravenloft board game came out, my GF bought it for me as a birthday present, and now the 4e board games are by far the best thing to come out of that system in my opinion. All of the fun bits of 4e are in there, without the pretense (and pressure) of having it be anything more than three board game it already felt like I had been playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374329/#Comment_374329" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T11:01:35+00:00" title="April 25, 2012 11:01AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4E is the pinnacle of D&amp;D game design. It took D&amp;D into the 21st century, much in the same way that 3E took D&amp;D into the 90's.  In that regards, 4E was much more forward than 3E.<br/><br/>I loved it and couldn't get enough. I was playing in two campaigns and running one, even though they were pretty sporadic (once every month or two) it was the most gaming I'd done in a while, and it's still the most gaming I've done since.  It's fantastically flexible, both in terms of how you can set up your own world, and how and which rules you might use (e.g. more skill tests vs combats or whatever). The rules are very distinct, allowing you to build fiction flavor into all kinds of categories. For example, you could decide there are no Paladins, which is nothing new, or you could remove all Divine classes, which is something that would have been difficult and potentially unbalancing in older editions.<br/><br/>But the downsides started to wear on me. First, a lot of the flexibility that is there outside of combat, such as the variety available with skill tests, is pretty flat and doesn't easily provide the players with interesting choices.  There's few levers for players outside of deciding to roll or not. I constantly wanted to hack in some kind of Aspect system, but when I tried it just felt tacked on and didn't really seem to do the trick. There is a ton of narrative power given to the DM, but that power doesn't extend to the players except by the DM granting it, and even then it's lackluster compared to other story focused games.<br/><br/>The combat is fantastic, and it's what I love most about it. But it got to be a paint to prepare for. Some of this work was my own, making tokens for the maps and all of that. But there was also the work of finding and selecting monsters, and printing out their stat blocks (which despite all of the online materials, this was a pain and inconsistent in quality - no thanks to WotC for not having PDFs available). It would be a few hours of preparation.  And combats themselves were a separate game. There was no storytelling happening, except for the specific encounter itself designed by the DM (which is hardly an efficient use of the 45-90 minutes a combat would take). It was like we'd stop playing our roleplaying game to play a board game based on our game for a bit, and then pick up the story after that.  Fun, but jarring and a lot of the time it seemed like most players at the table liked one part much more than another, and usually that part was "not combat."<br/><br/>In the end, I stopped playing in all the games I was in, and even though I wanted to start up new ones, I didn't want to face all those downsides. It was too much effort to make 4E into a roleplaying game so I could enjoy the board game, when I could have just played a roleplaying game.  Still, 4E was the most roleplaying game out of any edition of D&amp;D. It was just still too far behind where my interests are in game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>OK, What was D&amp;D 4E _TO YOU_?

Exploration wasn't an important thing in the rules, but it turns out it was a big deal to me. It also irked me that I dropped money on the pretty books only to learn 3 weeks later that a new edition was on the way. <br/><br/>That being said, I'm running a game for some coworkers. We've had some good fun with it, but I will likely abandon 4e after this run. I'm finding that for new players, the amount of information is so large, they can't efficiently calculate moves when it's "their turn." I more often then not feel as if everything else that goes on in 4e outside of "their turn" is exhausting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374960/#Comment_374960" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-29T15:16:10+00:00" title="April 29, 2012  3:16PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tried playing and running it a few times.
