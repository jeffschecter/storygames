Woo Hooo! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>As expected the first Chapter burns veeery slowly, but inevitably gravitates towards the eventual passage to the next Chapter. And after that the horror slowly but surely progresses faster. Will need to see how the next sessions go.<br/>Coming from FateLess I felt the absence of structures to help generate random fictional elements (Damn, Quoth, Compel) but this led to much more cooperation among the players, and some very purposeful and deliberate pieces of fiction... not a bad tradeoff.<br/>There are many interlocking rules that regulate what can be described in the game, and how it can be described, but just by printing them all on a cheat-sheet they came very easily and naturally.<br/>All in all I'm very pleased by this first test as I expected a total failure :P )<br/><br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>So the players were me and Daniel.<br/>I briefly introduced the game as \u201cLovecraftian Horror\u201d, to which Daniel said he had no idea of what it meant, as he never read Lovecraft. So I read him the introduction text from the rulebook:\n<blockquote>In this game you and your friends play the part of characters in a \u201cLovecraftian\u201d horror story: normal and rational people, in a normal and rational world, that slowly starts feeling increasingly wrong and unsafe and disturbing, in a crescendo that will lead to an horrific epilogue. This kind of horror focuses less on gore and violence, and more on creepiness and cosmic dread.</blockquote>\nFirst we chose a setting.<br/>He said Indonesia, but a big westernized city, in contemporary times.<br/>I said "whatever" and googled up Jakarta, to give a name to the city.<br/>We also agreed that both our characters would live in or around Jakarta.<br/>We then created our <b>Touched Ones</b> (the protagonist characters).<br/><br/>I played <b>Malcom DeVitt</b> (30-ish years old, British)<br/><i>Occupation:</i> Hotel Park Driver<br/><i>Loved Ones:</i><br/>Wangi Clun, my girlfriend<br/>Budi Atara, my best friend<br/>Tomas DeVitt, my father (still in England)<br/><br/>Daniel played <b>Muco Venator</b> (19-ish years old, Indonesian)<br/><i>Occupation:</i> Student of History, 1st Year of University<br/><i>Loved Ones:</i><br/>Eko Venator, my mother<br/>Darma Venator, my father<br/>Tri Venator, my brother (younger, still in high school)<br/><br/>We then brainstormed about the <b>Catalyst Even</b> and ended up with this:<br/>Muco\u2019s grandfather <b>Agung</b> just passed away and she was asked by her family to attend the funeral and help them sort his belongings.<br/>Malcom\u2019s girlfriend was employed by Muco\u2019s family as Agung\u2019s nurse; she needs to help them sort out the medical equipment and has asked Malcom to help her with the heavier stuff.<br/><br/>Then we set up the map, using the <b>Sidus path</b> (the Lovecraftian one, the other being the Umbra path, tailored for a more Clive Barker-esque style).<br/>We positioned the <b>story token</b> in Chapter one \u201c<i>Illusion</i>\u201d on the only available Station \u201c<i>Malkuth</i>\u201d.<br/>This meant that the <b>Shadows</b> in this chapter had to be inspired by this:<br/>- "<i>something is <b>off</b>, out of place or \u201cwrong\u201d in an undefinable way</i>".<br/>We then started playing Moments in turn.<br/><br/>Most moments were very brief, just enough to describe the scene and have the TOs perform one action or establish some detail, and then they ended, because it was obvious that they had exhausted their purpose and we wanted to move along, or where functionally cut but the rules after a change of location, time or spotlight.<br/><br/>The ensuing fiction was...<br/>(shadows are <b>bold</b>)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447713/#Comment_447713" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T15:38:27+00:00" title="August  7, 2015  3:38PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>1)<br/>Muco is on a train to Jakarta and, when it stops at an intervening station, she notices an <b>old creepy guy</b> standing out in the crowd. He has westerner traits, grey short hair and a very formal but modern business dress. He is creepy because among a moving crows he looks like the only immobile element, and has a weird blank expression, and seems to be looking straight at her... but it is only a glimpse... as soon as she tries to focus on the guy, he is gone, disappeared in the moving crowd.<br/><br/>2)<br/>Malcom is home with Wangi, cooking dinner and chatting about the day\u2019s events. She asks for his help with Agungs stuff and, among other things, she mentions noticing a <b>young creepy guy</b> (the description matches the other creepy guy, same clothes, same blank expression, but this one is younger and has long brown hair) while she was getting back home from work.<br/><br/>3)<br/>In the apartment she shares with other students, Muco shares her tragedy with her flatmates. The conversation ends when her friend mentions that someone (the <b>Old Creepy Guy</b>) came by earlier looking for her ... but dismisses it as just a coincidence: \u201c<i>There must be some religious group in town, like Jeovah Witnesses or something, all dressed alike</i>\u201d.<br/><br/>4)<br/>Malcom is at work in the subterranean garage of a luxury hotel. He just parked a car and has the disturbing <b>feeling of being watched</b>, but no one is around. While heading for the elevator he spots something out of place, <b>a red woman shoe</b> left in a corner.<br/><br/>5)<br/>Muco is in the subway, heading to her parent\u2019s house. She has a big bag with her laptop and other personal effects and clothes, all she need to spend a few days out of her apartment. In a reverie she remembers an old news article that creeped her out, about a woman assaulted in the middle of Jakarta, in daylight, with a crowd of people just standing around, watching without intervening. (<b>people standing by while violence is happening</b>)<br/>Then her station comes up and she disembarks, but someone pushes her from behind and tries to steal her bag. She tries to fight back (PvE conflict) but the criminal is too strong and manages to snatch the bag and run away.<br/>She lays on the subway pavement for a moment, unharmed but shocked, with people watching her... no one made a move to help her.<br/><br/>6)<br/>Malcom mentions the <b>red shoe</b> to a colleague, which in turn mentions having seen a similar shoe in the trunk of the car of a hotel guest. This sparks the idea to identify the guest (if he is still in the hotel) and return the shoe... there might be a reward or tip for this, and anyway it is a way to fight the boredom. With this in mind, Malcom heads back to the underground garage.<br/><br/>7)<br/>Muco looks for a cop, asking for help, and is gently directed towards the nearest police station to file a report. In so doing she glances the <b>old creepy guy</b>, and starts walking faster. She ends up in a desolated back street, runs through it and only at the end, one step from the safety of crowds, she looks back.<br/>A guy is standing at the back street entrance, unmoving, but is too far away to see clearly, maybe he\u2019s the old creepy guy, maybe not. Muco doesn\u2019t wait to find out and runs the rest of the way to the police station.<br/><br/>8)<br/>Malcom is in the garage. He goes to the corner where he found the <b>red shoe</b>... and it is not there. It lays instead in another corner. This <i>feels very wrong</i>, as he could have sworn he perfectly remembered where the shoe was. So he walks up to it and picks it up and in that exact moment the <b>tangible feeling of being watched</b> comes back. He looks around, also checking between the parked cars, but he is completely alone. Creeped out he steps in the elevator.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447714/#Comment_447714" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T15:38:36+00:00" title="August  7, 2015  3:38PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>9)<br/>At the police station Muco files the report and, while enumerating the personal effects contained in the bag, mentions a particular necklace with a <b>small metal pendant shaped like a black half moon</b>. In so doing she remembers when her grandfather gave it to her, for her graduation to university... and his words, which in the commotion of the moment, so full of friends and parents all congratulating her, she did not pay attention to, now sound kind of weird: \u201c<i>keep this as a memento of who you really are and where you truly belong</i>\u201d<br/><br/>10)<br/>Malcom is in front of a door, one of the guest rooms in the luxury hotel where he works. Apparently the man who drove the car with <b>the red shoe</b> in it, some Mr Kovalsky, is still checked in. The person opening the door is the <b>Young Creepy Guy</b> that, with cold but tactful manners, accepts the shoe, mentioning that it belongs to his wife, and rushedly closes the door. Walking away Malcom thinks back at what the concierge told him about the guest being here alone, not with a woman ... but he shrugs it off as the usual hotel \u201c<i>private affairs</i>\u201d that most guest use hotels for.<br/><br/>11)<br/>Muco is finally home and is warmly surrounded by her family. After spending a bit of time with them and clearing up the schedule for the next days, she mentions the lost <b>necklace</b>... but no one seems to remember it clearly, and no one can make sense of her grandfather\u2019s words, but then again he was an eccentric man with a lot of culture, maybe it was just a poetic quite from a favourite book of some sort.<br/><br/>12)<br/>Malcom is helping Wangi to sort the medical equipment from the deceased guy apartment. He toils to move the special orthopedic bed outside and load it on a van. When done he takes a moment to rest, and realizes how \u201coff\u201d this <b>old building</b> looks. There is nothing wrong or weird about it, but a collection of small peripheral details kind of sets it apart from the surrounding buildings in the neighbour, as if it had a sort of \u201cwild\u201d feeling about it: more weeds sprouting from the cracks, a somewhat old fashioned architecture, some windows shut by wooden planks here and there...<br/><br/>13)<br/>Muco was half helping her family sort through her grandfather\u2019s stuff and half looking for clues about her lost (and now mysterious) <b>neclace</b> when, alone in the personal study, she glanced on a book that caught her attention. A <b>big sturdy leather bound book</b> with a black half moon on its spine... and closed by leather straps and a lock, like a diary. Looking for a key to open it she also stumbled on <b>an old picture</b> (black and white and heavily yellowed by time) of a much younger Agung and another young guy; the man was giving the book to his grandfather and smiling to the camera, all place in front of some kind of hotel. It looked like a memento of an official event. On the back of the picture there were the words \u201c<i>welcome home, brother</i>\u201d.<br/>She stashes the book in a backpack and the picture in a pocket.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The <b>KEY</b> to end the first chapter (Illusion) and step into the second chapter (Rumors) is: the chapter ends when you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">realise</span> that something weird is going on and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">decide to act</span> on it.<br/>We immediately agreed that Muco's actions in this Moment turned the Key, so we moved the story token and, with a random roll, ended up in the \u201cYesod\u201d Station.<br/>This meant that the <b>Shadows</b> in this chapter had to be inspired by this:<br/>- "<i>something is <b>off</b>, out of place or \u201cwrong\u201d in an undefinable way</i>"<br/>- "<i>prevarication, brutality, the use of <b>force</b></i>"<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>14)<br/>Back in the apartment Malcom was helping move and pack things, half listening to the TV, when a piece of news caught his attention. It was the <b>news of a recent death</b>, a woman trampled by an unidentified vehicle. Among the other images there was one showing the woman\u2019s body... a blanket covered it completely while policemen were working all around it, but one detail was visible: the woman\u2019s feet were visible, and the right one was wearing <b>a red shoe</b> that looked exactly the same as the one he found in the garage... and he found a left shoe... Malcom felt a shiver down his spine, but forced himself to dismiss the fact as just a coincidence, albeit a disturbing one.<br/><br/>15)<br/>Armed with the <b>old picture</b> Muco went to her mother asking for info about it. But Eko was not very helpful, she did not recognize the location of the picture, or the occasion, or the book. The man with her father had a familiar look, but she could not put a name on him, he must have been an old family friend that visited them when she was still very little.<br/>And has for his father, no, he had no relatives, no brothers or sisters, and as far as she knew he was not part of any group or circle, and she would have known such a thing!<br/><br/>(the <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Menace</span></i></b> die was rolled for the first time and scored a 1, moving it forward by one step, from its starting position \u201cout of the map\u201d and into the first Chapter)<br/><br/>16)<br/>Malcom was trying to shrug off the bad feeling he got from the <b>TV report</b>, when the young Muco came in the room to ask Wangi if she recognized the other man in <b>the picture</b>, maybe someone that visited his grandfather?<br/>Taking a look at the picture himself, Malcom recognized the place, an old and famous hotel in the city of Cilegon where vips and actors from times past used to reside and organize exclusive parties.<br/>But he also notices the young man... sure it has different clothes and is smiling, and it could not possibly be the same person because the picture is so old... but he looks just like the<b> Young Creepy Guy </b>in his hotel, Mr Kovalsky... is he maybe a relative? or one of the twins that urban legends say everyone has?<br/>After a short discussion (PvP conflict, Muco got +1 Unease) Muco convinces Malcom to help her meet the guy.<br/><br/>(the <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Menace</b></span></i> die was rolled and scored again a 1, moving it forward by one step, from the first Chapter to the second Chapter, right were the Touched Ones are... triggering a <b>Dark Moment</b>. The die says that I am to play the <b>Victim</b>, and that it will specifically be my loved one Budi)<br/><br/>17)<br/>Budi, Malcom\u2019s best friend, was walking back home from work.<br/>The night was illuminated by street lamps, except one dark patch just ahead, where yellow police tape also blocked the passage. He had not realized that <b>the accident where the woman had died</b> in the past days had happened here. Morbid curiosity made him walk into the poorly litten zone and observe the scene, the dark stains on the ground, the crooked and broken street lamp. With a shiver he realized that <b>someone was watching him</b>, but when he turned around there was no one, so he just shrugged the feeling off and went home.<br/>There, alone, he was unable to shake off <b>the bad feeling</b>, so he started watching a movie on his PC... when someone gave <b>three strong knocks</b> at the door. Budi killed the movie\u2019s audio and waited, still and quiet... and three more knocks hit the door with even greater strength. For some reason he was unable to move, terrified.<br/>Who might be? And why knock if there is a perfectly fine doorbell? And he had seen too many horror movies to even think of going near the door to look through the peephole.<br/>Three more knocks hit the door with such <b>force</b> that a small frame with a funny holiday picture fell from the wall near the entrance, making Budi jump on his chair.<br/>Black Screen.<br/>The Dark Moment ends on a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>As a result of the Dark Moment I added one mark near Budi\u2019s name, meaning that from now on when he is present in a Moment he will start out appearing <i>Despondent</i> in some way.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>After that we wrapped up the session, that had lasted 3h in total.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447721/#Comment_447721" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-07T17:07:57+00:00" title="August  7, 2015  5:07PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!<br/><br/>How are the Moments handled?
