You don't have the visual actions of the players or that personal proximity that they have. So you're probably getting something that's 30%-40% as engaging, at most (no hard numbers, just my guess), as an in-play session.<br/><br/>You have to gear a recording specifically towards being a recording in order to get a lot of mileage out of it, and not just pop a recorder into the middle of a session.</blockquote>\nI agree. It's very difficult to convey the role playing experience to outsiders. Do you guys have any examples of Actual Plays or other presentations of RPGs in recorded media which really nailed it? I'm aware of Wil Wheaton's Fiasco playthrough on YouTube. Any other good examples?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409903/#Comment_409903" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T08:21:43+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  8:21AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AP recordings of Skype games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409915/#Comment_409915" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T09:11:36+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  9:11AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The other point I made after the fact was to add that equally important is presenting the mechanics of the game in a visual manner, instead of just audibly recapping them. The TableTop replays actually do a good job of this as well. In fact, I <b>still</b> found the Dragon Age playthrough to be really engaging, despite the fact that the game session depicted was not terribly interesting.<br/><br/>One thing which makes it a lot easier to connect is their technique of cutting away to give subtext from the players afterwards. Like, when they cut back and Wil talks for a bit about his character, his at-that-time reaction to the situation that wasn't stated out loud. I think that a visual medium is the type with the biggest opportunity to convey a fuller experience.<br/><br/>I haven't watched them yet, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/commiesutra/videos?view=0&amp;flow=grid" rel="nofollow">Quinn Murphy put up a bunch of Marvel Heroic AP vids</a> from his Hangout sessions.

It requires a lot more effort on the part of the listener and strikes me as being unnecessarily hard. Then again, I don't personally find there to be much social pressure when playing face-to-face, but I can see how other people would feel it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409955/#Comment_409955" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T12:20:05+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 12:20PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Slightly off topic, but I'm very interested in doing printed, attractive replays for games, but am not sure how to make it happen (getting people to play a variety of games, recording devices, printers, etc...).

For a small selection of games, I getting a group together, playing the game, recording it, transcribing it, adding commentary as to the thought process behind what players are doing. Then I'll be giving it away as an ebook and pdf.<br/><br/>Right at the moment, 3 games (of 6) are played, 1 more is scheduled and 2 more I'm trying to schedule. One (Love in the Time of Sei\xf0) is fully transcribed with _some_ commentary (though it needs some more). At present it's just held on a wiki so that the players can edit it, but ultimately I will lift it into a book format with proper footnotes (and maybe some images for the pdf as I really liked the look of Ewen's GSS replay). <br/><br/>Anyway, if you want to see what a fully transcribed game looks like, you can find it here (still in its wiki form):<br/><a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/wiki/Seid_2013_Jan_09" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukroleplayers.com/wiki/Seid_2013_Jan_09</a><br/><br/>Have a read and see if you still find the concept interesting. Feel free to feedback regarding the content, the level of commentary (too much/too little), any moments that you'd like commented upon, whether or not reading someone else's game turns your brain to porridge or is really rather interesting etc. etc. Layout and visuals will change so don't worry about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410057/#Comment_410057" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T05:52:48+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  5:52AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2013 5:57AM by Nathan_H.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make it a story about a story, and you have win.  <br/>If it's just people talking all role-play-y, I tune the fuck out.  <br/>Like, if it actually tells you a bit about the people making funny voices, that's way better then people making funny voices.  <br/>People are interesting.
