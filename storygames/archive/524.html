                    OK, so this is split off from <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=479&amp;page=2#Item_84" rel="nofollow"><b>"Playing Across Gender Lines"</b></a>.  I'd like to separate it from the "Playing Across Gender Lines" because, well, you don't have to have any cross-gender play for this to be important.  <br/><br/><b>kleenestar</b> wrote:
<blockquote>Everyone: how do you find that creating characters with dysfunctional sexual natures or histories of sexual abuse relates to the sex/gender of the characters you create? How does it come up in play? Do you only see abused characters in play, or do people ever play sexual abusers? And how do you deal with the out-of-game issues that it might raise for players with histories of sexual abuse of their own?</blockquote>
An intriguing topic, and I think an important one.  <br/><br/>Histories of sexual abuse are rare for my characters.  I think the only clear case was male -- Inferno was born a street urchin in Victorian London, and abused before he became a vampire.  It didn't really come out in play except in his rages.  There are a few characters who were perhaps similar but not strictly abusive.  My original vision for Idelle (an apprentice in an Ars Magica campaign) was that she had been having sex with her master in a clearly unequal relationship, but the GM wasn't comfortable with that so it was axed.  Baraud (an Agrikan priest in HarnMaster) had had a relationship with an older woman who engaged in sado-masochistic behavior (which is quite different from abuse but can edge into it).  <br/><br/>An interesting case is my current PC, Dot.  So I decided during the first season that she had been a teenage mother and put her child for adoption a few years prior to the campaign.  (Again, not abuse, but a traumatic experience.)  However, I also decided <i>not</i> to tell the GM about it.  Basically, I wanted this as a bit of backstory and motivation; and I was afraid that bringing it up would encourage melodramatic and/or cliched use of it.  It eventually came out at the end of the season, and it was highlighted when she got pregnant during Season Two.  <br/><br/>I think the sexes of the PCs are important, in particular how I react to stereotypes.  I like to have characters who touch on stereotypes, but say interesting things about them.  <br/><br/>I've had two characters who were borderline abusive -- both male.  One was a self-hating assassin (Cain) and one was an abusive policeman (Grimmond).  There wasn't any sexual abuse during play (though there were violent acts).  I was disturbed by Cain, primarily because the other players didn't take his violence seriously.  In particular, at one point he kidnapped a woman doctor to help with his sisters -- stalking her, then holding her at gunpoint while telling her they were "going out on a date".  On the flip side, Grimmond was nastier than Cain, but the GM and other players also reacted to him as nasty.  Mostly, it was clear that he would hit anyone including women that he was involved with, but that never came up in play.  <br/><br/>I only know one case where I know history of sexual abuse of a fellow players -- that's my wife.  However, I realize that people whom I play with may well have histories of sexual abuse that I don't know about.  So I do tread carefully.  Hence abuse has never directly come up in-game.  But it's certainly an issue I've considered and indirectly looked at.                </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>To bring my stuff from the other thread, here are the most relevant bits: <br/><br/>While answering a question about how I relate to my female PCs, their sexuality, and the sexuality of women in my real life, one of the things I said was this: <code>Now days I still play sexualized women from time to time, but I try to do it without either fetishizing or debasing their sexuality or simplifying their issues. I probably have less experience with this than others, as I've been doing way more GMing than playing for the last 5 years, and so my total number of PCs is low Ã¢â‚¬â€œ meaning I haven't had a huge chance to play this type of character. I did one who was a seductress type, a femme fatal, who was a mixture of Madonna and whore herself, who ended up (against my expectations) having a history of sexual abuse that caused a lot of her trauma. She started out as a character I may have wanted to have a torrid fantasy affair with, and ended up as a character whom I wanted to hold while she cried. That was alsoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ umÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ like a year ago. </code><br/>About which I got asked this by kleenestar Jessica:<code>Brand, how did you realize that your seductress character had been sexually abused? How did you deal with it, as her player, when you realized it? Do you feel like that decision had anything to do with her assumption of sexual power and seduction? </code><br/>To which I responded with this:<code>The dynamic of that character was quite interesting, but not fully under my control. I didn't create the character, I just played her. And I didn't instigate the child abuse, someone else suggested it. We were playing the Pool, they did an idea roll about something like her having a "funny uncle" and I ran with it. <br/><br/>The thing about it was that despite that there was, no doubt, a tie between this characters specific sexuality and the abuse that built up quite quickly in my mind due to relationships I've had with abused children and women who were abused as children. She had an agressive, predatory sexuality that early on spoke to me of someone who could have esteme in herself only when she was being lusted after by someone else. At first this was sort of just playing to type, but as the game went on it got deeper and deeper. <br/><br/>It was a bit of a difficult issue for me -- but it was worse for one of the other players. He was a guy who would pick up at clubs, and apaprently he saw a lot of his former one-night stands in my character. To be confronted with the idea that some of the women he was with may have been doing what they did because they were subconciously repeating an abusive pattern that started when they were a child was horrifying to him. For that matter, it was horrifying to me. The male fantasy of the sexual woman who wants you and comes after you so that all you have to do is sit there and let her seduce you was suddenly turned into the realization that everyone has reasons for what they do -- and for some those reasons are not healthy. Some of our fantasy women are abuse victims. And what does that make us? <br/><br/>OTOH, one of the girls in the game afterwards told me she was really weirded by the whole thing. She saw what I was doing and approved, but was odded out by the fact that it was a man doing it. She said it felt too much like me judging female sexuality and finding it sick at the core. We didn't get to talk about it much, but one thing she did volunteer (I didn't ask) was that if the character were played exactly the same way by a female player, she didn't think she would have the same reaction. <br/><br/>For the next question: I've never played a PC sexual abuser -- that one is way too much a hot button for me. I have played PCs that were abused both in backstory and in the course of the game, both male and female PCs. <br/><br/>As for dealing with players who have been abused: that's why I usually set up some expectations about the game before play -- including some kind of safeword for those who need something to stop right there so we can talk about it.</code>Then this in response to a question from Thomas about what role/rights boys had in playing female characters who have been abused or raped:<code>Thomas: Girls beat me to it. For me in my thing with the abused girl cum femme fatal, it made me realize how often my fantasies of sexy womenz were... well, objective and voiceless. There was a whole part of my life in which I never, in my dirty back brain, stopped to wonder why the sexy video girl was hitting on me so hard... so realizing that the pattern of behavior I was fantasizing about was consistant with abuse victims was like getting punched in the nuts. <br/><br/>As a note, no, I don't think all women who are active, agressive, or whatever in their sexuality are unhealthy or abused. I'm saying that the issue was that before that revelation I -hadn't cared enough what they were other than sexy-. Now I still like the sexy womenz, but I want to know them, not just see them. <br/><br/>(Of course, that's also due to things like growing up and getting married, not just due to the game. But the game did a good job of shoving it up my nose until I had to realize that I had changed and accept that in myself.)</code>And then ended by asking this question to everyone after some talk about what we learn by playing such characters:<code>That's an interesting observation. It's one I've thought about too. Much as I'm now talking about some cross gender play that has changed me, I have to say there are equal (greater?) amounts that haven't. <br/><br/>What do you think the difference is? Is it a timing issue? A matter of the things you face in game? How strong of a pre-judgement you go into the game with?</code><br/><br/>And I think with that all my abuse stuff from that thread is now over here.                        </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>Now, I have some questions to ask, if you don't mind being questioned. <br/><br/>You said: <code>My original vision for Idelle (an apprentice in an Ars Magica campaign) was that she had been having sex with her master in a clearly unequal relationship, but the GM wasn't comfortable with that so it was axed. Baraud (an Agrikan priest in HarnMaster) had had a relationship with an older woman who engaged in sado-masochistic behavior (which is quite different from abuse but can edge into it).</code>What put the GM off? The whole issue of sex? The unequal power of it? Can you tell me anything about what you were wanting to do with that angel? Where you saw it going in play? <br/><br/>Also, did you get to play Baraud? How much of that came out in game? <br/><br/>I ask because there is this issue with abused characters that has traditionally been difficult for me. See, when I play a character with an abused or difficult backstory, I don't want the story to come gushing out ICly -- but I want the others at the table to know about it. I had some big problems back in the day with people who used their abused characters as spotlight hoggers and trump carders -- every scene became "I was abused so I win the argument!" Which isn't accurate to many abuse victims I've known, and certainly isn't what I wanted dramatically speaking. <br/><br/>Now days with the whole authoring game things I've picked up from the Forge and such games, I can more easily deal with that, as not all information has to be given to character from character. Setting up player knowledge so that they can watch as an audience as my character either fails or triumphs is very rewarding. But, while I have some starter level skill in it, I'm always looking for more good methods to do this without looking like a dork about it.                        </div>

                            Responding to part of the kleenstar quote that spawned this thread:<br/>
<br/>
bq. Do you only see abused characters in play, or do people ever play sexual abusers?<br/>
<br/>
Oddly I've felt more comfortable playing the abusive characters more than the abused.  Both characters that I can think of were written to be at least heartless and at most actually evil, and what abuse occured was well off-screen.  <br/>
<br/>
The first that comes to mind was the demon Christian, in _In Nomine,_ whose _mode de guerre_ involved casually breaking the spirits of anonymous raver kids.  Again, this functioned as a backdrop and characterization for what was intended to be a really unlikeably evil character.  <br/>
<br/>
More recently, in an online game of TSoY, I was playing Lucretta, the elven house mistress to a debauched lord, and the story revolved around the cruel and bizarre way that his servant girl was to be deflowered.  Lucretta was blythely complicit in plans that IIRC never came to fruition.  But something about the degree of premeditation, and the fact that my character was actively advancing a really despicable scheme -- by no means was she hiding behind "just following orders" -- made this the more disturbing situation to play out.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of these characters were written with "sexual abuser" in their premise.  But when the character could go that way, I took them there.  I feel like it was easier for me to play that out than to play the victim of abuse.  Because it was easier to play that out in a useful, interesting, authentic way, than it would have been to play a victim.                        </div>

Well, Idelle was a character in an Ars Magica campaign set in an alternate timeline in 767 A.D., where the PCs were apprentices of the founder of the Order of Hermes, Bonisagus.  However, he was killed and their covenant destroyed at the start of the campaign.  Idelle was a self-conscious effort at an over-the-top passive-aggressive woman at home in medieval society.  She was powerful, but deceived others and to a large degree herself regarding her power.  I have Idelle's <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/arsmagica/old_chars/idelle.html" rel="nofollow"><b>original character sheet</b></a> online.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly what Joe's issue was.  Interestingly, after I suggested this, he did write in that the eldest and more powerful apprentice, Trianoma, was Bonisagus' wife.  Ostensibly he didn't think it fit with Bonisagus' character, but I'm sure there was more behind that.  <br/><br/>As to how Idelle worked out, I was frustrated.  She desperately wanted a husband (or even just a lover) and a family, but none of the other PCs had any interest in her, and there weren't any suitable NPCs.  We talked about it some, but eventually dropped it.  
<blockquote>Also, did you get to play Baraud? How much of that came out in game?</blockquote>
Yes, I played Baraud for a bit.  It came out particularly in his interactions with the 15-year-old half-sister of his lord, Lady Vilna.  She began to flirt with him as he became something of a hero for defeating a Morgathian cult in the village, and also showed an interest in watching his torture of the prisoners.  He wanted to convert her into the religious order that he was in, and channel her sexual excitement into it.  However, it only went a little way.  He let her in on the torture, giving her instruction on it, and also dropped in on her once or twice, but the PCs ended up leaving the village on a mission, and the campaign ended before they returned.                        </div>

                            Right, to answer a question Brand brought up in the gender thread about a character I played.  Here's what I originally said about her:<br/>
<br/>
On the sexual abuse level, I once played a character who used to be a prostitute because she had no other way to earn money and then turned to thievery. I played her with no emotions that attached her to other people: no love, no hate, no remorse, no friendship. She shut everyone out. She would work with you, save your life, even, but she didn't care about anyone else, not even family. She was even sleeping with one of the other characters because there was no reason not to and it helped to have someone to watch her back, even if she didn't trust him. She was really really awesome to play and one of my all-time favourite characters.<br/>
<br/>
And Brand wanted more detail about how I expressed her emotionless nature and non-attachment.  Well, she *was* a thief and made off with pretty much all of the party's money at the end of the game.  But while actually playing I expressed indifference a lot using one-shouldered shrugs, slouching posture, and questions like "why are we doing this?"  I also didn't get her involved in coversations a lot, not contributing to the group.  To say she would save your life in any situation is taking it a bit far since she would really only save your life if it was worth her effort and you would be useful later.  She also attacked several party members.  She went off on exploits of her own.  When they went into the thieves' underground city, she didn't bother to relay any of her knowledge about them to the party.  She was sleeping with another party member -- an ex-pirate -- and she slept with a knife or two under her pillow and he with a pistol under his and they both checked all their belongings every morning to make sure the other person hadn't stolen anything.  She didn't trust anything to any other person.  She was followed one day by the same party member before they started sleeping together and she caught him and said "fine, you can come shopping with me." and then made him carry everything.  She never smiled.  She only wore a dress when there was absolutely nothing else to wear.  She never had less than 30 knives on her person at once.  She used to dress in brown leather, but after getting to the city switched it to all-black.  She always kept her hair pulled back in a tight ponytail.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, she made people want to avoid her, as well as not caring.  Is that more what you were looking for, Brand?<br/>
<br/>

                            Judson, <br/><br/>Yea, I can see that. I also have to say that as a GM I actually realized I do play an abuser... like all the freaking time. I haven't done abuser PCs, but I've done abuser NPCs that were both disturbing and (more disturbing) fun to play. <br/><br/>So, you speak of taking the character there -- how much premeditation did you use? Was it your idea, or a collaberative thing from the group? How did the others respond to it? Support/oppose your story? <br/><br/>Also, can you think of situations or support that would let you play the abused? Or is it something you just don't have interest in doing? <br/><br/>John, <br/><br/>That's very clear, thanks! I have questions for you forming, but they're coming slowly, so I'll post em soon. <br/><br/>Nancy, <br/><br/>Yes it is, thanks! As with John, I can feel questions at the back of my mind, but its late and they're forming slowly.                        </div>

                            Mo, <br/><br/>Oh yea. True that. Like Jerzom. <br/><br/>See, we played this game, Mo and I and two of our friends. I was the GM. The story got nasty. It's Exalted, and in Exalted I almost always play around a lot with past lives. <br/><br/>Well, as it happens there is a very bad man from Kika's (Mo's character) past life. In that life he had enslaved her, raped her, and murdered her. In the very end of the game she comes face to face with him again, to face off against her abuser. She put aside her weapons and her magic, and faced him with nothing but the voice of the girl he had tortured and destroyed in the first age. <br/><br/>And for it he killed her. He mutilated her body. He cut off her head and he spat in her dead face and roared his rage at her. But he couldn't leave her behind, because much as he could destroy her he could not move past her. And so she stopped him, and in the end overcame him as her soul went on and his fell heavy as a stone. <br/><br/>(More of the story is writen out <a href="http://www.spaceanddeath.com/sin_aesthetics/kika.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.) <br/><br/>So yea, that character was an abuser. And evil. And vile. And after I finished playing the scene for like five minutes afterwards I couldn't meet the eyes of anyone else in the group. But after the game was over, everyone told me that it made them feel they could trust me more as a GM, to do that and come back. Some personal demon died that night, I think.                        </div>

                            bq. So, you speak of taking the character there -- how much premeditation did you use? Was it your idea, or a collaborative thing from the group? How did the others respond to it? Support/oppose your story?<br/>
<br/>
_In Nomine_ was a large ensemble game, mixed angels and demons, and Christian was a very regular character.  He's still one of my favorite characters, and I always get a little wistful for the game.  His Demon Prince was devoted to human souls achieving their dark fates.  So, as part of the concept for Christian, I sketched out a role for him where he arranged big and dangerous raves for young teens.  During play it developed into casual sexual abuse as a further characterization.  New players came into the game all the time, and part of the challenge of that game was continually re-characterizing for new audiences.  An Christian was really fun to play - he was flambouyantly, twistedly evil, and there was a challenge to putting some flesh on that.<br/>
<br/>
Lucretta was an elf in _The Shadow of Yesterday,_ purely selfish, ignorant of love for another.  She was the house mistress in service to the an Ammani lord whose twisted understanding of goblins had led him to arrange a mock wedding, and especially the consumation, between his nubile servant girl and a slave goblin.  The goblin, Pendajo is one of the characters I've played alongside that I like best.  Lucretta's tasks involved managing the virgin, and making sure she was ready.  And in complete understanding of what was going to happen, and her role in it, she was going to do a good job for the pride of it.  The exact details of the game situation weren't available when I made the character - but as they came up I rose to the situation and charged ahead as an accomplice to forcible bestiality.<br/>
<br/>
Feedback from the group - with Christian I think I always played the line closely -- I wanted a reaction but I didn't want to push people out of the game.    And even the other demon players were a little uncomfortably.  Lucretta was a denizen of an online game, and I don't really remember getting much feedback - except in character from Pendejo.  There was a great great great exchange between a goblin and an elf about "what is love?"  <br/>
<br/>
Playing that kind of character is like throwing up tar.  You look at what came out of you and it looks horrible, but you feel good for having gotten it out of you.  For me though, I can really get into the evil of the characters, but I don't think I could manage it if I was victimizing another PC, or even a well drawn GMC.<br/>
<br/>
bq. Also, can you think of situations or support that would let you play the abused? Or is it something you just don't have interest in doing?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe?  If it happened the same way.  In other words, I wouldn't make a character whose central premise was "abused."  But if their premise drove them into that concept, I'd dive into that just as hard.                        </div>

Yes, I totally agree there.  I tend to have relatively mild content in my games -- to a fair degree deliberately.  So, I've never had "on-screen" sexual abuse.  If I did, I'm not sure I'd distinguish major/minor character.  So, a PC or major NPC has the problem of being much more detailed -- but allowing it to a minor character seems like trivializing it.  This was what disturbed me about Cain's kidnapping.  On some level, I'd prefer to make it more uncomfortable rather than be letting it happen but glossing it over.  <br/><br/>Does anyone else feel that way?                        </div>

                            I absolutely feel this way.  I've played abused characters and abusive characters, but I try not to play them lightly - whether they're a PC or an NPC.<br/><br/>As long as we're getting concrete, my current character is both abused and an abuser, but she would never, never think of herself that way.  (Nor do I think of her that way most of the time, for that matter!)  This is in a birth-to-death <i>Ars</i> game in which my character was stolen from her happy home by a Flambeau who wanted her as an apprentice.  He secured her "consent" by threatening to kill her family, then put her through the hell of Flambeau training.  While he didn't rape her, he beat her, starved her to the point of lifelong malnutrition side effects, humiliated her, threatened to kill her family if she disobeyed, etc.  The character spent a lot of time thinking about how to kill him, and then repenting a lot and confessing all her evil thoughts.  It was interesting and quite fun, actually, though it may be strange of me to admit it!<br/><br/>Part of what made that a little easier to deal with was that I was able to look at it in comparison to what the average apprenticeship of the time was like.  While it was certainly a lot worse, what happened to her wouldn't be thought of as 'abuse' in the same way that it might today.  It was also definitely easier because it wasn't sexual, and it wasn't a family member.  While Basilia grew to have complicated feelings about her pater (love, hate, respect, compassion, fury), it was much more straightforward than if sex or family relationships had been thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>Of course, this didn't stop her from perpetuating the cycle of violence.<br/><br/>About fifty years later, the character picked up an apprentice of her own.  Although her master died during her apprenticeship and she'd escaped to the Guernicus, her model of how to have an apprentice was very Flambeau.  So she basically sat down and said, "How can I torment this young boy for his own good, to put him through the pain that I went through and has made me the woman I am today?"  Then she broke both his arms.  Things went on from there . . . though admittedly, again, it was never sexual abuse, which I suppose made it easier for me to deal with.<br/><br/>Yes, that was a little bit uncomfortable for me, but also an incredibly interesting place to go with the character.  I'm able to recognize that what I'm identifying with about the character is not her abusiveness, but her feelings of suffering and her desire to do what's right, even if that's a little twisted because of her upbringing.<br/><br/>It's also been really interesting to play her growing and changing; it took her about ten years to win her first apprentice's loyalty and trust, and she realized that maybe that was because of how badly she hurt him.  She's trying to take a different tack with her second apprentice, which is not working so well yet.  She spends a lot of time worrying about whether she's making the girl weak of character or whatnot.<br/><br/>Her story's not done yet, so I'm curious to see how it will turn out!<br/><br/>But I guess what I've learned from this - and this is one of those things that I'm a little hesitant to admit, but it's true - is that I'm capable of really enjoying playing an abusive character or an abused character without feeling like I'm throwing up tar.  I really enjoy figuring out how she might act, and having her try to deal with the results of her actions, and trying to get inside the mindset of someone who would do terrible things out of love.  It's a story I'd be interested in exploring again; while I've had abusive/abused NPCs, I've never done it with a PC before, and I think there's a lot of richness there.<br/><br/>I think it makes a difference that I didn't set out to play a character who was either abused or abusive.  Both came out of choices that she made, and choices that other characters made, and the things that happened to her during play.  Dark as it may be, it all felt very natural.<br/><br/>I hope I haven't upset anyone; I'm just trying to tell a complicated truth.<br/><br/>I also hope it's okay to expand the topic to non-sexual abuse, too . . . .<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            A few thoughts: <br/><br/>Most of my characters who were abused (PCs) didn't start off as abused characters, or at least not overtly. My abusers (mostly NPCS) do, however, often start off as just that. Not that I think "I need an abuser now" but that I think "I need something horrid here" and in many cases the answer that will swim out of the deep recesess of the evil I have seen in mankind is something abusive. Not always sexually, but always emotionally. <br/><br/>I also find it interesting to hear about group reactions to things that develop in games. For exmpale, the feme fatal in my story didn't start abused, it happened in the game with a push from the other characters. But as I played through it the other players pulled back, and even thugh they never asked me to stop (or indicated otherwise that I should stop), it became clear that the ball they'd started rolling was much bigger than they'd intended. <br/><br/>John, <br/><br/>I'd rather have it be uncomfortable than have it be glossed over, certainly. Abuse gets glossed enough IRL, in game I'd like to have it uncomfortable and unignorable. However, I also don't want it to be absurd or grotesque. I don't like it when players or GMs use abuse as the "you must respond now in the way I want!" mode -- which I've seen all to often. I also don't want to revel in it -- and the line between pushing it far enough to be uncomfortable but not so far that it becomes... squick... is a thin one. <br/><br/>Judson, <br/><br/>Thanks for the answers! For the record, I find elves in TSOY to be much creepier than Demons in IN - and I would have loved to be a fly on the wall durring the elf/goblin conversation. <br/><br/>Jess, <br/><br/>As far as the puking up tar issue goes, do you think it has to do with the level on which you identify with the character? The ways in which you explore their issues? <br/><br/>After I played my femme fatal I had made my whole group back off with wide eyes, but I didn't get the tar-puke feeling. As I said, I wanted to hold her and let her know it was going to be all right. (I would be lying though, it wasn't going to be.) OTOH, after I played Jerzom in that final scene with Mo I felt like I'd puke up tar and then puked up blood too. It was disgusting and horrible, and there was a way in which it was "fun" by being cathartic, but it was something for which the word "enjoyable" would be a mighty strong term.                        </div>

                            I played a sociopath once. He was the really scary kind, smart and capable and helpful toward the other players' goals.<br/><br/>I did a "guest GMing" spot in that game where I basically ran the other PCs through a dream sequence of his. In the dream, I presented -- through Silent Hill-style horror metaphor -- the terrible childhood that had created him.<br/><br/>I introduced a prostitute NPC into the dream who the characters learned was my character's mother. They asked her to lead them to my character's dream-self. She demanded money. They gave it to her, not realizing it was more than a bribe.<br/><br/>When she led the PCs to the door of her apartment, where my character's young dream-self was hiding, she turned to them and started laying out the rules. "You'll find him in here. Don't cut him. Don't break any bones..."<br/><br/>I feel grim satisfaction at the memory of the players' faces when they realized people paid this woman every day to take them to her son. They realized that session just why my character had become a sociopath and a murderer.<br/><br/>Before running this session, I took extra precautions. I checked with every player regarding their comfort zone. One female player thought she would get uncomfortable, so she and I worked it out so she could step out of the room during one difficult sequence.<br/><br/>Me? I've got no sexual abuse history, nor do I know much about others'. But running this session and playing my sociopath PC was still cathartic. In many ways it was a metaphor for the geek abuse I'd suffered in elementary and middle school.                        </div>

                            Relativism is all well and good, Fred, and it certainly goes toward a basic principle of catharsis.  But though I don't think this was your intention, statements like that can appear to simplistically equate all trauma.<br/>

I was not raped as a child.  A friend of mine was.  It was worse for her to be a child than it was for me.                        </div>

                            Guys, <br><br>This is John's thread, so he can GodMod me as needed, but I'd like to request that we keep this discussion very firmly grounded in games and talk about those games and specific ways of deal with these issues in and through play. <br/><br/>I know that it is a much bigger issue than that: by fucking huge and far. However, I also think that if we don't keep it focused on game, gaming, and specific examples we're going to get out of scope and probably start having the kinds of discussions that kill productivity in threads. <br/><br/>So, Fred, how do you get at those points specifically in your games? Do you use abuse commonly? Not commonly? How many of your characters feature it as a prominant part of their personality? <br/><br/>Brendan, and I know this is a big one, so tell me to fuck the fucking hell off if you want to -- do you game with that friend? If/when you do, how would you feel about having any type of abuse as an element in the game? What would you do about it?                        </br></br></div>

                            One of the things that I ask myself when I make a character (not always, but often) is "What is the worst thing that ever happened to this character?"  As a general guideline, he won't react very badly to anything that happens, until one of two things happens:<br/>
<br/>
1&gt; Something that reminds him of that worst thing, in a PTSD kind of way<br/>
2&gt; Something that is worse than that worst thing, in a "fate worse than death" kind of way<br/>
<br/>
If I'm getting really detailed, I might choose a few different things from different times and situations.  "What's the worst thing that a girl ever said to him?  What's the worst thing his parents ever did to him?  What's the worst financial loss he's ever suffered?  What's the ugliest thing he's ever seen?  What's the most sacred vow he's ever broken?  What's the worst beating he's ever taken?"                        </div>

                            Brand, nice catch.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I gamed with that friend; she used to tease me about gaming in college, but thinking back on it now, I bet she would have enjoyed being invited.  As for bringing abuse into the game, my perspective would...  vary.<br/>
<br/>
As a trad, one-PC player, I wouldn't create a character with a history of abuse.  No fucking way.<br/>
<br/>
As a GM, or a player taking on GM duties (say, as New Moon in Polaris), I'd think hard about bringing abused or abusive NPCs into play.  If I felt it was important to do so, I wouldn't do it without talking to her first, without establishing her position on the Nobody Gets Hurt-I Will Not Abandon You spectrum.  If she said she was firmly in the latter camp--or if our previous games together established as much--I'd start with maybe one or two scenes in one game, and do a group decompression talk after we wrapped up.  Oh, and I wouldn't do it at all unless everybody at the table was aware of the context.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.  Now I'm wondering why I'd be okay with introducing abuse elements as a GM, but not a player.  The first thing that occurs to me is that the GM is generally expected to have a one-on-one relationship with each player, and to give them issues to confront, whereas players may well move in parallel tracks; if I created an abused PC, I'd feel I was co-opting her pain for game fodder, whereas a GM could better share the confrontation with her.<br/>
<br/>
If she were GMing and I were playing, and she introduced an abused NPC, I...  have no idea what I'd do.                        </div>

Imagine two people.<br>

The worst thing that ever happened to Sally, is that she was raped as a child.<br>
<br>
The worst thing that ever happened to Jake, is that he broke his leg the day before yesterday.<br>

Who is worse off?<br>
<br>
Sally has come to terms with her trauma, healed as much as she is able, and is a functional and rational human being.<br/>
<br/>
Jake whines and bitches about how much pain he's in, about how he can't ride his motorcycle anymore, and worries that since he doesn't have medical insurance or sick time, he's going to get fired and evicted from his apartment.<br/>
<br/>
Who is worse off?<br/>
<br/>
Happiness isn't something that you get from having good things happen to you, and suffering isn't something that comes from pain.<br/>
<br/>
I don't mean to minimize anyone's suffering, God knows... but it's completely impossible to compare pain from one person to another, and conclude from that how much suffering they're doing.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Where as its possible he's not doing that at all, and is just showing the way his character reacts to that specific pain. <br/><br/>How much of this do we need to communicate ICly? OOCly? How much social contract work do you think is needed before starting down such a road? <br/><br/>Brendan, <br/><br/>Good call on the GM thing. I have to say that even though I'm futzing about with GMless games these days, I still have some of those assumptions. Do you think that there is something in that GM-individual relationship, players-non-individual relationship model that makes it harder to do abuse stories well? I mean, would it be easier or harder to deal with it if every member of the group was fully responsible to every member of the group?                        </div>

                            Thanks, Brand, about the topic check.  It's inevitable that we're going to touch on abuse issues, but let's try to keep it connected to gaming.  Also, it's natural to relate in other kinds of abuse, but let's keep some focus on sexual abuse.  <br/><br/>Fred -- please take it somewhere else.  Obviously rating suffering is a personal issue, since there's no objective measurement.  Do you have any gaming experiences or thoughts to relate on the subject?  <br/><br/><b>Brand_Robins</b> wrote:

Brand, so naturally I have to ask you to tell me more about the problems with using abuse in that mode which you've often seen.  What do players or GMs do to say "You must respond now in the way I want!"?  I think I have similar experiences, in that I really didn't want abuse to be made into a contrived story.  Hence, for example, I intentionally kept Dot's teenage pregnancy a secret from everyone (including the GM) for a while.                        </div>

Within the bounds of a story game, I think it's more difficult and delicate to confront sexual abuse than a broken leg, regardless of how much suffering the <i>characters</i> of Jake or Sally are enduring.                        </div>

If you were playing Sally, and I was playing Jake, and you got mad at me for playing Jake for the snivelling whiner that he is, I'd say, "What's your problem, Brand?  Yeah, Jake's a snivelling whiner.  How's Sally going to react to that?"  I can only dominate the game if you let me.<br/>

But if Sally went up to Jake and slapped him across the face and said, "Snap out of it, you snivelling little whiner!  Worse things than this happen to people every day, and they're not curled up in a ball!  You get hurt, you heal, you come back... and if you don't, you die.

bq. but allowing it to a minor character seems like trivializing it.<br/>
<br/>
In retrospect I realize that I've never dwelt on the act of abuse itself, at all.  From an authorial stance, I'm repelled because of how frequently and lightly it _has_ been used, especially in late 80's media.  It seems like the motivation for everything had to be childhood sexual abuse, from hauntings to serial killers, and making it "the worst thing ever" in that era simultaneously made it cliched -- and ultimately trivialized it.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, those characters were abusive, even if I never really thought that about them, and I was dwelling on what that made them, what it implied about them, and how it effected them.<br/>
<br/>
In the same vein, Brand's story about the femme fatal resonates.  In the same way I have routinely discarded sexual abuse as orignal cause of arbitrary external horror, I can see how embracing it as the cause of an internal horror was very effective.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Brand: <br/>
<br/>
bq. Thanks for the answers! For the record, I find elves in TSOY to be much creepier than Demons in IN - and I would have loved to be a fly on the wall durring the elf/goblin conversation.<br/>
<br/>
You're welcome!  I agree: Lucretta was creepy and calous out of the gate.  Christian was a chariacture of evil from the start, and only developed any kind of depth over time.   As for the Elves and Goblins on love: if I knew where to find the player of Pendejo and he were cool I'd post it.  I'll email it to you if you like.                        </div>

<blockquote>In my opinion, what's difficult and delicate to confront, is suffering.<br/></blockquote>Okay.  In my opinion, some kinds of suffering are easy to confront, and some are difficult.<br/><br/>In my current Nobilis game, my PC is blind, horribly scarred, dying of cancer, and damned to hell when he does die.  His only two friends just died, and he's been looking for his missing son for decades without success.  And I'm like:  Fuck yeah, bitch!  Suffer!<br/><br/>If my GM comes to me and says "hey, I want to do a story arc about Stranger.  Can I give him the choice between killing his daughter and allowing the concept of healing to be scourged from Creation?"  then I'm like:  "Fuck yeah, bitch!  Suffer!"<br/><br/>If my GM comes to me and says "hey, I want to do a story arc about Stranger.  Can I have his son kidnapped and sold to be a child prostitute in the most hellish part of southeast Asia, kept physically and mentally the same age by drugs all this time?"  then I'm like "uh, wait."<br/><br/>The line here, for me, is this:  it is difficult and delicate to confront the suffering of those <i>who are deprived of agency.</i>  Even though all the players around the table are grownups, it's hard to overcome my ethical bright line of informed consent.  The example I used above is of an enslaved, developmentally disabled child; any of those qualifiers--slavery, childhood or mental disability--is sufficient to make an instance of suffering hard to confront.  For me.                        </div>

                            Judson<br/><br/>randomninjas at gmail dot com, thanks!<br/><br/>John, <br/><br/>Most of the issue of using abuse as a story hog element came back in the day when I was playing under assumed social contracts of "we are all a group and the IC PCs need to take care of and watch out for each other/must all be a big circle of geek social fallacy friends." Under that paradigm it was pretty easy for a character who was "the abuse victim" (as strongly opposed to a character who has been abused) to trump any in character conflict by having a weeping, hysterical break down in which the fact that we disagreed with the character was held to be the same as, or a psychic mirroring of the orriginal abuse. <br/><br/>The other tactic that was used, both in those groups and on MUSHes that had a similar assumption of social contract (if you don't care about other PCs as though they were your friends, as many of us are playing our virutal selves and a rejection of character is a rejection of self, you are worthelss as a person) was to have the character get abused, reabused, or flash-backy at moments when the player felt they weren't getting enough attention in the game. So right in the middle of a tense negotiation scene, Mary Sue would start howling because the man we were talking to reminded her of the man who abused her. Or Mary Sue would come stumbling into our headquarters, beaten and bloody and weeping -- for the fourth time this campaign. <br/><br/>Now these days, post Forge talk, social contract, knowing that OOC communication is okay, its much easier to deal with those things. But because the issue is sticky, it can still be difficult to tell when lines are being pushed. <br/><br/>For example: <br/><br/>Fred, what would your response be if in your hypotheical you asked the question "What's your problem, Brand? Yeah, Jake's a snivelling whiner. How's Sally going to react to that?"  and I answered, "She isn't, she thinks he is below contempt. But really, it isn't about Sally, I'm telling you that your character annoys me, OOC, and I don't find his trauma meaningful, OOC." <br/><br/>Cause fuck... I don't think I'd be that harsh, but sometimes shit comes out of my mouth that I can't take back, you know?                        </div>

If you were to say that to me, Brand, then where I went next would depend on our social contract.<br/>

If we were playing IWNAY then I'd say, "Woo hoo!  Good.  If Sally won't react to him, how about you bring in a character who will?"<br/>

<i>To Fred:</i> Well, but I presume that you're a human playing with other humans.  :-)  So given our tendency, doesn't that mean that sexual abuse is different in some way?  <br/><br/>Speaking personally, I know that I've had a lot of broken legs, worse injuries, and even murder and death appear in my games "on-screen" -- but I've never had on-screen rape or sexual child abuse.  So for me and the people I have played with, we do set our lines differently for sexual abuse and non-sexual abuse.  <br/><br/>If your experiences are different, I'd like to hear about them -- even if it's the same as how you dealt with non-sexual abuse.  If you've had other abuse and not sexual abuse in your game, is it just random or do you think there's a reason?  <br/><br/><i>To Brand</i>:  The story hog mode is interesting, though I've never experienced it myself.  I think it's similar to my concerns, though -- i.e. that's similar to what I was afraid would happen.  For me as Dot's player, say, I was worried that NPCs would burst out about their babies and/or pregnancies or somesuch.                        </div>

                            So, I see a common theme to both Brand's comments on story-hogs and Fred's on the visceral hairyness of sexual abuse.  <br/>
<br/>
To whit, I think it's useful to have techniques to de-emphasize sexual abuse when it appears in the game.  The potential problem to head off here is that bringing it into the game threatens to hog all the attention of the game.  So there needs to be a way to bring it in without trivializing it, and without taking over.  <br/>
<br/>
I think something that several people have done is to include abuse in pre-game background without making it explicit from the start.  i.e. A given character has abuse in their background, but everyone gets to know the character without knowing about the abuse.  Some time later, it comes out.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if something similar can work for sexual abuse during the course of the game.  In principle, it could be brought up as a possibility rather than a defined truth.  i.e. Someone is rescued from a prison and seems traumatized, but it isn't made explicit what happened to him.  Does that seem workable as an approach?  Any thoughts on how it would compare to explicit truth?                        </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>I'm not sure. However, if abuse was handled as an issue, same as other issues then something like Prime Time Adventures could be useful -- your screne presence tells you how much your issue should be dominating this episode. So when it's low it isn't that you don't show it, its just that you keep it in the background. <br/><br/>So if you had a bunch of 1's and 2's and then a 3 in your season, in the 1s you get rescued, you're messed up but seem okay. In the 2s you start showing behavioral changes: maybe self-destructive, maybe loss of trust, maybe lots of things. Then at the end of the episode before your 3 it starts to come out what really happened. Then on the 3 you step on up. <br/><br/>After that you probably go into a cycle of 1s and 2s again, dealing with how you're handling the issue, getting/not getting therapy, and so on. It's an issue, but its back to non-domination.                        </div>

bq. I think sexual abuse is one of a number of concepts that have visceral, instinctive reactions, as human beings.<br/>
<br/>
One of the little tidbits that ahs always stuck with me was from an Antropology course I took as a whim elective.  Which is: the only universal taboo is nuclear family incest.  So, while I agree that there's a visceral reaction to power-biased sexual scenes, I think there's a huge underpinning to cultural reactions to sex and the roles of children/our responsibilities towards the weak.<br/>
<br/>
The story hog thing reminds me strongly of how sexual abuse was (ab)used in popular media - it's like it justified any plot contrivance, and the result was it got hackneyed.  That has a lot to do with my stance on it -- it's really really easy to hit the "generic abuse setup" button with any mention of abuse.                        </div>

<p>I would like to point something out: One in five people was sexually abused as a child.</p>
<p>All this talk about playing with someone who has been abused, and what that would be like?</p>

                            Whoops, Brand, I totally missed your question back there.
<blockquote>"Do you think that there is something in that GM-individual relationship, players-non-individual relationship model that makes it harder to do abuse stories well? I mean, would it be easier or harder to deal with it if every member of the group was fully responsible to every member of the group?<br/></blockquote>Easier, I think, as long as everybody at the table understood that web of responsibility.  I'd approach abuse in Capes or Universalis the same way I talked about doing as GM, or in Polaris--up-front determination of everybody's willingness to go IWNAY; small steps; decompression; re-evaluate after each game.<br/><br/>Now, Sorcerer or PTA, where players have explicit control over certain aspects of the situation without the responsibility for providing opposition--that'd be risky.  Even if you go around the table and say "we have a social contract not to abandon each other; we each have a responsibility to challenge everyone else"--those are just words until you get used to the idea that your opposition may come from anywhere.  The risk, I think, is first and foremost of being blindsided.                        </div>
