I don't think this is necessarily a highly 'game-able' sort of scenario (at least not long term).  <br/><br/>I started with each telling them that they were going to help me continue to develop my homerules for Amber using \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d as a scenario to test player vs. player conflict.  I made it clear to them before we started playing there would be betrayal and that I might change the rules several times.  <br/><br/>The entire game lasted around 4 hours with breaks.  The rules mods from Amber Diceless for those interested are as follows:<br/><br/>Each Player has 20 points (this is scaled 5:1 from the 100 points in the ADRPG) each to make two characters, a Protagonist ie. Prisoner, and an Antagonist ie. Number 2 <br/>Players may rank in Strength, Warfare, Psyche, and Endurance as per the ADRPG.<br/>Players may also choose additional Traits of their own creation.  <br/>For those who know about my rule changes we did not use Aspects or Passions for this game.<br/>No Powers for the Prisoner, although each Protagonist had a free trait \u201cAmberite with Amnesia\u201d (3) this could be used to try power-like effects but no guarantees.  <br/>The Antagonist had a free trait \u201cIn Control of the Village\u201d (5) this could be used for most any effect in Shadow Earth.  <br/>The Antagonist character may also buy Conjuration 4pts or Sorcery 3pts.<br/>Protagonist characters each have one Secret (my real name is Corwin)<br/>The player has 10 Good Stuff to share between their Protagonist and Antagonist characters<br/>To \u2018win\u2019 a conflict you must have a Trait higher than the adversary (most specific Trait +1), +1 win but messy take a lasting consequence, +2 win with a consequence, +3 win outright.   Good Stuff may add new Traits into the conflict if relevant or +1 for each point spent to resolve the conflict. <br/><br/><br/>The players made two characters each, Charles made his Prisoner as follows:<br/><br/>Strength: 2<br/>Warfare: 4<br/>Psyche: A<br/>Endurance: 8<br/>Explore: 5<br/>Musician: 1<br/>Amberite with Amnesia: 3<br/><br/><br/>He made his number Two as follows (did not get to play him though):<br/><br/>Strength: A<br/>Warfare: 8<br/>Psyche: 5<br/>Endurance: A <br/>Surreptitious: 7<br/>In Control of the Village: 5<br/><br/><br/>Margaret made the following Prisoner:<br/><br/>Strength: 3<br/>Warfare: 7<br/>Psyche: 2<br/>Endurance: 5<br/>Soldier: 3<br/>Amberite with Amnesia: 3<br/><br/><br/>She made a number Two as follows:<br/><br/>Strength: A<br/>Warfare: 15<br/>Psyche: A<br/>Endurance:  5<br/>In Control of the Village: 5<br/><br/><br/>The order of play went Charles as the Prisoner, Margaret as the Antagonist (1.5 hrs).   Then I told them I wanted to see another scenario with the same players and relationships (1.5 hrs).  Then I let Charles play the Antagonist but told him to play as his Prisoner character (I said I really wasn\u2019t happy with some interactions in the last session).  After this if Charles had positive Good Stuff he really was Corwin and we went to an end game with Dworkin waking him up from a therapy session.  If Zero or less Good Stuff he was not Corwin and we would narrate something messy.  <br/><br/>To start the game, we borrowed the opening narration (cue fuzzy vision and quiet but dramatic music):<br/><br/>"Where am I?"<br/>"In the Village."<br/>"What do you want?"<br/>"Information."<br/>"Whose side are you on?"<br/>"That would be telling\u2026. We want information. Information! INFORMATION!"<br/>"You won't get it."<br/>"By hook or by crook, we will."<br/>"Who are you?"<br/>"The new Number Two." <br/>"Who is Number One?"<br/>"You are Number Six." <br/>"I am not a number \u2014 I am a free man!"<br/>Number Two just laughs.<br/><br/>The characters start wherever in time/location (on Shadow Earth) the Antagonist wants.  Margaret chose Paris just before the German invasion (1940).<br/><br/><br/>Next, the first session\u2026.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
