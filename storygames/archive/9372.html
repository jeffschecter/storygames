Do NOT try to memorize them nor would I recommend referring to them in game (at least not often).  Instead try and get a feel for the logic and pattern behind them.  Then in play just rely on your understanding of the logic and pattern to count factors to set your own Obs.<br/>\n<br/>\nRun a few practice conflicts.  You can even incorporate this into the game by having all of your players characters do a training scene where they are sparring each other on teams.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure the player handing over the helping die actually says what they are doing to help.  Encouraging some narrative flair here will help build the fiction...which is just as important as getting the bonus die.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might get some disagreement here, but I recommend being a bit hard core about not allowing your players to overly stretch their abilities.  Allow some creative uses using movie logic once, but don't let them keep drawing from the well.  Don't let the rubber banding set precedent.  For example the first time a mouse seeks to get an advantage in a fight by calling upon their Geology Wise to find a good throwing rock that can be cool.  But calling Geology wise into every fight...not so cool IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207839/#Comment_207839" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-17T19:15:03+00:00" title="May 17, 2009  7:15PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2009 7:15PM by J_Walton.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On Ralph's point about practice conflicts, so far I've started every game with a Journey/Weather conflict where the patrol travels from Lockhaven (or wherever) to the location they have been assigned to visit as part of the mission.  Losing such a conflict is not necessarily a big deal, just an excuse for a complication, so they make great practice conflicts while still allowing you to get on with the game.

It certainly helps you as a GM feel more confident about the Obs you are setting and avoid hemming and hawing.  That said, when planning out the mission obstacles for the session, take a few moments to factor each challenge according to the book and write down the resulting Ob.  It helps things flow more smoothly in play.<br><br>Also on the subject of factoring obs.  Keep in mind you don't have to select a factor off every category provided for a given skill.  Keep a sharp eye out for which categories are significant for any given challenge.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207966/#Comment_207966" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T11:54:39+00:00" title="May 18, 2009 11:54AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, require the players to specifically describe how they assist rolls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208187/#Comment_208187" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T14:05:53+00:00" title="May 19, 2009  2:05PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, everybody!
