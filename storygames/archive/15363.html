We started off with a fairly light domestic tale of a teenage brother &amp; sister squabbling with each other and outsmarting their strict babysitter/housekeeper; then, midway, there was a darker scene in which a boy the sister knew tried to get her into bed, but the remainder of the film returned to a light tone, being a soft revenge comedy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe left-field contribution was the Cat Cam: on his first turn, one of the player's created a webcam that was attached to the pet cat Bootsy's collar; then, on my next turn, I chose to play the cat as my viewpoint character! Hmmm... it was fun, and it was rewarding to push the system hard to see if we could break it, but its definitely one of those things that bears discussion up-front before starting a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith time for a feedback discussion afterwards, I was able to write a second draft of the game text, incorporating two major revisions:<br/>\n- First, a 'write the ticket' section at the start of play, giving questions to be answered about the film's rating, genre, tone and premise.<br/>\n- Second, the removal of the viewpoint character rules: making all the characters shared equally by all players creates more freedom in a game that already has numerous restrictions on what you can and can't do.<br/>\n<br/>\nA very good &amp; productive session overall, which really boosted my enthusiasm for playing the game again soon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389700/#Comment_389700" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T14:51:31+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  2:51PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just redfrafted this: it had evolved a neat card mechanic that had taken over the game to such an extent that the camerawork aspects had become mere colour.
