It was a fun, but rough, ride. <br/><br/>Here are the facts. I was Watcher, and I had three players. We played the first Act of "Breakout", and the players chose Captain America, Wolverine, and Iron Man as their heroes. They faced Count Nefaria, the mob of villains, and Living Laser. The preamble and defeating those three opponents took us about four hours of play.<br/><br/>We began with Cap on his way to DC in a helicopter, Iron Man at a fundraiser on Long Island, and Wolverine at a dock on the East River; all as suggested in the Event text. Cap's helicopter took a hit of lightning and had to land on the Raft helipad. Iron Man suited up once the blackout hit and flew over to the Raft. Wolverine, alone with no X-Jet, opted to swim to the Raft; we did an action roll vs. the doom pool, and he passed it pretty handily.<br/><br/>Once all our heroes were at the Raft, it was a pretty straight-up fight vs the above villains. Nefaria appeared first along with the mob; Living Laser showed up a round or two later.<br/><br/>Overall, I made the key mistakes of: 1) not following <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=16004" rel="nofollow">John Stavropoulos' Watcher Cheat Sheet</a>, and 2) not paying enough attention to the details of the Event (e.g., there were boats at the dock Wolverine could have used, I didn't make Scene Distinctions clear enough, etc.). I biffed a lot of rules, so we had a lot of discussion bookending most of the die-rolling.<br/><br/>Since I did not adequately explain stunts, complications, and assets, the battle saw players rolling the same combos over and over again. They questioned why Cap would ever do anything other than throw his shield, for example.<br/><br/>Overall, their impression was that the game moved pretty slow. They advised me later that I should have made less use of the Doom Pool initially, letting it build up for use later so that things would move faster at the beginning. Not sure I can fault them on that, honestly. I was just trying to get used to the rules.<br/><br/>And this happened about five minutes in...<br/><br/>Watcher: "Okay, Wolverine, you pull yourself up from the East River on to the landing pad at the Raft. Captain America is there and you see a number of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents."<br/><br/>Cap: "Hey, Wolverine! Do you want to join the New Avengers?"<br/><br/>Wolverine: "Sure."<br/><br/>Cap: "10xp, please."<br/><br/>This was pretty indicative of how my players felt about Milestones. We even had a protracted email debate afterwards where they made the case that Milestones were inherently "bad design" and "got in the way of the story". E.g., "What if one player's Milestone makes them take actions that prevent another player from hitting their Milestone? That's broken." While I agreed that many of the provided Milestones in the book are very weak, I didn't think that invalidated Milestones as a concept. Still, it made me wonder how other gamers raised on trad RPGs are going to feel about Milestones.<br/><br/>Anyway, while I'm bummed that this group now has no interest in ever playing MHRP again, I do feel a lot more confident about running the same Event at <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/general-rpg-discussion/319338-chicago-gameday-31-3-17-sign-up-play.html" rel="nofollow">Gameday 31</a>. I am definitely going to: 1) use John's sheet more strictly, 2) pay better attention to the Event details, and 3) teach the rules more through examples in play than any sort of info-dump at the start of the session.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367117/#Comment_367117" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T09:09:12+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  9:09AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off, a big bonk on the head for not explaining half the rules to them.  No wonder they had a negative experience -- you ignored stunts, assets and...gulp...complications?  So clearly rolling the same dice pool over and over isn't going to yield a good experience.  I've run Breakout 3 times and when players know about the little fiddly-bits they leapt into action doing cool and amazing Marvel-style things -- earning PP, stunting on complications and earning at that whopping D10, and creating assets in play to do more amazing stuff.<br/><br/>As for Milestones, it sounds like they didn't get on board with the same creative agenda if they're thinking that Milestones get in the way of story.  If anything, they help create it by establishing character-focused (and appropriately Marvel universe) goals in play.<br/><br/>Also, I've found that 10 XP Milestones are best for campaign play because they have longer-term consequence.  For a one shot, it's kind of easy to say that Wolverwine joins the New Avengers because, um why not, but in campaign play there would probably be bigger issues for Wolverine to deal with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367123/#Comment_367123" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T09:21:45+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  9:21AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Denys</cite>Also, I've found that 10 XP Milestones are best for campaign play because they have longer-term consequence.

I suspect you will do an even better job in less time!<br/><br/>Although to be fair, the act of creating cheat sheets helped me internalize the rules. Those first 3 games I did so many things wrong! Actually, thinking back, even that 4th game had plenty of mistakes! <br/><br/>But once you get past the initial learning curve the game becomes RIDICULOUSLY easy. I wish there wasn't such a learning curve (and the text was clearer in parts and easier to reference). But now I feel I can run this game with almost no effort. It's to the point where I've been able to turn players into GMs by the middle of the game and then walk away and read a comic book! But the ride to that point was bumpy. <br/><br/>I'm hoping my experience will mean you'll have less work to do.<br/><br/><br/>If someone has played Cortex+ games before, Marvel Heroic will feel familiar. But if they're used to Mutants &amp; Masterminds, Marvel FASERIP, or Champions... oh man, culture clash! That said, all the people I played with who had no RPG experience seemed ok with everything. <br/><br/>Two Champions GMs I ran for HATED, absolutely hated Marvel Heroic. But then a week later they were asking if they could play again now that they realigned their expectations. One even bought the game! <br/><br/>But no game is for everyone. Even if the result of your game is that someone decides the game isn't for them, you've done them a service! <br/><br/><br/>Another light at the end of the tunnel... the Villain Creation rules are amazing and easy! I'm working on a cheat sheet so that I can make characters on the fly mid-game. They are wonderful tools for improv gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367126/#Comment_367126" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T09:31:29+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  9:31AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read the rules, but could one just take Milestones out for one-shots?

Instead, things are kinda... tactically emergent, if that makes any sense.  It's kinda like "play to find out what happens" but from a mechanical standpoint.  Like: do whatever it is Captain American does in this situation (guided by a few signposts like milestones and stats) and figure out what happens based on the mechanics, rather than always tailoring your action to get the most bang for your buck. Your drive for excitement and sense of character are supposed to be the main motivation for your fictional choices, not the mechanical bonuses, but the bonuses are written to support you and generally back up the kinds of things you're likely to want to do as Captain America.<br/><br/>And then sometimes, when it's REALLY IMPORTANT that you succeed (big stakes, somebody's injured, etc.), you look down at your sheet and try to figure out where that extra die or two is coming from (like you constantly do in Burning Wheel). But that's not intended to be the default way that you approach the game.<br/><br/>Is that potentially part of the disconnect?

The most important part of introducing the game to people is clearly establishing the creative agenda that fosters play. When you just info dump the players, everyone comes in with their own bagage, and it makes it very difficult to manage expectations.<br/><br/>Ok, then now I understand what a huge problem with getting people to grasp this game is:<br/><br/>I want all the dice. I want all the dice every round. I want all the dice every round perhaps because I like Challenge (so I wanna use them to kill Venom) but also, more than that, because it's <i>really easy</i> to get all the dice every round. Like: just say and do Captain America stuff and I keep getting all the dice.<br/><br/>Also, oddly (and on purpose, I think) "winning" mad dice and adding detail and richness to the story <i>are tied together</i>.

The main issue I've seen with teaching it is that the choice of die is not particularly significant - what's significant is the Plot Point economy, which the choice of die affects (hence the GREAT rule that superscientists can sometimes roll a bunch more lower die types when doing superscience, because only superscientists really screw up science in a comic book), but doesn't really control.<br/><br/>The building of the die pool is really the least important thing in the system, although it takes the most time and has most of the character sheet - what matters is how many 1s you roll, how many Plot Points you have/get/spend, and what the Doom Pool is like.<br/><br/>So knocking yourself out to use that shield every single turn is actually counterproductive - it is not as effective as it might appear at first glance.  It's not just that the game isn't really about that? It's that it's just wrong to think the most effective way to play is to get a die pool full of d12s every time you need to roll something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367175/#Comment_367175" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T11:13:48+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 11:13AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well if you can have a d12 or a d10 or nothing you take the d12.

Power gaming in Marvel is fun!<br/><br/>I love it when players grab as many dice as possible. In most cases, grabbing those dice reinforces the character they are playing (Captain America Leading By Example D8, flipping around with Enhanced Reflexes D8, using his shield as a Weapon D8, and using his Combat Mastery D10 to take down Villains is awesome). And more dice means they may win now but it also means they are more likely to roll 1s which grows the Doom Pool! As the Doom Pool grows, the story gets much more tense and exiting. And if the Doom Pool grows to 2D12, the GM can end the scene before you have a chance to accomplish your goals!<br/><br/>A problem with Milestones is certain Milestones are written poorly. But some are amazing. Take Iron Man's BLEEDING EDGE TECH:<br/><br/>- 1 XP when you first shutdown a power.<br/>- 3 XP when you\u2019ve shutdown all the powers in the Powered Armor power set, or you recover your Weapons Platform power set after using your EMP SFX.<br/>- 10 XP when you choose to abandon your armor or defeat a villain with all powers shutdown.<br/><br/>We had a player Power Game the above Milestone and it made for amazing fun! <br/><br/>But Captain America's "when you either convince a hero to join a new Avengers team or disband your existing team" 10 XP Milestone makes a lot of sense in terms of following the Breakout Event which mimics what happened in the comics but has felt strange in play as an RPG. What works in comics doesn't always work as an RPG. Iron Man's Milestone works great for game play and emulating comics. Captain America's has felt cheesy. I know it is supposed to be a big deal, and it is in the comic, but not at the gaming table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367186/#Comment_367186" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T11:42:11+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 11:42AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Denys</cite>First off, a big bonk on the head for not explaining half the rules to them.

I will say that the game really does support picking up as many dice as you can, and the "if you do it, do it" approach to deciding what happens in the fiction. But it clearly supports some other styles of play, too, based on the feedback I've got so far. But not EVERYTHING.<br/><br/>Case in point, folks looking for an RPG to act as a physics engine for their super hero avatars by which they can finally settle who is stronger, Hulk, Thor, or Hercules, run into problems. MHR doesn't actually do that very well, chiefly because it's a comic book RPG more than a supers RPG. I think the latter is a kind of construct formed out of D&amp;D and it's spinoffs and continues as a genre all on its own, much as D&amp;D is kind of its own genre.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Cam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367299/#Comment_367299" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T16:49:42+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  4:49PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If MHRPG is anything like Danger Patrol (it is, a little) then yeah, go ahead and grab all the dice you can.

Being the strongest person on the planet is more important that the exact weight you can lift. Real world physics also takes a back seat to super hero drama.<br/><br/>If you want, In some limited ways you can play Marvel Heroic as if you are a Comic Book writer. For example, using a Distinction against yourself. But for the most part, you have very minimal narrative control. Even calling Plot Points... Plot Points... is a bit off as they don't really allow you to change the plot in a writerly manner. We end up calling them Power Points more often than not. And using Distinctions against yourself is optional and I've played with people who ignore this aspect of the game all together.<br/><br/>You can play Marvel Heroic as if you are a super hero (not a comic book writer) and it works great. I've now played Marvel Heroic with 45+ different people and many of them played in a completely immersive style and it worked great. <br/><br/>I also love Marvel FASERIP. I've easily played it with over 100+ people for 18 years and it has its strengths and weaknesses. I actually feel more like a super hero in Marvel Heroic primarily because I don't end up whiffing frequently like in Marvel FASERIP. And both games have meta elements that break immersion for many people. That said, I love Marvel FASERIP and will continue to play it but the distinction above rings untrue to me. <br/><br/>That said, there are Story Games where you are more writer than character. Prime Time Adventures is one example. And that can also be a fun way to play depending on your interests. So I can see why someone might make the assumption Marvel Heroic is also primarily this way. <br/><br/>At our first Marvel Launch party, we had 2 Champions players and 1 Marvel FASERIP player say the equivalent of, "wow, I really feel like I'm Spider-Man / Iron-Man / Captain America."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367344/#Comment_367344" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T20:36:29+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  8:36PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I also find that players are really happy to activate their own limits if it means earning an extra Plot Point to counter attack after they succeed at a reaction roll.<br/><br/>Count Nefaria energy blasts Captain America!<br/><br/>Captain blocks the attack by more than 5 and has a D12 effect die left over but no Plot Points to spend!<br/><br/>GM:<br/><br/>"Wow, how cool would it be if you had a Plot Point right now to take out Nefaria just by defending yourself!

Writers get into the heads of their characters, too, after all. The notion that you have to choose between the character's approach and the writer's approach is something of a fallacy. I argued hard and often that players should get to have the feeling that they're not <i>just</i> playing their favorite superheroes but that they're <i>also</i> writing for them as a comics writer does.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about the way that Marvel Heroic turned out is that you can move into the character's head for some decisions and back out to the writer's head for other decisions.

(i.e. a lot of the rules-work they put in is suddenly unnecessary if you pull of the German Board Game To Panel Description alchemy which the designers want to be a feature, not a bug)<br/><br/>-I wonder about important purely mechanical fiddly bits like where you can choose two dice of lower value instead of one die of a higher value (with no in-fiction justification, you just make that mechanical choice so you have a higher or lower effect die) or saving a PP to use to add an extra die to the added up numbers in the pool rather than using it in some other way. If you go with the "you describe, I assign" approach you are chucking out the part of the game where players fiddle with these bits. Which means these bits are, in this more trad approach, now kinda there for no reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367529/#Comment_367529" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T10:41:23+00:00" title="March 14, 2012 10:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The above approach didn't restrict any of those mechanical options. <br/><br/>It primarily made sure that Trait use made sense in the specific given situation which will be highly subjective depending on the specific people playing. This is playing the game rules as written. For example, Complication Traits last either till the end of an Action Scene or till they no longer make any sense, which is determined by the the verisimilitude of the fictional situation and the suspension of disbelief of the specific players. So if Spider-Man webs a Villain who can Phase. Once they Phase, those webs are no longer considered a valid Complication, even if it isn't the end of the Action Scene. <br/><br/>I wouldn't suggest using the "you describe, I assign" technique with Marvel Heroic. You could do it, but it would make the game very slow and a lot of the mechanics would be wasted and needless. <br/><br/>In terms of fiddly mechanics like, "do I use my two highest dice for my total, or do I keep one for my effect", some players loved this! They became immersed in the possibilities. Where other player didn't care. I like that the game works with both approaches. If 1 person power games their dice poll, and another just uses whatever, it's still fun (for them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

The size of the effect die is a relatively minimal side effect - what you're actually doing when you make that decision is increasing your chances of rolling 1s and getting Plot Points and increasing the Doom Pool.

You guys are posting quickly! Or maybe I'm slow. <br/><br/>I'm not sure why I disagree with JDCorley. <br/><br/>Ok, I found 2 places where I disagree:<br/><br/>1. Bucky did come back the last few years. Then he died again, then was back a month later. But Gwen and Uncle Ben are still gone. I think. It's hard to keep up! Ok, I'm not actually disagreeing with Jason here. Most people in Comics don't stay dead. Maybe I only disagree with Jason on one thing...<br/><br/>2. You can die in Marvel Heroic. If Trauma Steps Up beyond D12, your character dies. Maybe I'm still not disagreeing here with Jason! Characters die in Marvel comics all the time. And that can happen in Marvel Heroic as well. But do they stay dead? This is also true in D&amp;D. Life may be cheap in early levels but that doesn't mean you have to stay dead.

Got it. Yes, you are right, a way of playing the game does not go away when a character dies. The game is played the "same way" for basically everyone.  There are no unique-to-the-character mechanics or choices other than SFX (and maybe Milestones in a way, though I don't necessarily think that's a great match), and those are much more rarely used than the other aspects of the character sheet.  So yes, you're right! If you're looking for a game that, when a character dies, you lose a way of playing the game, don't play this game.<br/><br/>Although I somewhat dispute your characterization that "trad RPGs" (this is a stupid term, but I grumblingly know what you mean) "usually" make you give up a way of playing the game when your character dies.  They really don't, at least the ones I've played don't. GURPS isn't like that unless you move from one optional rule set to another (say, I have a social based character and then I do something in the martial arts subsystem after they die), D20-based games aren't (necessarily) like that, Call of Cthulhu SURE as hell isn't like that,  oVampire isn't like that unless you move into or out of one of the specialty clans (Malkavian, Nosferatu), and so on.  I agree that D&amp;D is like that, in all editions, so if you're looking for that, D&amp;D is a great fit.  Anyway, that can be a discussion for another time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367628/#Comment_367628" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T14:21:52+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  2:21PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 2:58PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>There are some very large differences.

That give me a....plus 2?"<br/>GM: "Yep."<br/><br/>_<br/><br/>Player: "I have the high ground, do I get an advantage?"<br/><br/>GM: "Yep, says right there--High ground +2, there you go"<br/>-<br/>Player: "I have the high ground, do I get an advantage?"<br/><br/>GM: "Yep, I'm gonna say yes, how about +3?"<br/>_<br/>Player: "I have the high ground, do I get an advantage?"<br/><br/>GM: "No"<br/><br/>Player: "Ok"<br/>_<br/>Player: "I have the high ground, do I get an advantage?"<br/><br/>GM: "No"<br/><br/>Player: "WTF?"<br/><br/>(argument or sadness ensues)<br/>(I have noticed that the frequency with which this last scenario occurred in one's gaming life often dramatically affects how one views trad play and how often one invokes the phrase "mother may I" in gaming discussions)<br/><br/><br/>_____<br/><br/>Beancounting:<br/><br/>Player: "I can either have the High Ground or I can Strike From Below and Strike From Below gives me +1 more so I'm doing that..."<br/>_<br/><br/>Player: "I have the high ground, do I get an advantage?"<br/><br/>GM: "No, but if you act like your character and thereby evoke your Hates Laundromats trait you will"<br/>_<br/>Player: "I have the high ground, do I get an advantage?"<br/><br/>GM: "Yes, and if you act like your character and thereby evoke your Hates Laundromats trait you will get another"<br/>_<br/><br/>Player: "Ok, aaaaaaand...to get one more die I need to be a Sentinel of Liberty or a Good Example, mmmmm...Ok, 'If I defeat this menace alone I will show that one ordinary man can face any adversity!'"<br/><br/>_<br/>Player 1: "I am choosing to roll 2d8s rather than 1d10 for this one."<br/>Player 2: "Why?"<br/>Player 1: "Because...(some reason that--in terms of helping player 1's PC beat The Scorpion, make sense)<br/>___<br/><br/>In that Clouds-and-Boxes essay, i believe beancounting is when the How to Kick The Bad Guy's Butt thought process goes from the guy's head to the dice and then to the imagination cloud rather than from the guy's head to the cloud and <i>then</i> to the dice. <br/><br/>Or, put another way: in nonbeancounting your PC must do things that would grant tactical advantage in the fiction to gain tactical advantage in the fiction whereas in beancounting the player <i>must</i> do things which serve other non-tactic-oriented playgoals of the system to gain tactical advantage.<br/><br/>__<br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>I am not assuming this is how Heroic has to work. Jenskot is, I believe, saying it does not.<br/><br/>Some ways of playing D&amp;D are like this and I don't like them either.<br/><br/>I am also not saying this is all that bad (yes, "beancounting" is a perjorative word, sorry) it just is not how I want to roll.<br/><br/>Beancouting can be part of any game. The question is whether it's high or low and whether it's essential to success in certain certain modes of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367629/#Comment_367629" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T14:25:06+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  2:25PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 14, 2012 2:27PM by Zak S.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> Call of Cthulhu SURE as hell isn't like that,</blockquote>\nIn my experience, Cthulhu PCs in a continuing campaign (rather than one-shots) end up so thoroughly tied to the setting or story by the(ir) end that it's impossible to reproduce a PC that works the same way the old one did once it dies.<br/><br/>You mileage has clearly varied.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367634/#Comment_367634" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T14:31:13+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  2:31PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't make sense, you're putting tons of very disparate stuff together and naming it something that has no relation whatsoever with what you're describing.

Jenskot is, I believe, saying it does not.</blockquote>\nI'm not saying that Marvel Heroic does not have beancounting as you describe it above. If I said this or gave this impression, I miscommunicated. What I am saying (or intended to say) is that I have run Marvel Heroic for players who love beancounting, and for those who don't care about beancounting, and it worked reasonably well. <br/><br/>For example, I've had players who get all excited by the idea that they can micromanage their resources and split their Specialty D10 die into 2d8. I've had other players who don't want to do that, so they don't. Personally I wish their was a fictional reason for it. Since it's tied to your Specialty, I see it as working patiently and carefully but maybe that's me stretching to find a justification. My default preference is for the mechanics to be tied to the fiction. Generally playing with mixed groups has been more work for me as a GM, but has worked well. With 1 exception! <br/><br/>If you don't use Plot Points you've earned, it can be a significant disadvantage. That said, I've had players who have both never read a comic, and never played an RPG, and they had no problem with Plot Point as long as I was there to help them. For example, I'll say... you defended so well, and momentum is on your side (I often describe Plot Points as momentum), you can spend a Plot Point to counter attack right now! Usually people get all excited and jump at the chance. Then they get frustrated when they don't have Plot Points and want more!<br/><br/>I have to also say, we've had plenty of confusion over the name Plot Points. You can't edit the Plot with them. It makes players who dislike narrative control outside their character nervous, and confuses new players (so far). A lot of comic book fans don't think of comics in terms of plot. Karma as a name made more sense (to me). Usually saying Power Points or Momentum has solved the problem when it comes up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367702/#Comment_367702" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T18:26:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  6:26PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Usually saying Power Points or Momentum has solved the problem when it comes up.</blockquote>\nMy players saw the "PP" acronym and immediately started calling them "Power Points", possibly before I had even articulated that they were called "Plot Points".<br/><br/>I've played some <i>Serenity</i> before, so I already associate "Plot Points" with Cortex.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367733/#Comment_367733" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T20:18:02+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  8:18PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I designed the hero datafiles in the Basic Game (Cap, Iron Man, et al) I tried to provide a number of different "ways to play" despite the fact that every hero takes care of things in more or less the same way (grab dice from categories on sheet, roll dice, pick total and effect, etc).Iron Man's SFX and Milestones work to make him a more resource management character.
