But some of them decided to fight back, creating a company of like-minded beings (even other demons) to defend the Earth from supernatural threats. Today, the shadow company has it's hands in every facet of life all around the globe, using this grasp to police supernatural activity. Demon races that live on Earth (i.e. the aquatic Lochs, shapechanging Changelings, or even the pyrokinetic Burners) have joined the company as well, ensuring their safety as well as humanity's.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach agent arms themselves in a different way. Some become adepts, practitioners of magic who can learn from 18 unique and highly customizable Paths of Magic. Some enhance their body with cybernetic implants, chipping away a small portion of their humanity for the greater good. Some train heavily in the martial arts, learning to protect themselves without reliance on experimental technology or the very magic they seek to stop. Others meet somewhere in the middle. With almost limitless combinations of powers and abilities, they can dabble in many things and become well-rounded agents.<br/>\n<br/>\nWritten by Eloy Lasanta, "Apocalypse Prevention, Inc." is a 184-page corebook that details everything you need to become agents and protect the Earth. Uses the Dynamic Gaming System (DGS), with fully immersive character creation and combat mechanics and requires only a single D20 to play!

The Loch wearing surfer jams. It doesn't fit every character, but Jonah is one of the more lovable ones. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it uses a Attribute + skill + 1d20 mechanic with a short list of flexible skills. It's quick and easy to learn and implement, making it a good game for new and old players. I've never played Mutants &amp; Masterminds, so i can't speak on API's benefits against it, but I myself am not a fan of character levels (so my DGS system uses point-buys to build) or the over simplicity of most combat systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat in Apocalypse is quick, versatile, and brutal. It breaks each combat Round in Counts, with each Action and Reaction taking a certain amount of time and effort to perform. And it is the player's choice on their character's fighting styles based on their concept and their environment. Better description of characters' movements can gain them a bonus as well. This type of thing rewards good roleplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entirety of the system itself pushes Apocalypse Prevention, Inc. beyond others. Needing only 1d20 makes the game easy to use without it taking away from the story being told and the combat puts you in the character's shoes where you have to make every decision in a situation where you could lose it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say that I'm VERY proud of the game and how it turned out and my playtests all went swimmingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oni                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180293/#Comment_180293" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T13:09:57+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  1:09PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While task resolution and a stat+skill system tend to turn me off, I have to say the cover and what I've seen of the interior art is very, very nice.

In essence, you are creating another person or being from scratch, with brand new emotions, backgrounds, lifestyles, and whatnot. I tried my best to walk players through doing this to put them into their character's shoes. That's why it was coupled with the statement of the fully immersive combat mechanics as well, as i believe that i was able to accomplish that in and out of combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that answers your question!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Oni                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180529/#Comment_180529" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T16:03:33+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  4:03PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not really.<br><br>I'd like to know HOW you "tried [your] best to walk players through doing this to put them into their character's shoes".<br>Was it a matter of writing style?<br>Is there a mechanical part of character creation that makes it immersive?<br><br>What, specifically, is going on during character creation to make it an immersive experience?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/First%20Oni" title="First Oni"><img alt="First Oni" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/First%20Oni">First Oni</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180548/#Comment_180548" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T19:20:50+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  7:20PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2008 8:22PM by First Oni.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, i wouldn't say that there's a particular "mechanic" that makes character creation immersive.

Deciding on their motivation, to how their Attributes or Skills reflect who are they are as a person, and i give many examples, including a complete character creation walkthrough. Now, of course, that's the way it was intended to be used and how I run the game, but depending on the group, these methods could just as easily be ignored.
