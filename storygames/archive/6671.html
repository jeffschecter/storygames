It's largely civil. One of the questions that has come up is why people publish their games. I'm not just talking about why people write games. I mean, I do that too but I've not published any yet.<br/><br/>Here's the quote:<blockquote>I'm not an indie publisher, but I'm going to go way out on a limb here and speak for the vast majority of them. Here's what an indie publisher is doing and why they're doing it.<br/><br/>1) They're making a game that people will want to buy and that gives them a reasonable sense of pride in doing so.<br/>2) They want lots of people to buy their game so that they can make a whole pile of cash. They want that sense of pride so they can go swimming around in that pile of cash like Scrooge McDuck without that nagging voice inside them saying that they didn't earn that huge pile of money honestly. </blockquote>\n2) might well be humour, it's hard to say because I don't know the poster that well.<br/><br/>But anyway, I'm not trying to start an outraged indie avalanche on RPGnet, I wondered if anyone was willing to say here what the reasons are for publishing their games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147783/#Comment_147783" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T17:29:51+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  5:29PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By "publishing" you mean "printing as a book and making available for sale through some channel"?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust so I don't have to get on my publishing soapbox again...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147784/#Comment_147784" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T17:35:46+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  5:35PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll count pdf too if you're charging for it.

I'm constantly amused by it. It's educative and pays for itself, too, so there's no downside that I can see. More significantly, I find a sense of respect in the monies I'm paid for my work. It's not that I don't get respect in other ways as well, but that doesn't mean that money doesn't work. It's a status issue - I have to be pretty damn good at this to get people to actually pay me for it, and often enough that's the only kind of respect that you can look forward to. I don't particularly expect to ever score the Golden Dragon (the Finnish annual gamer culture award) with abrasive, non-mainstream indie games, so I might as well go for the next best thing, which is being one of the three people in Finland for whom rpgs are a CV issue. Some of the high points of my life and career are, quite literally, predicated on my being an indie game designer; I have great pride in being good enough to score a working grant from the Finnish Cultural Foundation for my design, for example. That's something many artists working in other areas never achieve, and definitely not if they're not serious professionals. It's also significant that my father is not particularly impressed by somebody having internet fans in Gambia, while he certainly is when somebody takes a hobby and turns it into a career. Considering these points it really would make little sense for me to "treat game design as a hobby" or whatever - the publishing side is an integral part of what makes it worthwhile for me in so many ways it's not even funny.<br/><br/>I can see where disbelief for these points comes from as well, of course - my own situation is that I am, basicly, an artist bum. If I weren't writing a roleplaying game, I'd be writing a novel or doing some whitecollar project stuff for some media or other. Making indie roleplaying games <i>synergizes extremely well</i> for a young person looking to make a career in the culture industry. The situation is entirely different for middle-aged IT professionals, professors or accountants with a family and a home loan, but for a person in my age and occupation it makes perfect sense to take indie game design seriously. Whether what I'm paid is more or less than I'd be making otherwise (hint: I make more in a week of project work than the average Finnish rpg does ever) is irrelevant when the work synergizes perfectly with my career plans and is what I love to do. That will not always be the case, but for now this is what I want to do and learn to do better, so this is where I'm at.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147797/#Comment_147797" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T18:29:24+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  6:29PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yours is a pretty special case, though.

I guess so. A linchpin for why I'd much rather write the new Solar System or finish the details on the English edition of my zombie game (rather than replace all the bw images in this #%"%# 400 page lame ruminant compendium I'm working on with color ones, say) is that I like gaming and want to develop better mousetraps. There is no intellectual satisfaction in doing paying work (which I guess is why it pays so well, in the end).<br/><br/>The point is, though, that if I didn't coordinate all this gaming-related work into a diminutive indie publishing company, a CV and a portfolio, I simply couldn't justify spending as much time with the hobby as I do. I can pretty securely say that I spend more time with culture over any given month than anybody who's not professionally engaged in the culture industry - that wouldn't be possible if I didn't synergize my hobby into what could be considered a part-time career. Most gamers don't have either the budget or free time I do, which means that I read more, write more and play more than anybody who can't just take a week or two and dedicate it to full-time gaming. I imagine that this holds true for many other indie publishers as well - we do this to be able to spend more time and money in our hobby than we otherwise could.<br/><br/>Of course the audience factor you mention is real, too - an artist has a need for expression in the first place because there is an audience. I wouldn't want to develop a better game if I didn't know that there are people who want and need that culture content to proceed with their own life. (Goes into philosophy here, but I should probably note that I don't have much congress with the American model of culture as consumption - it's not a simple consumer relationship when you become audience to somebody, it's an exhange of ideas and an opportunity to develop yourself. Perhaps that makes this easier to understand.)<br/><br/>A related issue here is the perceived artistic phase a person is going through. For example, I feel that it's important for me to work on lots of projects and publish eagerly just because that's where I need practice and development - my weaknesses as an artist are in my workflow and publishing skills, not education or inspiration; I need to learn to write with a more consistent speed, arrange my life around my working hours and so on. Therefore I choose to work on projects that develop these skills, to further my career as an artist. Other indie publishers will have different perceived needs of self-development and publishing, so they choose different projects to push. For me it makes perfect sense to spend several hundred hours on making a new edition of the Solar System, as that gives me valuable experience in writing under a deadline, which then synergizes with whatever I'm going to do later on in my life.<br/><br/>Anyway, it seems to me that this is a very personal-type thing, I don't think that you're going to find too many common threads between people in this issue. Looking at my own set of motivations, they're a pretty special case (as you already said). Others probably have just as consistently unique mixtures of issues going into why they not only design games, but also publish them. It'd be pretty interesting to try to group the different motivational arrays into rough family relationship groups, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147830/#Comment_147830" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T21:06:02+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  9:06PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Berengad Games' net profit for 2007, after selling 250+ copies of Beast Hunters: $262.

For that it needed art, especially the tattoos. As a Gamist (challenge-focused) design, the rewards play a big role in the play dynamics. Having actual custom tattoo designs that the player can see, earn, and imagine on their character is not just an afterthought, but an integral part of the design.<br/><br/>It also costs money.<br/><br/>So, publishing in order to make that money back. Which we've almost done by now.<br/><br/>Anima Prime doesn't need that, hence Creative Commons and me basically giving the whole game away for free for now.

The monetary returns are reasonable and indeed, as Jason says, if things go to plan there's a chance that Duty &amp; Honour could subsidise me attending GCUS next year. However, when you consider the effort thats gone into it so far, its hardly a great ROI for me. It could be that I want to have my ego stroked and of course, that means I could be a delusional fool as the likelihood of that happening is pretty slim.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end I'm pretty certain its because I like my game. I enjoy my game. I actually want to play and run my game and you know what? I know other people that feel the same way too. Thats a very special feeling and I like it a lot. I want to share my game with other people, in a format that they will be familiar with.

I've got several games that are going to be available as free PDFs and at-cost print versions from Lulu.  I'm also distributing free print ashcans of <i>Geiger Counter</i> at GenCon, through a promotion with the Design Matters booth.  I don't want to have to treat my hobby like it's a small business; that just kills all the fun for me.<br/><br/>But I'm still publishing because, with the tools at our disposal nowadays, there's literally <i>no reason not to</i>.  There are plenty of reasons not to put out a "finished" hundred-page full-color hardcover edition of something, at least not until you've spent several years preparing the thing, but with PDFs and cheap print ashcans instantly available (you don't even have to store them, they can exist as electrons until someone wants one from Lulu), sharing your work is quickly becoming the rule, not the exception.<br/><br/>Publishing doesn't mean just getting your book into game stores anymore.  It means every step along the way.  Release a basic outline on a blog or forum.  Release a playtest version as a free PDF.  Release an ashcan (what other folks call an Alpha or Beta version) in a print format for a few dollars.  Playtest the hell out of it.  Maybe release multiple playtest versions over a few years.  Finally, put together a final version.  Time is on our side.  There are no corporate folks giving us deadlines.  We can afford to take things slow, writing games like some folks write novels, taking 10 years even, not being Stephen King, especially if we want them to stand the test of time and not count on later editions to clean things up.  These are games that, supposedly, will keep being played whether they're still "supported" by further publications or not.<br/><br/>But -- and this is something we don't talk about much -- it's totally okay to release short games or ashcans that you don't necessarily expect to go all the way with (Ben's <i>XXXXtreme Street Luge</i> is a great recent example).  We shouldn't expect that everyone wants to be a small-time business person or, at least, that they want to follow that model for every publishing project.  Maybe they just want to put together a product solid enough that they can play it with their own play group and a handful of other interested folks can play it too.  That's totally cool.  I'm totally down with products that aren't really commercial in the sense that they're not aimed at a wider public audience.  Publish a game for 10-25 people, or for 5 people, or for 1 person.  That's publishing. Follow your passion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147957/#Comment_147957" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T06:14:29+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  6:14AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like having a creative outlet that pays for itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148012/#Comment_148012" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T08:33:06+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  8:33AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2008 8:33AM by Matt Snyder.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy Shit!
