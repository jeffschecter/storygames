                    I've just finished the latest iteration of <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/City%20of%20Masks%20Storygame%20Revised%202.pdf" rel="nofollow">City of Masks</a>, revised in line with feedback from Mendel and his friends, who were kind enough to playtest it for me.<br/><br/>It's now more of a gamey-game. In fact, it has aspects of Risk (secret objectives) and Settlers of Catan (even if you're not the person who brings the game to an end, you may get points for your other achievements). It's designed for pick-up play (pregen, randomly selected characters) and is both highly competitive and also collaborative. In fact, it's a bit like a TonyLB game, which given how much I've been enjoying the threads he starts is not a big surprise.<br/><br/>"In Bonvidaeo, the City of Masks, the mask you wear is who you are - or so everyone tells you. Young nobles just beginning to discover your identity, as you come of age you are thrust suddenly into the scheming and maneuvering of the powerful factions within the City. You must strive to make alliances and increase your Face, the social currency which buys you power and influence and protects you from being dragged down in the faction fights. All the time, though, your hidden face (your true personality) is coming clearer - conflicting with your maskâ€¦"<br/><br/>One of the points-scoring things is transcending your mask and getting to be who you are.<br/><br/>It has domino-based resolution, and you now get to wear actual masks while you play it (if you want to). <br/><br/>I'd love to get more feedback on inconsistencies, inelegancies, and things that seem awkward, unclear or overcomplicated in the text. If anyone else would like to playtest it, that would be <i>very cool</i>, and I'll swap you some proofreading if you want.                </div>

Ooh, I'd like to know more about both of these. Especially the mask bit! How does that impact the game?

That sounds like a neat format. Is it 50/50 novel/storygame, or mostly novel? I look forward to seeing it.                        </div>

Ooh, I'd like to know more about both of these. Especially the mask bit! How does that impact the game?<br/><br/><br/>I don't know yet, until it gets re-playtested. A bit of background: the game setting is a city where everyone wears masks, and whatever mask they are wearing at a given time indicates how they should act and how they should be treated. So if you are masked as Ispo the Poet, for example, you should be brooding and distracted and laugh hollowly if at all, but if you are masked as the Slapstick Clown you should cavort and caper and sing comic songs - and the same person can wear both of those masks at different times. A playing card draw gives you your initial mask (you can get additional ones during play), and originally having the card face-up in front of you was the indication of which mask your character was currently wearing, but the first playtest demonstrated that this was too easy to miss. Hence, wearing actual masks (or hats, if you prefer).<br/><br/>The dominoes, you draw one by one end, and look at the difference between the ends, and that helps to decide what happens. It's probably easiest if you look at the <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/City%20of%20Masks%20Storygame%20Revised%202.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF</a> (it's only 28 pages). About pages 14-15.

It's mostly novel, about 5/8; the novel came first. I don't know whether putting the storygame in the back will harm my chances with a mainstream publisher or not, but hey, you have to try.

At the moment I'm not sure if there are more Bonvidaeo stories, though I suspect there might be. I can kind of see something vaguely with pirates.                        </div>
