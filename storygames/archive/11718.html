Obviously taking a crack at the Great Pendragon Campain means characters will get old and almost certainly die (I suppose there are ways within the Arthurian Mythos for character to survive into their hundreds, but it's not likely). Most players will probably go through 3 characters at minimum. CF doesn't have any rules for growing old, and treats characters of any age as equal, mechanically. Here's what I'm thinking of:<br/><br/>When a PC takes an Injury, it heals one rank per year, rather than the written rate. If the player wishes, he can take an extra Aspect at the same rank as the Injury, but that makes the Injury permanent at that rank. At the end of each year, each player rolls all of their Permanent Injury dice. Each die that comes up  4+ gives them a +1 Age Modifier. They then roll all of the dice they have for any Aspects they may have that might increase their longevity (Healthy Lands, Great Constitution; anything of that nature). Each one of these dice that comes up 4+ reduces their Age Modifier by 1. Then, their character's age adds an Age Modifier as well: 21-25: -1; 26-30: 0; 31-35: +1; 36-40: +2; 41-45: +3; 46-50: +4; 51 or more: +5<br/><br/>Once the final Age Modifier is tallied, the player rolls a single die as follows:<br/>Age Modifier<br/>0 or less: No Roll Required<br/>1: d4<br/>2: d6<br/>3: d8<br/>4: d10<br/>5: d12<br/><br/>If the die comes up 4 or higher, then the PC takes a "Dying" Aspect at d4, which acts as a Penalty. If they already have "Dying", then it goes up to d6, and so on up to d12. A player of a dying PC can choose to have the PC die at any time, either in bed or if injured in battle.<br/><br/>Thoughts? Comments? Is this too harsh? Not harsh enough? Too crunchy?<br/><br/>What I like about it is that it gives the players the option to get into trouble (by rewarding them for taking Permanent Injuries), adds potentially serious -- but not insurmountable -- penalties (Dying d12 characters can still be awesome with the right luck and circumstance), and lets the players the option to get out of their penalties at any time by letting their character die an appropriate death and replacing them with the next generation.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>-AD.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261413/#Comment_261413" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T07:41:50+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  7:41AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like this. It runs parallel to the thoughts I've had so far about adding generational play to Chronica in the lordship rules supplement (that age is represented by an aspect rather than, say, by penalizing skills).<br/><br/>It seems a little crunchy right in the middle. What if your <i>Dying</i> aspect was your Age Modifier Die? Instead of consulting the chart, what if after the first time you've made an injury permanent you automatically get <i>Dying</i> at d4. Then after every subsequent year you've made an injury permanent, you have to roll your <i>Dying</i> aspect to see if it increases a step?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261742/#Comment_261742" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T16:14:34+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  4:14PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2010 4:16PM by deadlytoque.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jeremy Keller</cite>What if your<i>Dying</i>aspect was your Age Modifier Die?

And from the man himself! Done.<br/><br/>I particularly like how in your version, the age of the character doesn't matter.

Give everyone a die called, I dunno, Zeal or Vitality, or something, and it starts at d12. Then every year, roll it, and if it hits its max number, it decreases by a die type, until if it's a d4, and it hits 4, you are "dying" and can take your exit scene when appropriate. Alternately, you can skip right to having Dying if you take a permanent injury. That should give the characters a lifespan of something like 41 years (if they start at 21; I think this is right, math is not one of my strengths), which seems about right for heroic/medieval fiction, but if a player is lucky, it could allow for... well, theoretically infinite life, I guess, but more probably characters living into their 60s.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller" title="Jeremy Keller"><img alt="Jeremy Keller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jeremykeller.com/images/me_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeremy%20Keller">Jeremy Keller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262093/#Comment_262093" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T14:29:51+00:00" title="March 15, 2010  2:29PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From a pure dice mechanics perspective, I like this a lot better. <br/><br/>But I'm not sure now this is supposed to affect your character in play other than telling you when it's time for her or him to die.
