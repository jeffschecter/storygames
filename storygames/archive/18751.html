I've been lurking this forum for a while but haven't yet managed to post until now. I've recently been working on a role-playing game and I wanted to know what you all thought of it. It's still a work in progress and it seems like it might be a bit more complicated than a number of other projects on this website but I'm really confident that it's a lot of fun. It's called Monster Trainer, and it gives you all the tools to play out an awesome adventure in which you play an adolescent who bonds with magical creatures, a la Pokemon, Digimon, Monster Rancher, etc. It started out as a quest to play Pokemon in tabletop form without having to deal with the overly-complicated rules headaches of Pokemon: Tabletop Adventures but it quickly morphed into an entirely new thing altogether. My co-author and I ended up writing down a huge original bestiary and we're working on filling it with even more fluff. We're also starting to try to get a couple illustrations made since having an image or two helps when you're trying to picture fictional monsters. <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/lgtt1171iu0ugke/MonsterTrainer0.4.2public.pdf" rel="nofollow">Here's the link to download it</a> if you wanna check it out. I'd love to hear what you all think of it and I'll be adding lots on to it soon!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420690/#Comment_420690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-25T15:33:53+00:00" title="August 25, 2013  3:33PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2013 3:34PM by catty_big.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fun!
