Coming to <i>Anima Prime</i> from a lifetime of watching Japanese animation, I'm picturing something like in <i>Hokuto no Ken</i> (<i>Fist of the North Star</i>): all of the fighting, dodging, blocking, kicking, punching, hitting at pressure-points, stabbing and slashing is Maneuvers. Then, as soon as the dust settles, it comes a moment when your opponent realizes (s)he's been hit \u2014 and <i>that's</i> when you roll for the Strike: on a good enough roll, KABOOM!<br/>Or, you know all of those chambara anime &amp; movies, celebrating "samurai" lore and the awesomeness of Japanese sabres? The swordsman slashes at someone or something (Maneuver), then there's a moment of stillness, a dramatic break, probably a drum beat \u2014 only then, the person-or-item hit falls into two perfectly symmetrical halves. In my own <i>Anima Prime</i> games, the drum beat is the sound of dice rolling a Strike.<br/><br/>For the different sorts of actions you have in an <i>Anima Prime</i> conflict, I usually find it extremely useful to point at <i>when you talk</i> relative to <i>when you roll dice</i>.<br/><b>Maneuver</b>: describe all of the action, then roll. Any fictional Effect is purely under your control (just as much as Intent, Initiation and Execution) and strictly divorced from the mechanical Effect. All Maneuvers are awesome (though some are awesomer than other): you can't "roll poorly" for a Maneuver, or rather, even if you get a lousy roll in the end it doesn't make your actions (which you already described) any less awesome.<br/><b>Strike</b>: roll first, then describe what happens accordingly. You don't need to start from your attempt at hitting your opponent, 'cause you already narrated that on your last Maneuver action. You roll to determine whether the opponent's hurt, and how severely, then narrate their wounding accordingly. Don't even start talking before you've rolled and discovered how hurt they'll be.<br/><b>Achievement</b>: talk, then roll, then talk some more. Here we have a classic Fortune-in-the-Middle case: you begin with stating what you want to achieve and describing what you're doing to achieve that (Intent, Initiation and, optionally, Execution), then you roll dice to determine how effective you are, and conclude your narration accordingly. II*EE or IIE*E, depending on how far you go before rolling.<br/>I do enforce this procedural distinction quite categorically when I'm GMing AP, and of course teach it by example. Maneuver is talk-then-roll, Strike is roll-then-talk, Achievement is talk-roll-talk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427987/#Comment_427987" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-05T06:54:12+00:00" title="February  5, 2014  6:54AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff, folks. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>CarpeGuitarrem, horn_head_o; it is interesting to see that your interpretation is different than Rafu's. I think both could very well be acceptable approaches.<br/><br/>Rafu, thanks for that break down. Structuring where the narrative should be is pretty important, I think. I don't seem to recall that being a thing in AP's rules.\n<blockquote>I'd be interested in seeing how you narrowed the fictional meaning of Maneuver.

Since writing it a while back, I started to think about the disconnect between Maneuvers and Strikes in the fiction. Unless I have been terribly mistaken... You could describe trading blows with one foe, then on your next action roll the strike dice generated against a different foe completely and still be a "legal" move as the text never strictly forbids this.<br/><br/>This is my proposed change.<br/><br/>When performing the Maneuver action choose your target (Enemy, Hazard, Goal), describe the beginning of your action and roll. Each successful die <b>places</b> one Strike on the target while 6s do this and also generate 1 charge for you to hold. Describe the effect of your action.<br/>When performing a Strike action choose your target (Enemy, Hazard, Goal) and roll a number of dice equal to the Strike on that target. Successful dice deal damage and remove a point of Strike while unsuccessful dice deal no damage and remain on the target. Describe the results of your action.<br/><br/>(There are some details missing here but they shouldn't be important to the discussion. Also, in Pocket AP there are only Maneuvers and Strikes.

The most interesting thing about it to me is that it mechanically encourages ganging up on a guy; you have to get rid of everyone eventually, but better to remove threats one at a time rather than spreading your damage out and having more guys around to hit you back each round.<br/>Of course, that's also mechanically optimal in Anima Prime as well when you're actually Striking, but in the meantime you can describe all the cool things you're doing against the other elements of the battle.<br/>Unlike in basic Anima Prime, your thing actually allows for a mechanical way for people to set the baddie up for cool team attacks rather than a bunch of awesome solo fighters.<br/><br/>The other thing that concerns me is some action types - maneuvers now need to be targeted. At least in my eyes, in basic Anima Prime, Maneuvers are about charging up (mechanically at least). When I play Goku and start yelling and glowing and in a minute I plan to shoot out a giant laser beam from my hands, I can wait to call my target - it would be weird to designate a target already.<br/><br/>Here's an idea: would it be absolutely absurd to allow, when choosing a target while Maneuvering, to pick <i>yourself</i>, building up a Strike pool more or less like usual? Targetting appropriate to the action (so there's still something of a connect to the fiction), but still permitting those actions. And the same number of Strike dice are moving around - ganging up on a guy is more or less equally effective whether they have a lot of individuals hitting them separately or one person hitting super hard after softening them up.<br/>Of course, maybe the interest in doing stuff like that is just me, or that sort of pumping-up-myself move is just part of a maneuver and I should keep narrating until I have a target. Or you're just less interested in self-improving Maneuvers for your game.

Everything else I wrote is just reverse-engineered from there.<br/><br/>But getting back to business\u2026<br/><br/>"Placing strike dice on an opponent" sounds like a really cool thing. If I were you, I'd deliberately mess with the charge/strike dice economy so that each charge die is worth just as much as a strike dice. AP currently works so that earning dice in your charge rather than strike pool is a random thing: 6s to charge, 3-5s to strike. What I would want in the alternative system is: for each "successful" dice, it's the player's choice whether to put it into charge or strike. Strike dice get piled onto opponents, but you still charge up with charge dice yourself. This way, you can do both "fight the opponent" maneuvers and "charge up with energy" maneuvers, as well as in-betweens, and allocate dice according to what you narrate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Volsung" title="Volsung"><img alt="Volsung" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Volsung">Volsung</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428056/#Comment_428056" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T03:26:40+00:00" title="February  6, 2014  3:26AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crazy excitment!

Goals with a decisive impact on the game, such as making a former teammate see the errors of his ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428065/#Comment_428065" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-06T08:51:29+00:00" title="February  6, 2014  8:51AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Volsung, I'm not really worried much about table space and organization. But yeah, I've been doubting the strike placement system ever since I thought of it. My hope was that once the community answered my question related to maneuvers and strikes within the fiction that I wouldn't need the new mechanic.<br/><br/>I'm slowly making peace with the original system. But I still want to give the strike placement system a shot in actual play to see how it plays out.\n<blockquote>"Placing strike dice on an opponent" sounds like a really cool thing. If I were you, I'd deliberately mess with the charge/strike dice economy so that each charge die is worth just as much as a strike dice. AP currently works so that earning dice in your charge rather than strike pool is a random thing: 6s to charge, 3-5s to strike. What I would want in the alternative system is: for each "successful" dice, it's the player's choice whether to put it into charge or strike. Strike dice get piled onto opponents, but you still charge up with charge dice yourself. This way, you can do both "fight the opponent" maneuvers and "charge up with energy" maneuvers, as well as in-betweens, and allocate dice according to what you narrate.</blockquote>That is pretty brilliant! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I'll add that to the text immediately. This ties well into the fact that players can spend charge one-for-one to get strike dice. (though that is clearly a poor use of charge when one can spend it on awesome abilities)<br/><br/>Now all I need is a willing playtest group! :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
