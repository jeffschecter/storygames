The system I use: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Super_Heroes_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">Marvel Super Heroes</a>, aka FASERIP.  In the past I've created templates for Jason Bourne, Indiana Jones and others.  And you know what?  They came out pretty darned good.<br/><br/>I started thinking about statting out a couple of adventure heroes \u2014 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Bolan" rel="nofollow">Mack Bolan</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Fisher" rel="nofollow">Sam Fisher</a> \u2014 and though I recently bought <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=78447" rel="nofollow">Dogs of W*A*R</a>, which would seem to cover that kind of character well, I returned to FASERIP because it's just so easy to use.<br/><br/>Beyond just making characters with it, FASERIP functions well as a universal system, able to scale well from Aunt May to Galactus and applicable to pretty much any situation players would come up with and <i>simply</i>.  Which may very well make FASERIP the best generic ruleset I've ever used.  Certainly it requires a lot less heavy lifting than something like GURPS or the HERO System.<br/><br/>I'm not the only one who admires FASERIP for its utility.

As you say, it scales really well to simulate the range of power levels.  I haven't found that it works well as is for human level conflict, because that is expressed by a very narrow range.

It <i>covers</i> the range of power levels, but I'm not sure it <i>scales</i> to the range of power levels. Regular humans face crippling rates of failure while god-like beings have awesome rates of success. This isn't so much of a problem in systems where the GM sets a target number. But in FASERIP, there (usually) are no target numbers.* You can give row shift bonuses or penalties, but that's an extra hurdle to figure out and calculating the changing odds is not easy.<br/>\n<br/>\n[* After I posted this, I realised that's not the case. The GM sets the difficulty of the action, which sets the colour required to succeed. Can someone more expert in the system explain if this means if the difficulty is yellow ('ridiculous' difficulty) all successes are major successes?]<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you might argue that superheroes are supposed to succeed at everything and regular folk are supposed to fail quite often. That's all very well when supers face other supers with similar stats. However, supers excel in some areas and not at others - having very low scores in some attributes and very high ones in others. At the mid-ranges, this shouldn't be too pronounced but at the high range that can mean incredible vulnerability or nigh-invincibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also don't like checking a table. It slows the game down and breaks the focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have problems with the implementation, which would probably be easier to smooth out:<br/>\n[ulist]<br/>\n[*]No real way to calculate appropriate threats.<br/>\n[*]Some powers are keyed off attributes, others are not<br/>\n[*]Powers are shonkily balanced or not at all<br/>\n[*]Only a random character generation system<br/>\n[*]Damage is erratic and arbitrary - for example, an energy attack does damage equal to its rank value but a sword attack does a fixed (and low) amount.<br/>\n[*]I don't think the attributes were well chosen - Melee AND Brawn, but only Coordination? Nor do Awareness or Willpower seem like particularly compelling attributes. If they were changed to Intuition and Charisma, I think that would better capture their range.<br/>\n[*]Sometimes, row shifts and rank shifts matter (which can be a change in rank value of 1 or 850) and sometimes rank value changes matter. That makes a huge difference.<br/>\n[/ulist]<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are my thoughts. I've played the game a few times and had fun, but I'm not a huge fan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ozbot" title="ozbot"><img alt="ozbot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/nCTCPKSKDL4Z7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ozbot">ozbot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257771/#Comment_257771" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T04:22:47+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  4:22AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's important to remember that the original FASERIP (Marvel TSR basic set) had its roots pretty firmly entrenched in the traditions of TSR's D&amp;D; of the time. I remember re-reading it after a long period away and having the sudden realization that "hey, this is a miniatures game!" For instance, the importance of turn order but a weak initiative system, the emphasis on range and the range ruler and counters, etc. The advanced set capitalized on the one area of difference-- the Karma system. Suddenly, FASERIP became something else entirely: a resource-based game that was actually quite 'narrativist' (I still don't know how to use that term, but I hope you get what I'm saying.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, it doesn't matter that there's no target number, there's shonky balance, etc. If you have the karma, you could succeed. Tie the use of karma to a narrative moment, and you got a proto-story game. Anyway, that's a liberal view of it, but I've often found that those that try to add 'crunch' to the system with their house rules actually lose a bit by trying to turn it into Champions or something. Whereas those that let the karma ebb and flow freely find it a pleasurable gaming experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure I can answer your specific questions since it's seems so based on the 4C 'conversion' that it's hard to translate. But I since I got a few spare minutes I can try:<br/>\nThere can be difficulties that mimic a target number kind of system-- you compare ranks and depending on the relative distance the task could be automatic, require a green/yellow/red result, or be impossible. This is before you use karma to modify your results, of course, so often 'if you narrate, it can be done.'<br/>\nDon't know about the power/attribute thing. Sometimes you could house rule that you use an attribute rank to hit but a power rank for damage. Is that what you mean? Other times the power supersedes the rank, like super-strength or something.<br/>\nPowers are not really "supposed" to be balanced in the original system. I think you are supposed to play it so that a power can only be used generically unless you purchase power stunts with karma. (Again, a proto-resource based system) If you were young like me you just ignored that because sometimes unbalanced powers didn't matter much.<br/>\nSome people think the random character generation is a feature, not a flaw. Most time, if you wanted to be serious, you just modeled a character on an existing pre-generated one anyway.<br/>\nDamage is indeed a wonky part of the system, since I hate math. Doubly wonky if you consider the unbalanced nature of armor and things. Still, you could always counter it with Martial Arts D (I think?) which could slam or stun regardless of armor, and helped prevent munchkining.<br/>\nI also think the lack of Charisma is a flaw. I think Marvel tried to mimic the thing with a Popularity stat, but that was ill defined and rarely a feature of the published adventures anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that's all for now! I just defended a system long out of print and made into a generic common license that a few people enjoy. I love my hobby!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257877/#Comment_257877" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T10:21:08+00:00" title="February 23, 2010 10:21AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one issue with Charisma in comic book adaptations is that there are so many visual ways for artists to get across charisma or the lack thereof that they are seen less as properties of the character and more as properties of the story.  Virtually all comic book characters have been both described and depicted as inspiring/compelling and not-so-much at various points in their careers. Often it depends whether they're in "their own book" or another character's! Not sure what that implies for us in gaming, but it's one thing I've thought about when looking at adaptations (and obviously I've been looking at them a long frickin time).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257891/#Comment_257891" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T11:58:32+00:00" title="February 23, 2010 11:58AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love FASERIP until it's time to roll the dice.<br/>\nAnd when it's time to spend karma on rolls, I hate FASERIP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257915/#Comment_257915" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T13:30:05+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  1:30PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2010 1:30PM by Nathan_H.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think having a basic stat like Fighting was pretty smart.<br>There's a couple other things they did right, but yeah...you'd need a really good group, one well versed in spandex guys punching other spandex guys, with probably a shitload of house rules, to make the game really work.  <br>Luckily(or unluckily)I had a maniacally gifted gm, and players willing to feed his ego...for at least awhile.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261177/#Comment_261177" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T09:11:01+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  9:11AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H.</cite>I think having a basic stat like Fighting was pretty smart.</blockquote>\nI agree with this.
