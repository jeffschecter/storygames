The players were myself, my friend Bob, and his fiance Andrea. We had roleplayed together before, especially Bob and myself, but not regularly together for some years. We played over a few hours after getting back from seeing Beowulf.<br/><br/>The tone of the game was "Funny" (as opposed to Melodramatic or Slice-of-Life).<br/><br/><strong>Character Rundown</strong><br/><br/>Me<br/><br/>Employee: Ted (Clueless Hotshot needing Technobedience)<br/>Trainee: Lance (Patronizing Creep needing Lust)<br/>Client: Sunshine Hills Preschool<br/>Troublemaker: Mrs. Love (Embarrassed Ghost from the Past toward Claire, Friendly Associate toward Marvin)<br/><br/>Andrea<br/><br/>Employee: Marvin (Bitter Nerd needing Treachery)<br/>Trainee: Claire (Earnest Noob needing Admiration)<br/>Client: Fuspas (haut Scandinavian architectural design firm, a contraction of "Future Space")<br/>Troublemaker: Ula (Forlorn Authority toward Arnold, Scheming Sex Object toward Philipe)<br/><br/>Bob<br/><br/>Employee: Philipe (Unsavory Hipster needing Slack)<br/>Trainee: Arnold (Irritating Genius needing Chaos)<br/>Client: Natural Juices Spa<br/>Troublemaker: Amandla (Needy VIP toward Ted, Hostile Nobody toward Lance)<br/><br/><strong>Gameplay</strong><br/><br/>So, I could go into a detailed account of each interaction, but Business Solutions is, a bit like The Shab al-Hiri Roach, a mechanically light game. Suffice it to say that the card mechanic worked well. There's a little more room for strategy than in the Roach, but still so much luck involved that if your character starts "losing," it's probably more rewarding to just try and go out in blaze of glory than turn yourself around. What it all came down to was that Claire had the most blame, and Marvin had the least. This created an interesting state where Andrea controlled both the character who was promoted to Assistant Manager, and the character who needed to be fired. We resolved this by letting her choose which character she wanted to play in the final scene, and who she wanted to play the other one.<br/><br/>Business Solutions is a highly structured game. During each business day, the same series of scenes happen in the same order. What's interesting is that several of these scenes do not actually resolve anything (mechanically). They're just free roleplay. Now, sometimes we found that these scenes weren't going anywhere, and we just had to call "scene" and move on. This is a real improv-ish gaming right here. To that end, it might be nice to see this made more explicit in the text. Players who aren't used to roleplaying scenes that don't end in a resolution mechanic and don't have a background in improv might get a little lost.<br/><br/>We also found that several of the employees and trainees we generated were kind of anti-social, which made slowed down some of the non-mechanical scenes. This may have simply been an issue with our roleplaying that night, or maybe we should have gone with the "Melodramatic" lists. I think the office comedy genre, with its reference points of The Office and Office Space and Dilbert lends itself to creating passive-aggressive anti-social characters, but it can be tricky to play characters like that in a game essentially about inter-character relationships. This is a fine line to walk, and it's something I want to explore further, or maybe see discussed in the rules.<br/><br/>In general, everybody really loved playing the troublemakers. We did notice a tendency for the character who was "in trouble" for the day to make their own trouble, rather than letting the troublemaker do so. This didn't really cause a big problem, but next time around, I want to focus more on letting the troublemaker define the nature of the trouble.<br/><br/>Overall, we had a good time playing Business Solutions. I think now that we're familiar with the structure of play, we could avoid some of the pitfalls we hit the first time. I also really want to try the "Melodramatic" version of the game. If you're an improv-style roleplayer, this is a game that can really sing for you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_111236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/111236/#Comment_111236" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-03T04:19:53+00:00" title="December  3, 2007  4:19AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Ben!  I'm glad you guys enjoyed Business Solutions.  <br/><br/>My biggest concern right now is the front-loading of resolution - you have a limited set of cards given to you at the beginning and don't have a whole lot of opportunities to make tactical decisions - the deterministic thing, which you mention, seems less than ideal here.  <br/><br/>Did anyone call tech support?  If so, under what circumstances, and with what outcome?  <br/><br/>Did Needs get called out in play?

The only uncomfortable thing was that since we were all playing for the first time, the very first thing we did after character creation was divvy up our cards, which more or less decided our fates right then and there (excepting calls to tech support). I mean, "high card wins" isn't the most difficult mechanic to get your head around, but still, there was a lot of staring at our cards, and then kind of a shrug and just assigning the cards wherever.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Did anyone call tech support?  If so, under what circumstances, and with what outcome?</blockquote>\nNo. I chalk this up to it being everybody's first time, and it was enough to just go through the scenes and do resolution. As for myself, I was often of the mind that "I'll sacrifice on the repair to win trouble" or vice versa. A random draw at the cost of one blame seems a little steep, because I'm only going to use it if I've got a really low card and figure that a random shot in the dark will give me better odds. Maybe if the call added to the blame pool for that job, instead of just applying to the caller (I could always dodge it with a joker and screw my buddy) or if it had a sort of double-or-nothing effect on the blame pool. Maybe it just forces the caller to take at least half the blame rounded up from the job?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Did Needs get called out in play?  Were some stronger than others?</blockquote>\nA few times. Bob and I were more comfortable with "fanmail" mechanics, and I don't think Andrea had ever played a game that used them. Chaos, Treachery and Slack all got called out at some point or another, although if I remember correctly, the roleplay they lead to tended to derail the scene more than help it, and calling out the Need just allowed us to move on. For example, the Slacking character basically removed himself from the repair job, preferring to just sit in the van, until Slacking was called out. The treacherous character tried to talk the client out of using BSI during the initial phone call until Treachery was called, and the scene, which required that the job be requested, could continue. Negativity and contrarianism is really hard to pull off in improv without killing the energy in a scene. Considering that this game doesn't allow mechanical conflict any old time a conflict comes up (I can't force a slacking techie to work), the contrarian needs can suck the momentum out of a scene. I wonder if they couldn't be replaced by needs that lend themselves more toward getting the player to take action or push themselves more into the scene.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Did good or bad repair diagnosis have a substantial impact on technician success or failure?  (That's actually an important random element but I can't get my mind around the degree of impact it has)</blockquote>\nNot really. It raised the stakes of failure, but other than calling tech support, which is just a shot in the dark, it's not like I can "try harder." I'd also note that since we employee and trainee must agree on how to divide the blame, we always ended up splitting it as evenly as possible (except the one time a joker showed up). The players don't really have a method to take revenge, so the only way to avoid blame is to try and win the repair job or hope for a joker.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>At what point was the game's outcome obvious, if any?</blockquote>\nWhen Claire was hit by a joker on a failed repair job, she took 6 blame, and that was pretty much it for her. We knew Claire was going to get fired. Andrea's other character had 0 blame, as did, I believe, one of Bob's. So we weren't sure who was going to make assistant manager until they drew cards for it at the All Hands.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Was Andrea's controlling both winning and losing characters problematic at a player level?  It's easy to fix but I wasn't sure if it would be.</blockquote>\nNot really. Since the rules don't mention how to handle the final roleplaying scene if this occurs, we had wondered if we had misunderstood how blame works, or something, but we just kind of rolled with it and had Andrea pick which character she wanted to play, and which player she wanted to play her other character. When I reviewed the rules later, I saw that we hadn't made a mistake, but the rules didn't mention how to handle that particular state.<br/><br/>Thanks again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112134/#Comment_112134" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T14:56:56+00:00" title="December  5, 2007  2:56PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ben,<br/><br/>Do you actually live in Minneapolis?<br/><br/><i>If yes...</i> we need to get you on the local list.<br/><br/><i>If no...</i> I'm curious/amused why you decided to set this in Minneapolis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112248/#Comment_112248" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T22:17:16+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 10:17PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My parents live in a suburb of Minneapolis, and I was home visiting for Thanksgiving, as was Bob, who brought his fiance with him.

I'm thinking hard about how to make the interactions more engaging, the resolution more meaningful and exciting, and the resource handling tense and compelling.  I think the way out of the problem you experienced with negative Needs is to attach some condition to their use - you have a goal associated with your need, and fulfilling it is at least tactically important, rather than some mushy thing you sort of do.
