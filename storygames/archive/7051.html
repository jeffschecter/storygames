It's a PS3 game that was announced yesterday. I've been keeping quiet about this project for way too long, so forgive me, but I've got to scream this from the rooftops and so forth. Details <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/53676" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Anyhow, to maybe give this thread a purpose of some kind, wouldn't it be hilarious/awesome if there was a 256-person story game? Or at least a Massive Story Game. Imagine an entire con where every single person was involved in the narration of an epic story, the War and Peace of story games. Like MAG, it would have to be organized meticulously into small groups that work towards the same goal.<br/><br/>I guess in a situation like that, documenting the experience of each 'cluster' of players would be crucial, in order to illuminate the impact that the players had on the overall narrative (and to establish the scope of said narrative, since each group of players would only be exposed to a small piece of it during gameplay)...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156845/#Comment_156845" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T07:30:32+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  7:30AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

Though I must say, the concept that you propose is an intriguing one, and would doubtless appeal to a very select group of individuals.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>If every group of six has some objective that can be quantified, 40 or 50 groups reporting in could give you data that could change the play landscape in some way.

Another possibility that had occurred to me was that you could also play in 'rounds'. For example, the way that Dulse is played, in a series of scenes that culminate in a revelation of some kind. What if each scene was played, recorded, forwarded, collated, and then fed back to everyone else? Imagine our game of Dulse after round one (the opening scene between Baltor and Arras). We note that Baltor is not the father, that Arras is suspicious of him, and that there's a sorceress causing complications. The next table over, four of the fractious nobles are playing, and two of them conspire to overthrow Arras. Next table over, three pirates and a witch-woman cast a spell on Dulse. After round one, all of this is gathered up by a small group of enabling GM-types, while the players grab a soda or hit the bathroom or whatever. Then, the major highlights are included in the round-two setup. "Okay, now it's Dulse and Arras. Dulse, you've been feeling extremely strange lately. Arras, you think that there's treachery afoot amidst your nobles. And yet, despite this distraction, you still have strong feelings (but what kind?) towards Dulse..."<br/><br/>I don't know, just rambling.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kobayashi</cite>In the french rpg COPS, players and GMs voted for the election of Los Angeles next mayor (by sending email to the editor IIRC).

That way, releases of small pieces of information can (gradually) change the entire situation of the game to something new and unexpected, all by chain reaction.<br/><br/>Basically, you break your Bangs up into multiple stages, individually inert, and then much of the fun of the game can occur without GM (or even staff) assistance, as people jiggle up against each other and occasionally explode.<br/><br/>Metaphorically, that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157060/#Comment_157060" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-16T20:53:20+00:00" title="July 16, 2008  8:53PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 16, 2008 9:09PM by Callan_S.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing I've noted about online gaming with a fair number of people, is that experience overwrites experience. No matter how much gore or blades or shiny graphics you have, memory is quickly overwritten. Because everyone just plays over and over. If you were to just play once then had to wait a week before playing again, you'd no doubt remember alot of the little scenes and situations. In effect, you'd actually remember a story.<br/><br/>But when you play over and over again, story is obliterated by sheer weight of sensory input.<br/><br/>This is kind of why people like their 'headshots' stats and 'bullets fired' stats and so on. Things they would never remember, but when they look at them, they have a sense of history. Of story.<br/><br/>I think games need to, and would benefit, from actual recording events more than that, and making reviews of those recordings actually a part of play (like perhaps after a review, an optional quiz on whether you or your buddy threw a grenade or used C4...answer right and you get some extra credits or something). Commercially, think of it this way - the more people remember the good times in a game, the more they think that game is good.

Playing in the Camarilla you are always up against restrictions in what you do. You say "I'll go to Y" and the response is, oh that's someone else's plot, you need to send a report, wait for a response, get permission ... it's very restrictive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_157214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157214/#Comment_157214" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-17T13:11:17+00:00" title="July 17, 2008  1:11PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The overall player base for NERO is well over 1000, as is The Camarilla. The old days of Killer on campus could get into the hundreds easily; and there's at least two and maybe four 100+ per monthly event LARPs within the North Carolina borders.<br/><br/>As for 1000-player EVENTS in the US (southern)... not so far--the Norwegians and English (and French?) got us beat hands down on massive gaming. However, the LARP Cruise might hit those numbers, if not all in the same storyline/genre:<br/><a href="http://www.gameradventures.com/larp_carribian.htm" rel="nofollow">Gamer Adventures</a><br/><br/>But I know Raf means "nar/indie/dirty-hippie game" when he says "story game", not any old RPG (which is what it means, per Clinton's coining), with (or without) any resolution system. As opposed to "traditional" game styles, like NERO (boffer, full speed combat and projectiles) or The Cam (step-lock, round by round resolution).<br/><br/>I think massive NARisnness would only really happen either in an ARG (alternate reality game) or on some kind of fic forum like Skotos. It's a population-coordination and -communication thing (logistics aside; just talking game play). The fact that NAR sort of demands a lot of player authority and a clear communication of the SIS exacerbates common problems in less NARish games that want to disseminate "plot."<br/><br/>Get 1000 people in four major State Park campsites and you still won't get NAR without them all being HIGHLY coordinated--like, come check in at the Game Desk every hour, on the hour-sort of thing. Or radios. Or something.<br/><br/>Hehe... I wonder if I could get a Titanic LARP running on that LARP Cruise, or would it be in bad taste (yes, I am seriously considering attending--$400 is chicken scratch; even accounting for airfare, that's a CHEAP week's vacation).<br/>-----<br/>Anyone seriously interested in LARPing really ought to go to the RPG.net LARP Forum. We have a close, albeit small (relative to RPG Open) community; and we are WAY more serious and commited to design/coordination/helping each other out than shit storms (usually--a few of us can become... vehement.. at times, but what else is now?). I promise you'll be enlightened (judging by the rather-basic line of questioning here) and welcome to contribute NARdly notions and Nordic questions (quite a few of 'em post regularly, as do Swiss, English, and Parts further afield).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
