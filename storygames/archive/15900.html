We're thinking about doing a game where humanity essentially killed the gods and the remains of the gods settled across the universe. The players would have essentially godlike power and would be tasked with cleaning up the remnants (powerful monsters) of the previous gods. It seems like something that might fit the game, but I can't really find anything about the games, and I don't know if it's any good. Or, would this be something better fit for something like Nobilis?<br/><br/>Personally, I wouldn't mind doing something free-form, but I am playing with a group that comes from more structured play environment.<br/><br/>Are there any other games that you have found work well for doing post-human style storytelling?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361189/#Comment_361189" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T15:05:12+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  3:05PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The PDF was kinda long, so I haven't been able to really crack into it yet as much as other games I have. Currently waiting on my copy of the book, which should ship in not too long. I'm not sure the status of the card decks, though.<br/><br/>It sounds like in concept your idea gels with the Mystic Empryean setting. <br/><br/>There are folks who read through the book, helped spot errata, and have solid play advice currently on RPGNet. For me, it'll be at least a few more weeks (book and cards in hand) before I'll be playing it, unless a friend runs it from PDF from their tablet.<br/><br/>I have high expectations, though: The setting was something I was really excited by, and the system seemed really cool as well (via the Kickstarter).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361198/#Comment_361198" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T15:28:37+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  3:28PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback, Andy.
