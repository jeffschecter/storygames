Something that keeps enough of the original <i>feel</i> to draw oWoD players, but is solidly based in the Apocalypse Engine.<br/><br/>The simplest and minimal effort "conversion" would be simply replacing the resolution mechanic with the 10+, 7-9, and 6- from PBTA for any actions and use some basic dice pool to bonus conversion formula, like say: dice pool / 3 (round down). So a oWoD dice pool of 1-2 would be +0, 3-5 would be a +1, a 6-8 would be a +2, a 9-10 dice pool would be a +3. That of course has a lot of implications to the oWoD systems, merits, flaws, difficulties, etc. that might not be obvious at first. That might not matter to some, but it could be very important to others. It could work, I guess, but it would probably be easier just to use the originals as written.<br/><br/>The thematic conversion is the approach I think would work best. Take the basic concepts and build a PBTA game around that. But then you get into questions of what's important and how much the original oWoD rules inform the game.<br/><br/>The life-cycle of most oWoD player characters is fairly simple to pull out of the various games. The <b>supernatural thing</b> must <b>gather energy</b> and store it for later use to <b>fuel their supernatural powers</b>. There were various ways to gather that energy, ranging from benign to harmful to deadly.<br/><br/>Most oWoD supernatural things also seem to be <b>doomed</b> in some way. They gain or lose points indicating how close to succumbing to the negative side of their supernatural nature. Humanity, Banality, Paradox, etc. This is mostly tied directly into using their powers. Something like failing a "use powers" roll could inflict a doom point on the character. Get too many and your character is gone. So you'd also need an "avoid doom" move or mechanic to clear out those points.<br/><br/>The various splats/archetypes/races/classes were roughly equivalent across the lines. The Ass-Kicking Rebel. The Primal Outsider. The Crazy. The Secretive Ugly. The Artist. The Super In Touch With Their Powers One. The Haughty Leader. These are basically the same across most of the oWoD lines. Some are combined or subverted. In PBTA these are easy to see as playbooks. How many and how close to the originals vs broad archetypes is up in the air.<br/><br/>Though I do like the idea presented in Uncharted Worlds where you have two intersecting playbooks. You could do one as the creature type (vampire, werewolf, fairy, etc) and one as the archetype (haughty leader, the crazy, etc). <br/><br/>Coming up with the five stats most PBTA games use is really only a matter of picking names a la Simple World. You could make an argument for each line having their own evocative set of names, but considering the standardized set of stat in oWoD, probably not.<br/><br/>Basic moves are fairly simple. Between the various PBTA games there's enough to cover most, if not all, the things you'd be doing without bringing too many moves into play.<br/><br/>Advanced moves are also fairly simple. You'd need one move to gather energy (with a list to pick from that includes some version of "being gentle" so you could wrap the benign and harmful gathering of energy into a single move), one move to use your powers (which could result in doom), and one to avoid doom (reduce those doom points).<br/><br/>Random other elements like particular backgrounds, merits, flaws, etc could be handled with simple bonus moves (+1 when you X), stat swap moves (use X stat instead of Y stat when you Z), and narrative justification moves (now you can X). If they even need to be converted at all.<br/><br/>The only really non-obvious bit would be how in-depth to treat the various powers. Having 5-8+ major game lines, each with 10-20+ broad types of powers, and each of those broad types having anywhere from 5-20+ specific powers is a bit maddening to think about...<br/><br/>And that's where the hack gets so involved and complex that we'd loop back around to the same conclusion as the minimalist approach above, to wit, "It could work, I guess, but it would probably be easier just to use the originals as written."<br/><br/>Any thoughts, ideas, constructive feedback, etc are more than welcome and appreciated.<br/><br/>EDIT: Yes, I am aware of Monsterhearts, no it doesn't come close to doing what I want.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452305/#Comment_452305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T17:34:30+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  5:34PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you see the various other PbtA games which do this?<br/><br/>Games like Undying, Urban Shadows (I think?), etc?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452313/#Comment_452313" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-19T19:38:45+00:00" title="April 19, 2016  7:38PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2016 7:43PM by liblarva.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I have.

In overly generalized terms, Monsterhearts focuses on the angst, romance, and sex while Undying focuses on status, hunting, and loss of humanity. Vampire is both, plus more.<br/><br/>I'm hoping to cover a lot more ground than one specific thing.

Urban Shadows looks like it's got the politics covered. So that's one more 298 page game that does a goodly chunk of the oWoD games. Certainly worth lifting bits and several moves, especially the favors move. That's just great. <br/><br/>So is this one of the ways traditional "simulationist" games differ from more recent story games? The former are meant to be broadly applicable and let you do anything (and maybe fall into the trap of rules for everything), whereas the latter are so tightly focused that you can only really do one or two things well. <br/><br/>Seems like a bizarre trade-off though. Games like Dungeon World take 410 pages to do about 1/5 of what D&amp;D does in 1000 pages. No, that's not a slam on DW. It's a great game, and does what it's meant to do well. It just seems to take so many pages to do it though. I think that's mostly because of the "move" conceit. Instead of just presenting the rules it's gotta be formatted special so it eats up more room. <br/><br/>Maybe it's bits of my desire for slim story games fighting my mostly trad introduction to RPGs here, but it is just starting to strike me as bizarre that it takes so many really utterly specific moves to cover actions and interactions. I mean, I get that they're the PBTA equivalent to subsystems in other games, but they all seem like rather persnickety and almost trivially-minor variations on a theme. Why not just use one or a few broad moves, have a few in-genre edge case examples or whatnot, and be done with it?<br/><br/>Hell, almost makes me want to just go with the 10+, 7-9, 6- and dice pools divided by 3 (round down) thing above. Almost a best of both worlds. All the mechanics for all the things with the sleeker, quicker, and more fiction pushing resolution that is PBTA.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>, I doubt I could disagree more.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452335/#Comment_452335" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T04:30:46+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  4:30AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's hard to answer this (likely even for yourself) until you can nail down which parts of WoD are important for you, and which parts of PbtA are attractive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452340/#Comment_452340" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T06:48:20+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  6:48AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2016 6:50AM by liblarva.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that's fairly easy.<br/><br/>For PBTA it comes down to the resolution mechanic and the pick-up game style playbooks. But mostly the resolution mechanic. I like that it's player facing. That it's straightforward and universal (mostly). That there's no null result ("no") and that it pushes the fiction forward with every roll ("yes" "yes, but" "no, and"). But also that it's easy to interact with. There's no modifiers to target numbers, it's almost always just 10+, 7-9, 6-. That the bonuses are in a small range (-2 to +3 typically). <br/><br/>For WoD it comes down to the setting and the openness of the system despite the fact that I loathe a lot of the mechanics. Almost across the board the specific mechanics of how you do things in WoD can die in fire. The distinction I'm making between system and mechanics here is macro vs micro. The system is open. You can do anything your group and the GM wants, i.e. the game isn't micro-focused on delivering one exact play experience. It's "you're vampires in modern New York, here's a rough outline of local supernatural politics... what do you want to do?" (open), instead of "you're vampires in a monster high school and you each have a secret crush on another player and your teachers are the enemy... go" (focused). <br/><br/>The only other way I can think to describe it right now (it's late here), is the difference between a sandbox and a pre-planned adventure. WoD feels more like a sandbox, most story games feel like pre-planned adventures. It's "here's the rough setup, what do you want to do?" vs "here's what this game is all about, the mechanics are entirely focused here, what do you do in this tiny pre-defined space?"<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with either. I think I just want the open sandbox feel from the system with the specific mechanics to be innovative story game stuff.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452342/#Comment_452342" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T06:57:53+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  6:57AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything you are describing about the WoD will be fought against by the PBTA mechanics at every turn.

In PbtA, the "openness of the system", as you describe it, doesn't exist. I agree it's a huge part of WoD play, it's a really amazing strength of WoD!  But the PbtA system channels, quite powerfully, all player action into broad but predetermined courses, called "Moves". It's the fundamental mechanic of the game. There is no attempt on AW's part to be a generic post-apocalypse game; it doesn't even remotely function as one if you try to use it that way.  Monsterhearts, as you rightly note, doesn't function as a generic supernatural-creatures game, it's a teenaged supernatural romance game. Why? The Moves. There are no PbtA implementations worth talking about with generic Moves, though many have tried and failed.  The whole inertia of PbtA which is the structure of play doesn't even develop unless you're putting players into the log flume of some really solid, forward-moving Basic Moves that narrow character action into solid choices and consequences. It's important in WoD that maybe you don't have enough dice to throw at a situation and you need to think of another way forward. In PbtA, you just DO IT and the consequences of you not hitting your mark are the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452380/#Comment_452380" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T16:55:32+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  4:55PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be a contrary voice, liblarva, I think you might be conflating some of the play culture around these games with the games themselves. Games from the mainstream tradition liked to claim that they could be used to "do anything you want!", but, in reality, had just as limited a ruleset as any other game. Modern "indie" games tend to present themselves as a limited and focused experience, but, really, can be used very flexibly. <br/><br/>Now, I don't know if the correct hack for what you're trying to do already exists, but it's certainly possible to do so. What's Urban Shadows missing, for example?<br/><br/>JD may be right in that, depending on which features appeal to you specifically, PbtA might not be able to handle that in an elegant way. (These games collapse the power spectrum quite a great deal, compared to something like D&amp;D, as you saw in your D&amp;D/DW comparison, which is part of what gives them their strengths.)<br/><br/>But if it's just the 'sandbox' nature of WoD play that you're after (that's the only thing you've described so far), that's a mindset a group can bring to any of these games (or just about), including Monsterhearts. The mechanics might not fully support you in places, but I don't see how that's different from WoD. <i>(I'd be happy to be corrected on this point, though, since I've never actually played Vampire, but from what I've heard it's a fairly typical "trad" RPG in terms of its moving parts.)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452382/#Comment_452382" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T17:00:45+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  5:00PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although "sandbox" play (as I understand the term) wasn't explicitly supported by the corebooks of World of Darkness games, many of the supplements laid out material that was very sandboxy.

My experience has been the opposite: in, say, AW, your fictional situation is supposed to be flexible and changes can happen regularly. More structurally, you CAN take moves from other playbooks and even switch playbooks as your character develops, in pretty much any direction you want.<br/><br/>In most "trad games", including WoD, don't you start with a "class" or "clan", which limits not only what you are now but also what you'd be able to do in the future?<br/><br/>For example, a D&amp;D Fighter will become a more powerful fighter as the game goes on, and in very specific ways. Won't a WoD Vampire just become a more powerful Vampire, in the same way?<br/><br/>Whereas an AW could hypothetically go in all kinds of directions: a Gunlugger putting down his guns and becoming a Hocus, or an Angel becoming a Hardholder, or whatever else.<br/><br/>Last time I played AW my character transformed into a "messiah" within the first hour of play, and this was both supported and prompted by the rules as well as the players, much to everyone's surprise. I don't really see how that limits the possibility of "sandbox" play, or wide-open exploration in any other sense.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452398/#Comment_452398" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T19:07:23+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  7:07PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think you might be conflating some of the play culture around these games with the games themselves.... [they] had just as limited a ruleset as any other game.</blockquote>\nI might be conflating the two, but I doubt it. And that second bit is fairly obviously false. <br/><br/>DW has a fair amount of focused rules that point you in a particular direction, i.e. straight-up murder hobo dungeon crawl or similar in the city, forest, etc. D&amp;D covers that same ground, sure, but it also has rules for a lot of other things as well. The variety of actions the rules explicitly support in D&amp;D is far greater than the variety of actions the rules explicitly support in DW. And that's really what I'm talking about, variety of experience. <br/><br/>Sure, like any game system you can ignore chunks, house rules the hell out of it, and use the system to do anything you want. But that's missing the point. The game is still specifically designed to deliver a tightly focused play experience (DW) or it's specifically designed to deliver a variety of play experiences. Again, I'm not saying one is better or worse, just that I'm caught in the middle. I prefer the broader, more varied style games but I also prefer the more modern story game style mechanics. I don't think they're entirely mutually exclusive.\n<blockquote>What's Urban Shadows missing, for example?</blockquote>\nEverything that's not politicking and debt collection. Again, it's the distinction between broad but shallow systems vs narrow but in-depth systems. WoD was broad and shallow; Urban Shadows, from what I've read so far, is narrow but in-depth. Urban Shadows has a lot more specific systems for politicking and debts than WoD. But US lacks specific systems for much of anything outside that narrow focus. \n<blockquote>These games collapse the power spectrum quite a great deal, compared to something like D&amp;D, as you saw in your D&amp;D/DW comparison, which is part of what gives them their strengths.</blockquote>\nThe power spectrum doesn't interest me that much. I'd much rather start as a "hero" or established competent character rather than "earn" it through advancement. At least in regards to powers, strength, bonuses, etc. In game "advancement" such as making connections, establishing relationships with NPCs, etc are another matter completely. In-game mechanical advancement seems artificial to me most times, often creating the Christmas Tree effect, whereas in-game story advancement is much more organic and believable. \n<blockquote>The mechanics might not fully support you in places, but I don't see how that's different from WoD...</blockquote>\nIt's the scope of what's supported that's entirely the point. Just because neither covers <i>everything</i> doesn't somehow mean that Monsterhearts mechanically covers all the same ground as WoD. Clearly it doesn't. <br/><br/>To do anything outside the narrow focus of Monsterhearts you need to either use the bits of mechanics for unrelated things or invent mechanics to cover the new ground. It's certainly easy enough given that it's PBTA, but it's still repurposing or creating new rules to do other things. With Most trad games a goodly portion of the rules for doing those other things are already there. Sure, the trad games don't literally have a rule for everything, but they cover a whole hell of a lot more ground than focused story games. Or, if they don't specifically cover the thing you want, there's a broad framework for covering it, something like skills systems or similar.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452400/#Comment_452400" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-20T19:16:11+00:00" title="April 20, 2016  7:16PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I certainly agree that DW is more limited in scope than D&amp;D.

Plus all the usual games of a random group of PC vampires in a random cool town. You can do lots of stuff with it but it's not optimized for most modes of play.<br/><br/>In practice, the game rules don't provide a ton of support for specific kinds of story but a good GM with willing players can do a lot.<br/><br/>In most PbtA games, there's a specific mode of play, so Urban Shadows really shines at investigation, politicking and dirty business in an urban fantasy setting. Monsterhearts really shines at stories of twisted love and self-exploration. The mechanics and Moves reinforce this focus reasonably well. If you suddenly decided to tell a story about ice-cold urban politics with Monsterhearts, you could, but it would take more work and a lot of spitballing by the GM.<br/><br/>2) established vs dynamic game setting<br/>Vampire is famous for its incredibly detailed setting and "metaphor" ranging from prehistory to the future of the setting. This can be very cool, it makes a quick shorthand where I can pitch a game based on a Sabbat war pack or Anarchs during the fall of the Anarch Free State, and everyone knows what to expect and what kind of character to make. It has lots of downsides, too.<br/><br/>On the other hand, most or maybe all PbtA games require lots of input from players and even content explicitly generated by Moves. When a new NPC shows up, the GM can't really have everything planned out because this generated content can totally change them. The nature of the setting itself can take a while to get established with some setting elements getting changed or discarded after the first session.<br/><br/>I like playing both but find the coherent nature and player input make PbtA much easier to run as GM.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452489/#Comment_452489" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T01:39:26+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  1:39AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your notes on established game setting make sense, but I'm not sure what more can be said about that: either you go with a published game setting, make your own, or play in a more "dynamic" style (as you put it). Unless you're looking for an established game setting you're not currently aware of? (I don't know of any that haven't already been mentioned here.)<br/><br/>As for coherent and incoherent, here's what really confuses me when people talk about this kind of thing:<br/><br/>* Vampire is a traditional RPG, meaning we can have fun doing stuff which is not covered by the rules.<br/><br/>* Game X is a "coherent" game, which means we need to do stuff supported by the rules, and only that.<br/><br/>If in, say, Vampire, you can play awesome political intrigue (or whatever, maybe that's a bad example - I don't know) by ignoring certain rules, why couldn't you do the same in any other game?<br/><br/>What does Vampire actually provide here that is missing when you play, say, Urban Shadows? (If it's just a void of rules which allows you to freeform, it seems to me that wouldn't hard to "import" to any other game, after all... just cut out some rules!)<br/><br/>If you can figure out what it is, then you can answer your conundrum, I would think.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452494/#Comment_452494" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T08:24:28+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  8:24AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2016 8:25AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of agreeing with JDCorley, it seems to me that the thing you don't want out of PBtA -- i.e. thematic focus -- is in fact the exact thing that makes PBtA good. You could simply write great moves for every possible thing in a WoD Vampire game, if you wanted, but most likely there would be so many basic moves as to diminish the usefulness of the 'basic move' structure. And more importantly, your set of moves would have no thematic coherence, because, at least based on what you've said so far, the 'sandbox' you want is not an open setting -- which AW obviously does just fine -- but an open theme. Maybe it would be productive to figure out how to PBtA-ify Sorcerer's thematic setup procedure.<br/><br/>Alternately, you could just use a generic catch-all move for everything, a la World of Dungeons. So far the list of things you like about PBtA does not seem to really include any of the thematic coherence discussed above -- the sticking point is that the resolution mechanic in AW works so well not because those are nice numbers or even because 'yes, and' is the most genius framework of all the time, but because Vincent designed super propulsive, super coherent basic moves with very, very strong ideas about what sort of 'yes, and' is appropriate to the game.<br/><br/>So, as I said above, my feeling is you will mostly just be throwing out the baby with the bathwater, but even WITHOUT specific moves I will certainly agree that 6-, 7-9, 10+ on 2d6+stat is better than the WoD die system -- so maybe the World of Dungeons approach will get you closer to what you want, at least. And the acronym is even the same, so bonus. The obvious drawback is that you will have to invent thematic coherence and killer 'yes, and' results on the fly, nonstop, forever, until the game is over.<br/><br/>The other option is of course to just design a new version of the basic moves for every campaign, which is a frontloaded version of the above, and certainly would feel a lot like what it was like to run a WoD campaign back in the day.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452507/#Comment_452507" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T16:30:57+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  4:30PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ICE explains it better than I was trying to.  I happen to have a Chronicles of Darkness book close to hand since I'm running it tonight. It's not oWoD but I think I see what liblarva is getting at. There are 24 skills in Chronicles of Darkness, and 9 attributes - there are 216 die pools that can be constructed on every character sheet. A lot of them are nonsense that wouldn't make any sense in the game world, so let's cut it down to 100 viable die pools. That's before you add in supernatural abilities and special merits and flaws that give you particularized capabilities.  PBTA games boil down everything you could ever possibly do in their game into 5-10 Basic Moves (and the best games have a small number of Basic Moves) and 2-3 playbook moves (and the best games have a small number of playbook moves).  Why? Because the game is channeling your action into a fast-moving laser-focused stream of action and consequence.  <br/><br/>Another disconnect is that there's no need for determining Strength + Weaponry versus Strength + Melee versus Dexterity + Melee when you're attacking a guy in Apocalypse World, so there is no sense in determining how strong your character is, or how good they are at weaponry.  You have one idea and the GM may have another and the other players might have other ideas, but at no point do you ever, EVER determine, independently of attacking someone in a particular situation, your character's capability with weaponry. A miss in Urban Shadows' Unleash an Attack might even involve a devastating, effective attack - that's stymied only by the awesome coolness of the target.  Or you might have missed.  In World of Darkness games, I can buy a Merit called Contacts, representing my ability to get information from certain people. If I buy that, it's mine. I get to keep it and use it as I please. The GM can't take it away from me.  In Apocalypse World, a gang leader can lose their gang. A Hardholder's hold can be wiped out. Your character sheet isn't an accumulation of abilities that you deploy on the world, it's a snapshot of your inertia at this exact moment. You can get worse at dealing with vampires in Urban Shadows! You can't get worse at things in World of Darkness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452514/#Comment_452514" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T19:37:49+00:00" title="April 22, 2016  7:37PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree on issues of thematic focus.

OK, so there's more information on your sheet. Is that really somehow impossible in a PbtA context? Is it just about having more information about your character, including backstory, philosophy, possessions, etc?<br/><br/>I suppose what I would love to see is an example of something which WoD enables which really wouldn't work in a PbtA context. What does that look like?<br/><br/>(I'm not being obtuse or argumentative here, by the way. I'm honestly curious about poking the limits of this thing, and what lessons we can draw for the sake of adaptation. For instance, DW is fairly bland thematically, and, while that's not a draw for me, it at least shows the possibility of using a strong PbtA framework without too much thematic focus. I'd imagine a PbtA game with multiple thematic strains could also be manageable, if a bit bloated.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452527/#Comment_452527" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T22:34:46+00:00" title="April 22, 2016 10:34PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 22, 2016 10:38PM by liblarva.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>At the risk of agreeing with JDCorley, it seems to me that the thing you don't want out of PBtA -- i.e. thematic focus -- is in fact the exact thing that makes PBtA good.</blockquote>\nFor you perhaps, but not for me.

It's that there is no bull result from the dice that makes PBTA work so well. A thematically-focused list of GM moves to use when a 6- is rolled is great, but many moves are generic in themselves. They might have evocative names, but there's nothing inherently more amazing about "Barf forth Apocalyptica" when compared to "Spout Lore." Except the name. It is the fact that the resolution mechanic itself pushes the fiction forward that makes PBTA games good. The lack of "nothing" as a possible outcome when the dice hit the table. <br/><br/>And you could easily turn the hundreds of stat+skill combos in WoD into a small group of moves. Spout Lore and Assess Situation / Investigate cover most, if not all, the mental stats and knowledges. An attack move and an avoidance move cover most of the strength and dex + whatever comboes.<br/><br/>Considering that's roughly half the comboes in four moves, I don't think it would be that hard to replicate the broader, less focused style of WoD with PBTA. <br/><br/>One of the things I think lets PBTA condense things like this is that the mechanics are goal oriented. Most games tackle actions in basically two parts: the goal and what specifically the character does to achieve that goal. WoD mechanics are focused on the "what specifically" end of things, whilst PBTA focuses on the goal. In WoD it's "I shoot him." "Okay, roll dex + firearms." In PBTA it's "I shoot him." "Okay, roll attack with +dex." Or similar. Like superhero games with either laundry lists of powers or effects-based power construction. PBTA is an effects-based system. The mechanics focus on what your goal is rather than how you accomplish it. The fiction is the realm for how. <br/><br/>In looking at several PBTA games I'm also really loving the background and relationships questions. I think my favorite version so far is Masks: A New Generation.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452532/#Comment_452532" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-22T23:27:39+00:00" title="April 22, 2016 11:27PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Why is it important that you can't get worse at things in WoD?

The lack of "nothing" as a possible outcome when the dice hit the table.</blockquote>\nWell, IMHO this <i>isn't</i> strictly a feature of Apocalypse World, or PBTA games. This is just a classic feature of <b>conflict resolution</b> over task resolution, when done well. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>If you go back to granddaddy Sorcerer, that (confusing, hard to decipher, whatever) book, too, stresses that "nothing" isn't a possible outcome of going to the dice. This despite the dicing mechanism being <i>very</i> similar to WoD: a dice pool with a binary outcome of pass/fail or rather win/lose, plus flourishes such as the rare chance of a total/overwhelming success. So what?<br/>Here, the difference between Sorcerer (once you figure out how to play it, sure) and WoD is <i>when and why</i> you roll dice, not how. Like, in WoD you roll to check how well you perform a somewhat difficult action, whereas in Sorcerer you roll because we figured out there's a conflict of a sort going on: danger, urgency, whatever. The "no bull result" part isn't coded in the dice, sure, but it's part of identifying/framing a conflict as such \u2014 like, it's either you get to do what your want or someone else does, or some looming threat hits, but  a simple "nothing happens" is never ever at stake, or it wouldn't really be a conflict.<br/><br/>Of course, the above is more art than science: sometimes it's a tough call (is it a conflict or not?), sometimes you're hard pressed to find something interesting to say (how can this situation move forward on a success, and how can it move forward on a failure?)\xa0\u2014 and that's one reason why AW is so good. It made conflict resolution easy - so easy some people don't realize it's there, under the hood.<br/>Basic moves (and some character moves) codify possible conflicts as tropes: when X happens in the fiction, or character chooses to do Y, it's always a conflict, no questions asked. Roll these dice, and here's how it could move forward on a clear-cut hit, or on a mixed hit \u2014 on a miss, see the attached "how shit might go wrong" list for suggestions. This removed the entire "is this a conflict, and what's at stake?" table-talk from the game, resulting both in a leaner, faster game as well as in a somewhat more bloated rulebook than in more "classical" conflict-resolution type games.<br/>But my point is, you don't technically <i>need</i> to go as far as AW. What you're looking for might be a lower hanging fruit than you thought. So:\n<blockquote>The simplest and minimal effort "conversion" would be simply replacing the resolution mechanic with the 10+, 7-9, and 6- from PBTA for any actions and use some basic dice pool to bonus conversion formula, like say: dice pool / 3 (round down). So a oWoD dice pool of 1-2 would be +0, 3-5 would be a +1, a 6-8 would be a +2, a 9-10 dice pool would be a +3.</blockquote>\nI disagree. The minimum-effort conversion would be to retain WoD character sheets and dice pools and only change <i>when you roll the dice and what for</i>. If you switch from "roll because you're trying to accomplish something with your skills" to "roll because this is a conflict of sorts", you're clean of "nothing happens" results!

There are bits on the WoD text about auto-successes and when to roll, so that's certainly baked into the game, at least in the X20 line.

Though it needs a fair amount more. Keeping rolls for only those situations where something interesting happens with a success or failure helps. Adding GM moves for when players fail a roll helps. Even offering hard choices or consequences to turn a failure to a partial success would help. All of those would certainly push things in the right direction (for me and what I want to do). <br/><br/>However, it would require a substantial house rule / rewrite to make the combat system work that way. RAW WoD requires up to four rolls per attack. One to hit, one to dodge, one to damage, one to soak damage. So there are four opportunities to fail an attack and produce a null result.<br/><br/>You fail to hit, null. The target dodges, null. The attack does no damage, null. The target is so tough they soak the damage, null. <br/><br/>And that's done for every single attack. GM or player. This is another reason for going toward something like PBTA where it's one roll with the positive and negative combined, including the baddies hitting you instead of, or in addition to, you hitting them.<br/><br/>You could easily combine some of these. Have the difficulty / TN for the attacker's roll to hit be the defenders dodge dice pool (eliminating the dodge roll). All the successes generated are real damage (instead of potential damage, eliminating the damage roll). The target can then roll soak. Cutting the rolls in half.<br/><br/>You could make the player decide they can either dodge or soak. Though I doubt many WoD players would tolerate that. (Which goes against the second goal of the conversion, which is to get actual WoD players wanting to play the hack.)<br/><br/>You could make the rolls player facing. So the attack also determines their opponent's swing. So failures on the player's roll are successes for the NPC hitting back...<br/><br/>On and on...\n<blockquote>Is that all that's needed?</blockquote>\nNo. Because it would require a hack so cumbersome and sprawling that it's not worth the effort.

"don't fee the..."\n<blockquote>(Also, for the record, I'm pretty sure Vincent Baker would disagree with you about AW resolution not being conflict resolution...</blockquote>\nI'm sure he'd disagree with a lot of what people are saying about what is and is not AW in this thread. Doesn't seem to matter to anyone else, so...<br/><br/>Besides. One action, one bit of mechanics... that's task resolution. Bundling the entire conflict for the entire scene into one roll, that's conflict resolution. Because you're resolving the entire conflict with a roll, you know, as opposed to resolving one task. So yeah, PBTA is way on the side of task resolution.<br/><br/>(Yeah, you remember me mentioning those endless rabbit holes "helpful" posters bring into threads to prevent actual conversation, this is a perfect example...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452591/#Comment_452591" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-23T22:35:49+00:00" title="April 23, 2016 10:35PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2016 10:46PM by Stephen P.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of us consider task and conflict resolution to be something different than you've just described. <br/><br/>In short, they have little to do with the granularity or scope of individual roles, as you've said above. <br/><br/>Here's the beginning of a classic blog post from Vincent Baker on the topic: hardly the last word, but a common and basic starting place:\n<blockquote>In task resolution, what's at stake is the task itself. "I crack the safe!" "Why?" "Hopefully to get the dirt on the supervillain!" What's at stake is: do you crack the safe?<br/><br/>In conflict resolution, what's at stake is why you're doing the task. "I crack the safe!" "Why?" "Hopefully to get the dirt on the supervillain!" What's at stake is: do you get the dirt on the supervillain?<br/><br/>Which is important to the resolution rules: opening the safe, or getting the dirt? That's how you tell whether it's task resolution or conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Task resolution is succeed/fail. Conflict resolution is win/lose. You can succeed but lose, fail but win.</blockquote>\nThe short essay goes on to address exactly the issue of scope. <br/><br/><a href="http://lumpley.com/hardcore.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lumpley.com/hardcore.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452595/#Comment_452595" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-24T01:01:15+00:00" title="April 24, 2016  1:01AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, apparently the definition of "Conflict resolution" changed while I wasn't looking, or some of you people are using different definitions than mine. No biggie. I'm not here to act as the Forge Police or anything.<br/><br/>The only reason I brought it up is that I thought it useful. Specifically, I believe the writing/conversion effort (time, etc.) required to import (Sorcerer-style) conflict resolution into WoD, or any similar RPG from that era, is a lot less than what required for writing down all of the basic moves and playbooks etc. for a new, working AW-like game. Even when you account for rebuilding the combat subsystem from scratch (a much easier task than designing good basic moves). Hence the suggestion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452596/#Comment_452596" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-24T01:14:08+00:00" title="April 24, 2016  1:14AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2016 2:01AM by liblarva.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Most of us consider task and conflict resolution to be something different than you've just described...</blockquote>\nThat's great. It's kind of playing a shell game with the definitions of words though.<br/><br/>You're taking task resolution, ignoring the task, adding in the goal they're trying to achieve*, rolling to resolve whether they achieve the desired goal, then for some reason calling that conflict resolution. The confusion comes from taking a common word that means a thing, then using it in a different way, instead of, you know, using the word that actually means what's intended (it starts with a "g" and rhymes with "coal".)<br/><br/>(* Of course completely eliminating the possibility they could just want to achieve the task at hand, say cracking a safe just to see what's inside.)<br/><br/>By inference, there's only a limited number of goals characters in *World games can have as there are only a limited number of moves. If that's the case, how stupidly limited. Yeah, just the goal-based resolution mechanic from PBTA is looking better and better. <br/><br/>But whatever, you've got a nice rabbit hole here.

"Yep, makes sense... cool idea... cool idea... geez, so involved and complex that it'd probably be way easier to use the originals."<br/><br/>Personally, I'd give up on the playbooks and focus on two things: MC moves and roll conversions.<br/><br/>As a player, I'd be happy to have my standard Lasombra sheet and use Obtenebration just as it's defined in the book, but roll 2d6 for what happens.  If I'm using the power to do damage or act with force, then we use the outcome lists for Hack and Slash or Seize by Force or whatever the best match is from the PbtA basic moves you assemble.  My ranks in Obtenebration then translate to bonuses to the roll (maybe even 1-to-1 if it's a low-level game and you don't expect rank 4 powers before it ends).  I think we can keep WoD character creation as is.<br/><br/>And then if I roll badly on my shadow-morphing action, the MC/Storyteller gets to activate my hunger or have the shadow tentacles come for me, or tax my Blood pool extra, or whatever else you come up with for the Hard Moves list.<br/><br/>What do you think?

Like you say, the thing you're summoning goes off leash instead of following your commands, destroying the safe instead of finding the incriminating documents inside. Usually a simple reversal is enough.
