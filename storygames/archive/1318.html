                    At GenCon, Chris Chin had a funny story about the first edition of Exalted. Apparently, it described a system as a way to prevent bitterness and hostility between players. The assumption that such negative feelings existed between players at all times struck us as quite hilarious. He captured it perfectly when he said, "That's like Chess being a system to prevent knife fights between the two players."<br/><br/>So that begs the question: What if a system were made that aggravated existing tensions between the players even if there were none before? Here's the little idea, with many thanks to Shreyas for helping me kick it up a notch.<br/><br/><b>Get Out</b><br/><br/><i>Begin with any number of participants in a room. <br/><br/>All participants try to force each other to shout "GET OUT!" The person who shouts this must refer to themselves in the third person. So, if Melanie wants to leave, she has to shout, "GET OUT, MELANIE!" <br/><br/>Participants can force each other to say this through whatever means necessary short of physical violence. You can lie, cheat, insult, berate, betray and otherwise persecute whoever you wish until they finally break.<br/><br/>When someone says "I want out" you must immediately stop berating them and allow them to leave the room. Outcasts should wait around in the same area until the game is complete.<br/><br/>The game continues until there is only one person left in the room, who ironically ends up being the one who is most hated by the rest of the group.</i><br/><br/>Now, I'm not actually condoning this kind of behavior, especially among friends, but I was just curious about exploring the darker side of manipulating player behavior through system. Honestly, I feel kinda dirty. :P                </div>

                            Having slept on it, I feel bad for posting this idea in a forum where the opening splash page says "happy!" right there on the front, so here's a more positive (and slightly creepier) alteration:<br/><br/><i>Instead of insulting the person you want to leave, kill them with kindness. Compliment them, tell them how much you appreciate their presence in your life, tell them all the nice things you never get a chance to say anymore. When they say "Thank you," you must stop complimenting them and let them leave the room.</i><br/><br/>The weird twist about this is that whoever is the last person in the room is still kind of disliked by the rest of the group since they are either supremely narcissistic or can't take a compliment. :P<br/><br/>Obviously these aren't really story-games, and not even really games at all, more like psychological experiments. But as Shreyas says, we use system as an interface to interact with one another. Are there any other examples of controlling player-to-player interaction either directly or through emergent properties of a system?                        </div>

We had a forum game on rollespill.net called "The Big Fight". In the game, everyone played themselves, and the game was about a thread going down in flames. Everything was allowed.<br/>
<br/>
It was a mosh pit. If you got in, you had to take whatever was coming your way. Sometimes it was fun, a lot of the time it was great to finally ditch all the forum rules and say outrageous stuff. A few times I said something I kinda regretted the next day.<br/>
<br/>
The thread's still there; it's occasionally revived. No real enmity has come of it; the person I was afraid I'd insulted too badly is still my very good friend.                        </div>

                            the fact that in many groups there are social conflicts, dominance games, even the occasional seduction going on in game is not commonly acknowledged in the indie game scene (as it were). A lot of people felt that Ars Magica exacerbated tension in play-groups. I think a system of social conflict resolution will go a long way to eliminating this, as Exalted still does commonly.                        </div>

                            Is social conflict between gamers something that's beyond the scope of a game, though? It seems like there are some deeper issues there that ought to be addressed outside of game if the conflicting personalities are to play together. That is, unless the game itself is designed to resolve these matters either through direct or emergent behavioral control, which itself would be interesting.                        </div>

You see this in unstructured let's-pretend play with kids, and you see it in all other forms of intimacy (see the OgreCave podcast interview with ECB and CRN at Gen Con for some talk about roleplaying as an inherently intimate act). Exalted's only mistake was the belief that you could definitively prevent hostility with system, or at least with the system in Exalted.<br><br>[Edit: heh, I've just looped around through Jane McGonigal's blog to 10x10 Room.

                            Hey Mike,<br><br>Certainly those things can happen (and do happen, in certain kinds of -ugly- play), but when you put that as the defining features under "What is a Storytelling Game?"- basically, to non-gamers, what are you really saying?  I mean, would you really want to try out a boardgame if I introduce it and tell you how it's full of safety precautions to prevent you from losing fingers?<br/><br/>Selling your recreational activity on avoiding arguments, bitterness, and boredom is an amazingly low bar to hold your game to.                        </br></br></div>

                            My reverse engineering design uses setting creation as a method for getting the player characters on a footing where they'll be at odds with each other.

                            Chris: would you want to try out a motorcycle if it didn't come with brakes? You seem to be saying that bitterness and antipathy aren't present as risks in make-believe until a text puts them there. I'm saying they are, in spades. They are on the table because everything we are capable of as human beings is on the table. I think what we agree on is that telling people your system does something it doesn't do w.r.t. those ugly feelings will only amplify the ugliness.                        </div>

I'm saying if the <b>best thing</b> you can say about your bike is that it HAS working brakes,  and doesn't spontaneously explode for no reason, while good things, I have to ask why I should expect otherwise in the first place.

                            Chris, I finally figured out what bothers me about this (the Exalted quote).<br/><br/>Storytelling is about shared creativity, right?  I could be wrong, but I think lots of us have TERRIBLE associations of bitterness and resentment about sharing our creativity with other people, dating back way before roleplaying games, to when we were kids and were slowly being taught that being artistic was only okay if you were good at it.  So I don't think it's unreasonable for a game to suggest "hey, here's a game where there's a system to protect your creativity from the negative feedback of your peers," because I think there may very well be lots of people out there who do want to be creative, but feel like they aren't good enough to do so and don't want to get hurt trying -- and this isn't because roleplaying games are frequently socially messed up, but because collaborative creation is frequently socially messed up.                        </div>
