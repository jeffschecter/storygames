There is a powerful, monotheistic church and a number of secret societies.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about merging aspect of the Thule/Vril with the Cthulhu mythos--minus the nazism. At this point it is just background flavor, but could be developed further.<br/><br/>Scions of the Black Sun\u2014Cosmic Horror. Eldritch Arcana. Forbidden Knowledge. Cultists of this order seek to awaken slumbering, monstrous deities beyond human comprehension. With sorcery these cultists summon supernatural terrors and use super-science to create advanced technology. The scions are spreading their dark tentacles to all corners of the world. It is their desire to destroy both heaven and earth\u2014-with the reward from the Elder Things of a paradise deep within the hollow earth fueled by a black sun.<br/><br/>Or is the Cthulhu mythos related to the seas? And I go with the black sun/hollow earth as a separate cult?<br/><br/>Thoughts please!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463455/#Comment_463455" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-19T18:44:18+00:00" title="May 19, 2017  6:44PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get the sense from your Cthulhu mythos question that you're probably not that into the Cthulhu mythos. This isn't a problem or a flaw, but I do suggest that you might want to simply disregard the mythos angle as anything except superficial inspiration if you're not that into it. While I absolutely adore intertextualism myself as a creative tool, I don't think that it really works when people grab stuff from sources superficial sources - it just becomes a "reference", that highest form of comedy known to sitcom television. I think it's much more fun when intertextual crossbreeding is done with gravitas and full appreciation of whatever source material.<br/><br/>Aside from that, would you like to tell more about your literary ambitions here - the thematic purposes you have in mind for this secret society? The way my own creative process works, that's where I get the compass for what things should look like. For example, making the society <i>less</i> nazi is something that I would find deeply counterintuitive for certain purposes, e.g. if I was trying to make it scary and politically current. On the other hand, if I was trying to make something fun and fantastic and psychologically safe, it'd make perfect sense.<br/><br/>Riffing off your idea for the Scions, it occurs to me that if they're using "super-science", then presumably their eldritch patrons are instructing them in scientific knowledge. For it to be meaningfully scientific (as opposed to a mere different label for magic), it presumably involves both learning things and building things. This in turn suggests a monastery-like organization to me, and that surely means a dual organizatory structure where the conspiracy has a "secular" branch responsible for funding and secrecy, and the "cenobitic" branch where people devote themselves to the academic pursuits of magic and science, free from worldly distractions. The movement of individuals between these branches, and their mutual responsibilities towards each other, combined with their different perspectives and concerns, seem like good sources of event inspiration. For example, the leader of the secular branch may in fact be disloyal to the cause, preferring to wield immediate influence and live a good life in the here and now, instead of helping to immanentize the eschaton like a good cultist should.<br/><br/>Another thought concerns Vril: is it fundamentally a technique, a resource or a material? Is it corruptive, transformative or empowering? Depending on the answers, the conspiracy might attempt to prevent the spread of Vril, or they might attempt to spread it out.<br/><br/>Regarding the deep earth paradise, there seem to be plenty of interesting plot points in that. Does the conspiracy need to make expeditions to prepare the coming paradise, or even just convince initiates that the place exists? Do they make spirit journeys there? Does it even exist? Does the black sun need some sort of ritual magic ceremony to catch fire and become a true inner sun for the planet, or does the cult need to convince some prenatural organism into becoming the black sun? How many people fit into the new world? I like the premise of the cult because there is such a mix of cosmological, theological and practical engineering issues mixed up in their vision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463463/#Comment_463463" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-19T21:42:58+00:00" title="May 19, 2017  9:42PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the key to doing something reminiscent of Lovecraftian horror, if not Cthulhu mythos explicitly, is to keep it mysterious, evocative, and vague. I wouldn't worry to much about whether hollow earth is appropriate or not, just go with what interests you. Other than that I would dole out information sparingly, as in even the members of the society don't fully understand what they believe/know. <br/><br/>So this is in the past right? Or rather a secondary world that looks similar to earths past? Is the monotheistic church like Christianity or something else? I would personally make it something else, analogous but not the catholic church. They could worship the three faced god of justice, love, and fate or something. Making it analogous but different means the players can tease out their specific beliefs in play, rather than assuming its just like real history but with magic (if you have magic, I don't know the specifics). This creates a fertile ground for your secret society because there aren't as many per-conceived notions for you or the players.<br/><br/>Maybe there are forbidden texts of the religion, those who were sworn to keep them secret begin to instead worship the strange entities mentioned within them. Are they a secret part of the churches mythology or something completely different that the church quashed. Maybe you can run with the science angle, this secret society is more enlightened in many ways than the church. Hence why it has such a draw. There are more advances of medicine and machinery. But is there a darker purpose to these gifts? Is the path to this new science too easy?<br/><br/>Anyway I'm just spit balling, without knowing more specifics I can't say more. It kind of sounds like you just want permission to mix and match and you already have an idea in mind. If that's all you need, just go for it. H.P. Lovecraft has been hugely influential because people went ahead and took what they liked and mixed it all up.

But will breath some life into nameless cultists that may be encountered--not just some random dude. There needs to be enough there for you to go on, but also not completely weighted down in metaplot.<br/><br/>I was thinking that the eldritch patrons have helped in ushering in (for this world) an Age of Enlightenment. So you are seeing scientific and philosophical advancement arrive at an earlier time in comparison to other aspects (relative to our own history).\n<blockquote>Regarding the deep earth paradise, there seem to be plenty of interesting plot points in that.
