I planned for it to be a slightly goofy, but normal adventure. It turned into a Wizard of Oz-esq story about a man who grew up in the shadow of a distant and disapproving father growing to accept the idea of becoming a father himself.<br/><br/>As you can tell from the first few minutes of the recording, I was planning on a different story. But the party dynamic was so much more interesting than the plot I had cooked up. It felt like two players were an angel and a devil on the shoulder of another. Eventually I just started supporting that idea with events in the story. The party and I (without any OOC communication) started folding symbols into the fiction to support this narrative. <br/><br/>It all leads to a dreamlike battle over one character's soul against different negative aspects of his personality. <br/><br/><a href="http://peachesandhotsauce.com/podcasts/gencon-special" rel="nofollow">It was a fascinating game to play, I hope you have fun listening to it.</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
