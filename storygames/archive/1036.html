                    (Totally copied from my blog. Sue me:) ) Ok, here's my report: It rocked.<br/><br/>Longer version: It was cool to see people walking in the door that I'd never seen before. I was aware of the social weirdness and bravery of a group of people who are meeting for the first time with the express purpose of something as fringy and geekish as role-playing. I'm totally thrilled we had such a neat bunch of folks come to the first JiffyCon.<br/><br/>Now for the gaming! I ran two sessions of 1001 Nights. In my first session, I had Nathan P and Brennan Taylor. Iâ€™d never met either of them, and this was the very first game of 1001 Nights Iâ€™d run for folks not in on it since the beginning. Nervous? Yeah, a bit. But Nathan wrote Carry, which Iâ€™d commented on at StoryGames, and Brennan is IPR, and heck, they were here to game, so letâ€™s have at it!<br/><br/>Character creation worked smoothly, and they both came up with great characters. Itâ€™s interesting to see who picks a Courtier from the list, and who brings their own slant into the game. These two both went off the list. Nathanâ€™s dwarf entertainer was as emotionally damaged as his back, Brennanâ€™s noble hostage African prince was the very picture of trapped decadence, and my little gardener played the foil between them. <br/><br/>Ambitions seem to naturally point to other Courtiers fairly often, which I think is awesome, but which I didnâ€™t want to write in as a Rule. In this case, I wanted to give the prince a skin rash using some herbal thing (I envied his smooth pampered skin), and the Prince wanted to find someone at Court to trust, and from the very start, that seemed to be the dwarf.<br/><br/>I framed the first Story, casting them as a hard-working and worthy brother and an idle, slacker sister. Nathan and Brennan both caught on to the system of declaring interests pretty quick, but I think Brennanâ€™s suggestion of having someone else GM the first Story so I can demo how that works is really good, especially as I head to GenCon. <br/><br/>We told a great Story about the siblings going looking for water. I got to do just the right amount of GM outline, saying â€œThereâ€™s a rustle in the brush behind you, as of some wild animalâ€. A few moments later, Nathan colored that in as a tiger, intent on devouring the sister. Brennan stepped up and had the sister bargain her life in exchange for her brother finding water for their people. How intense is that?!?! So, the message we all got as Courtiers was that the prince was more noble than he appeared, and the sister got eaten. <br/><br/>What I liked was the way we had a Story that could have come right out of a fairytale book by the end. I actually told the second Story, about the Boy of Earth who visited the Clouds, as a bed-time story for my kids, and it was awesome.<br/><br/>The second session was Jasper, Mark, and Jon as players, and I tried the thing Brennan suggested, leading folks through Courtier creation, setting up the Court, then handing the first Story over to Jasper so I could demo the declaring interests bit. It worked ok, but it was later in the day, and the players didnâ€™t know each other at all, which resulted in a little hesitancy to interrupt and declare things. Our first Story was *fantastic*. Jasper framed it up, with a king, a princess, and a talking monkey in an isolated tower. Jon was the king, Mark was the princess, and I was the monkey. We all fell really naturally into nearly Shakespearian speech-patterns â€“ lots of â€œMy master bids me come and tell youâ€ and â€œFather, I have only one wish in all the worldâ€ and so on. <br/><br/>Thereâ€™s this thing that happens, where you are interested in something and you want to declare it, but you donâ€™t want to seem rude and interrupt whoeverâ€™s talking â€“ the skill to learn is the use of an â€˜asideâ€™ voice, so everyone knows what youâ€™ve declared but the flow isnâ€™t broken. Kind of like being on the phone and answering a question in the room at the same time. <br/><br/>Jon said afterward (and here I paraphrase) that it was kind of like railroading, but without the pain, and it didnâ€™t *have*  to happen, just gave direction. <br/>Anyway, thatâ€™s my report.                </div>

                            Meg,<br/><br/>The game was a lot of fun. The thing I found most fascinating about this game is that all of the actual mechanics take place within the story, and there are post-story effects on the Courtiers. Pre-story, it's just narration. The actual characters, the Courtiers, are a kind of interlude between the very involved and emotionally intense stories. Pretty cool.<br/><br/>The stories we made were excellent, and definitely seemed like they came right out of a storybook. It's amazing how easy it is to create one of these, and it is sort of a collaborative synthesis of every story the players at the table have ever heard.                        </div>

                            It was really fun, and made stories that were interesting not just to look back on, but to be involved in.  It has the same effect Dogs has: everyone knows the Arabian Nights stories, so it's easy to know what you should be doing and "buy in." <br/><br/>I would have liked to play longer, to get a better feel for the court scenes and the interactions there; I don't think we played with those as much as we might have with more time. Though it was totally fun even with the court being minor...and maybe it's never really as important as the stories within the story?<br/><br/>I think that extra layer helped a lot to free our creativity. The stories don't directly affect the PCs so there was less shyness. Now, of course, it's silly that we should need that extra layer. We were still affecting the sub-story characters and our main PCs are equally fictional...but psychologically there's a difference. Maybe because there's less investment in the sub-story characters, I think, but it's also probably just gamer baggage: Oh no! don't dare to affect someone else's holy, enshrined character through - gasp - PLAY!<br/><br/>Anyway, what I'm saying (again) is that it's a good game.                        </div>

*Exactly*<br/><br/>And yes, in a longer game, we'd have had more time to develope the Court scenes.                        </div>
