I'm not happy with it yet, but I don't know what to do to fix it. Specifically, I'm not satisfied with the "Playing the Game" and "GM Guide" chapters. And there's a few other issues that I don't feel I've covered properly, like abstraction and scale in resolution, and how the Rust behaves, and how to use the Price as an effect mechanic (and I can't even explain what I mean by that last one). I'm too close to the damned thing, having worked at it feverishly for the past week or so. I'm so close that I can't even see it without crossing my eyes, which hurts.<br/><br/>So what I need is some other eyes, some eyes at a distance. I'd like to solicit the help of any and all ashcan customers who want to take a look at this thing and give me some thoughts on it. If you've got the ashcan, just drop me a line and I'll email you the text. (Also tell me your email, if we've never exchanged emails before)<br/><br/>There's been a few small rule changes, too. Some little tweaks to some of the Psyche mechanics, and also a new Deadlock mechanic that I like way more than the old one (everyone was bidding high numbers all the time, and it just got predictable and boring).<br/><br/>So, if you wanna take a look at this, speak up! Any and all insights are invaluable, even (especially) the ones that seem super-obvious to you.<br/><br/>-Marshall                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
