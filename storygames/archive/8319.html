Space Opera is probably the easiest to port to a game environment inasmuch as it's an adventure genre that tends to play fast and loose with physics.  Another is post-apocalypse.  These aren't the only ones, but even in these two, there's a shit-ton of ways you could come at it.  From a literary standpoint, the touchstone for space opera is Dune.  For post-apoc, it's probably the Road Warrior.<br/><br/>At least as a starting point for this discussion, why not list a few things you like?

What makes sci-fi sci-fi? (Full disclosure per the recommending friends' games thread - once I spent the night at Joshua's house and his cat jumped on my chest <i>all night long</i>)<br/><br/>After having read Shock and thought about the sci-fi I liked and the sci-fi I thought was crap, part of what makes it sci-fi is that it's taking some idea, some real issue that we know and can relate to, and flinging it into the future with some kind of crazy circumstances. Say machines have taken over the world, or there's synthetic humans, or whatever. Everything else is just trappings and color.<br/><br/>And I think that makes the "sci-fi" part of the "sci-fi game." Like I think Blue Planet is good sci-fi. When you add the game part though you have to look at mechanics, how it pushes the sci fi, all that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I want there, to be at the basis, a question of science being raised, and then I want to explore it's impact on humanity.<br/><br/>So, other planets for the sake of other planets bores me. But other planets to explore what it means to be a human with humans existing on more than one planet might be interesting.<br/><br/>Aliens same thing. Just for the sake of being there, boring. Aliens to see what that would mean as a person to encounter a truly alien species or culture (say one that rendered you and yours obsolete, that would be interesting).<br/><br/>It's where games like Cyberpunk go way wrong for me (cyberware being just a way to give your character superpowers), and games like Shock: Social Science Fiction go way right for me.<br/><br/>I guess what it breaks down to is this, science-fiction, the setting, does nothing for me. Science-fiction, the impact of science on the lives of people, has potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jmhpfan" title="jmhpfan"><img alt="jmhpfan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jmhpfan">jmhpfan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183684/#Comment_183684" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T10:40:58+00:00" title="December 16, 2008 10:40AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just finished listening to the Quarter Share series over at podio books and I use to play EVE online and I keep thinking that there is a game in there somewhere that would be fun.

Future, past--no matter: the science or innovation elements drive the narrative, and the narrative theme involves feelings and consequences.<br/><br/>That said, I love me some way-out, hard sci fi that's mostly about "whiz bang" or using it as a wrapper for theological or metaphysical contemplations. I think 2001 is a solid example of the latter, and I love it, and yet I wouldn't even hazard a guess as to how to "capture" its scope in an RPG. Yeah, you can do the "survival horror" element--Man V Machine--or you can noodle with the inter-crew conflicts around HAL--Man v Man; subset: Paternity v Authority--but trying to get at BOTH of those AND the whole story of the monoliths, in particular the last 45 minutes or so (the Peaking Period, for you acidheads)... good luck.<br/><br/>Space westerns/space opera, I think, are an entirely different genre, and in fact are sub-genres of Westerns and Operas. Ditto for The Hero's Quest... IN SPAAAACE! The science is color, whether it bothers to be "scientific" at all. I'd take all those off the table, to keep this thread from turning into a "my favorite d20 supplement that does Novel Series X," but I'm not the OP.<br/><br/>Finally, "proper" sci fi's greatest gift, to the reader, is that it helps one think way outside of daily routine and situations, while not utterly divorcing the experience to the point where it's pure escapism (whiz bang, again). <i>The Diamond Age</i> interests me not only because of its rich (technology changed) tapestry of cultures, but mainly because I could theoretically have to deal, some day, with gray sludge nano outbreaks or tech-assited telepathy or street gang crime with biohazard weapons... never too soon to think ahead, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183701/#Comment_183701" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T11:21:55+00:00" title="December 16, 2008 11:21AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Veles, <br/><br/>You could use Shock: to run something like Wolfe's Book of the New Sun. <br/><br/>You'd run it as a long sequence of vignettes, which isn't too far from how the stories are told anyhow, and the shocks, issues and praxes might change along the way as different *tagonists appeared and had their time in the spotlight of the story.

The appeal of Book of the New Sun is that it's a really complicated literary puzzle. There are so many layers of what is happening in the book. The first sentence plainly states the plot of the entire book but almost no one would notice this or understand it on first reading. The time paradoxes in the book are so elegantly dealt with that most people don't even realize how the book actually ends, or that Time Travel was involved at all. It's a lot like that Heinlein short story, "--All You Zombies--" but without ever explicitly coming out as such.<br/><br/>There are other things about it that would be hard to replicate in a game. It is common that what we assume is a metaphor by the narrator turns out to be an exacting description. There is a mausoleum that the character was fond of visiting in his adolescence, and I still have not figured out whom it contains, though it is obvious that this would unlock yet more secrets about the book.<br/><br/>So, a game about discovering who your mother is, using myth and parable as a narrative technique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183707/#Comment_183707" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T11:41:20+00:00" title="December 16, 2008 11:41AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sci Fi is fantasy pretending that its not. <br/><br/>What I expect from Science Fiction is that it will present me with fantastic things and then pretend that they are not fantastic. No we're not teleporting, we disemble the molecules and send them down on an energy carrior wave and then reassemble them. No were not fighting demons, were fighting aliens, or trans dimensional life forms , or something of the like.  This leads to all kind of human questions because even if something is Fantastic in sci fi, it shouldn't be beyond understanding ( how do dragons and honeybees fly are variations on the same question but the answer to each depending on the genre is different, dragons fly cause there fricking dragons, and bumblebees fly because of the turbulence aerodynamics or something, ). <br/><br/>As for what makes a good sci fi game? I would wager alot of the same stuff that makes a good fantasy game, see simularities and success between star wars systems and everything else. Someone's parable is that any good system can be made to run starwars is perhaps revealing because its exactly saying that the science fiction in the story of star wars doesn'treally matter. Whether its indentured servants or droids, 6 shooters or blasters, science fiction is the genre pretending that its not a genre for the most part. <br/><br/>my two sence. I think a good sci fi game itself will focus on providing either a sim or narrative experance of people in wierd and vagulely explained sitautions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Further discussion of aerodynamics is off-topic, so we can discuss in whispers if you like. But most importantly, <em>how</em> a dragon flies doesn't make it science fiction. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)" rel="nofollow">naturalistic</a>, "repeatable experiment" nature of the <em>question</em> might make it be, though, if that's a substantive part of a story. Particularly if it's not just nerdwank and actually says something about the (real) universe. Beowulf and Bilbo sure don't care how dragons fly, though. It doesn't matter what they Reynolds Number of a dragon is. It matters that they fly because they burn villages and hoard gold and it can do whatever it wants.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Someone's parable is that any good system can be made to run starwars is perhaps revealing because its exactly saying that the science fiction in the story of star wars doesn'treally matter. Whether its indentured servants or droids, 6 shooters or blasters, science fiction is the genre pretending that its not a genre for the most part.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>That's Clinton R. Nixon's premise. That's because Star Wars is fantasy with blasters and spaceships. It's science fiction as much as, say, Deadwood, if the final episode had shown it to all be a time travel adventure.</p>\n<p>A useful distinction that I find:</p>\n<p>Fantasy, you might say, is interested in stories about heroes and, as such, is usually cast in a mythological time (Once upon a time, maybe, or perhaps a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away). Science fiction is concerned with the movement of <em>whole societies</em>. It's concerned with <em>humanity</em>, not just <em>a person</em>. It's about the ideas, the speculation, and the metaphor about the human condition. It can be as broad or thoughtful as you like.</p>\n<p>I'm not super-comfortable with Fantasy fiction. I've read some of the Earthsea books and the Chronicles of Narnia. I've read Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit and Beowulf, and then start grasping at straws... um... A Midsummer Night's Dream? Someone more comfortable with Fantasy can probably illuminate us on its salient features. But what I'm familiar with has everything to do arationality \u2014 the universe works through high-level systems like Magical Energy, or even the caprice of the gods. Usually, in my experience, "how the Universe works" isn't explored too deeply, except to say that there are beings at some point that make it happen.</p>\n<p>Science fiction assumes a naturalistic view of the Universe. There are laws in the very fabric of things that lack agendas or personalities. They cover physics, chemistry, biology, and often human interactions. We live in a Universe that doesn't care about us, none of us have a destiny, and yet we exist and have to make sense of it all.</p>\n<p>These are not definitional and they identify fiction (both Fantasy and Science Fiction) that I enjoy more than anything else. But categorization isn't that interesting to me anyway. Finding ways to communicate what we want from each other, though, that's interesting.</p>\n<p>So, Josh is talking about "tall ships in space". Travel between stars is one of those things that gets glossed over a lot. I'm reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-t2y0JJ1ZYQC&amp;dq=darkness+in+the+sky+vinge&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=2Mtcal2ygs&amp;source=bn&amp;sig=als1yi_ADEbnvXLaAp6DhDewn_c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result" rel="nofollow">A Deepness in the Sky</a> by Vernor Vinge right now. In it, he proposes that there is a vast, thousands-of-years-old trading network that spans the stars. They use ramscoops (a reasonably plausible mode of interstellar transport) and freeze themselves in shifts during the centuries of travel it takes for anyone to get there. It's a long way from "tall ships", but it's well-reasoned.</p>\n<p>It sounds like that's not what you want. You want space battles that aren't over in seconds, and you want boarding parties, and you want wizened captains with tales to tell. What you want, I'm guessing, is space fantasy, \xe1 la Star Wars or Firefly. There's certainly good fun to be had there, but your question still isn't whether on not to have aliens. It's what you want to say. If you want to talk about heroic space captains, <a href="http://burningwheel.com" rel="nofollow">Burning Wheel</a> is probably good, as is the <a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/solarsystem" rel="nofollow">Solar System</a>. They're both good for character-driven fantasy.</p>\n<p>But I'm also curious what else you want.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183761/#Comment_183761" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T14:09:29+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  2:09PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to visit strange worlds and talk to inhabitants with bizarre customs.

Gene Wolfe has the mind of Sherlock Holmes, and he uses it to write sci fi. Players should not be expected to approach that level of brilliance, but I think the great things about his style can be taken into a game.<br/><br/>The nice thing about Gene Wolfe's books is that it often feels like he is playing a game with his readers. Oh, another thought. An easy way to model his fiction would be to overtly make a game structured on Apollonian myths, combined with Shock:'s Shocks. Shock largely doesn't fit because the protagonist/antagonist model makes no sense in his stories.

If you go by the very beginning and end of the book you could argue that 'he's really talking about' societies and universes and such, but to me the book was about a very specific set of human relationships and endeavors (which failed miserably, because humans are depressing and space is dangerous.) But it was also full of lots of 'hard science', that was not used to comment on the social interactions at all that I remember -- it was just that they were all scientists/astronauts and the task they were trying to perform involved science.<br/><br/>I can see people reading the book differently, I suppose, but to me the science was entirely secondary, and so any statements the book was making about society were no different in character to those made in, like, <i>Crime &amp; Punishment</i> or a Charles Dickens novel. But maybe that just means it wasn't actually a science fiction novel, and had been mislabelled, I don't know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I doubt this was his intention; I am sure he intended to draw some parallels between the flight to Titan (yes, they do -- and yes, it is treated as approximately as difficult as you describe. The world has just nuked itself to death so the circumstances argue for a desperate effort of some kind.) But for me the entire message of relevance contained in the book, which is almost entirely an emotional message, is contained in the failure of what is essentially the last remnant of human civilization to avoid breaking down in entirely human ways, sabotaging the vanishingly small amount of hope that remains to them and making their last few weeks of life completely miserable. It's a very effective book, as a corrective to the kind of ridiculously heroic sci-fi tropes that ascribe superhuman resourcefullness and coolness under fire to the protagonists, seemingly at the convenience of the author. Most sci-fi books regularly have humans performing tasks that, while possible, require a perfect combination of circumstance and human ability; in Titan those tasks are presented as goals, and then shown to be totally unfeasible once actual humans (and to some degree, actual science) are introduced. The same cultural circumstances that create the need for heroic action make that heroic action impossible.<br/><br/>The last section reads, consequently, like a deus ex machina that runs entirely counter to the core of the story. It turns out that all these failures were 'enough', from a point of view I can only describe as a kind of hallucinatory, narcissistic Darwinism, because the efforts involved resulted in the eventual recreation of carbon-based life -- I have a lot of trouble taking it seriously, even though it's certainly a very interesting set of chapters. It's kind of like a fever dream -- I could imagine the scenario playing out in the mind of the final surviving protagonist, right around the point where he died of exposure on the wasteland of the moon in question.<br/><br/>So sure, if you manage to take the last part seriously, it could be seen as a comment on the rest of the story. If so it is not a very interesting comment. I found the rest of the novel extremely affecting, and part of that was because I saw it as engaging with the failures of heroic science fiction -- this alone would seem to suggest that it is in fact a work of science-fiction, which is kind of a strange way to qualify. But mostly it was affecting because of the story itself, which involved a lot of science, but not to my mind very much science fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184733/#Comment_184733" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-23T15:42:34+00:00" title="December 23, 2008  3:42PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

You can't address the end of the world without positing some sort of fantasy, a world-shaking thing. You might even call it a "shock".</p>\n<p>Oh! A good example! <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067141/" rel="nofollow">Glen and Randa</a> is a movie from 1971 that posits the end of civilization and culture. The story is told almost entirely through the two eponymous characters and another person they meet. It's a very, very personal scale story, but it's really about humanity and culture. It's also up there with Silent Running as some of the saddest Science Fiction ever created, though Glen and Randa arrives at this weird, enlightened space by the end. I recommend it if you have a significant other and a cozy blanket to watch it under.</p>\n<p>What I'm saying is that the scale of the story is not definitional, nor are the width of the strokes in which the characters are delineated.</p>\n<p>A counterexample: <a href="http://www.kingsolver.com/bookshelf/bean_trees.asp" rel="nofollow">Pigs in Heaven</a> is straight up fiction (no speculation present) about the development of an unusual family. It's a story about a small number of very specific relationships that have very little impact on the rest of humanity. You can draw conclusions from it about the nature of family, about children and what they see in adults, about how adults sort of stumble through life succeeding to various non-optimal degrees, but fundamentally, it's about Turtle and Taylor. It's very personal and much of the joy comes from watching Turtle grow up, just like watching a real kid. The book is structured so that you share in the experience, more than enlightening commentary. As such, it has this sort of Will Eisner moral ambiguity to a lot of the events.</p>\n<p>Now, if we set such circumstances in an apocalypse, where the characters are the "last humans" or whatever, they suddenly represent humanity. They represent you and me. They represent all families everywhere because you've said, "These are the last people in the world [who matter]". Their actions either effect or are somehow representative of the rest of society. (The definition, of course, doesn't address the quality if implementation)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184819/#Comment_184819" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-24T11:26:15+00:00" title="December 24, 2008 11:26AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JB Bell participated in a recent playtest run of Diaspora and pinned down what we're about in that game -- hubris.

To be sure, Tyrell <em>thinks</em> he's engaging in (and defeating the consequences of) hubris because that's how he likes to think of himself. He lives in a temple fer Pete's sake. But it's the <em>moral</em> consequences of his actions, of his treating people inhumanly, that gets him killed. He thinks he's challenging God, but there is no God. There is only a vengeful slave who's smarter than everyone else and whose grief is as strong as his hate. He's not killed because he challenged the natural order.

To make it work, you have to build expectations before, and the wonder has to be meaningful for it to have a real impact. Like, "That's no moon..." implies some heavy stuff: that the Empire has built an <em>entire moon</em>, just to do bring down the pain. But you need to know that that's a big deal. Like, everyone isn't building moons and driving them around the Galaxy. That's why you get the big establishing shot and all the discussion. (Frankly, I think the scene's a little clumsy, but whatever)</p>\n<p>But that can exist in any fantastic, or even unusual, form of fiction. John Glenn describing the view from orbit in The Right Stuff, for instance. In a sense, The Right Stuff is "science nonfiction", in that it details several moments that, in real ways, changed the world, but it's also history. It's not speculating, except in the details.</p>\n<p>Or in Lord of the Rings when Helm's Deep is described. It's really awesome! But no one would argue that it's science fiction.</p>\n<p>I'd say that the sense of wonder is a powerful tool, but it's not what makes something be good science fiction. It just makes it impactful, whatever it is.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185077/#Comment_185077" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-27T23:18:48+00:00" title="December 27, 2008 11:18PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to totally agree with justinpickard.  Yes, there are many other elements of science fiction, such as the movements of societies instead of singular characters, and the effects of advanced technology on society as a whole.  From what I've read in this thread, it seems that there are games that already cover these areas.  However, I don't think I've ever seen a game where Sense of Wonder was somehow codified in the mechanics.  If someone could create a game that always creates that moment, it would certainly satisfy a craving that I've been feeling for a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
