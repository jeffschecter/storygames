                    This is a followup thread for Sara (shutupgirl) because I'm rather confused about what she's talking about when she says she has a game with no system.  I'm mostly confused because it doesn't seem possible to me to have a game with no system.  So, we must be either using the same terms to mean different things and thus talking past each other or she's discovered how to do something I think is impossible.  Of course, I'm really interested if she's done the impossible as that means I have to re-evaluate what I think.<br/><br/>Anywho...  Sara, what does your game come packaged with it?  Setting material?  Character creation rules?  Resolution rules?  What?  If I can pick it up, read it, and then play... I'm wondering how it doesn't come with a system.<br/><br/>*BTW...  I hope I don't sound antagonistic because I don't feel antagonistic here.  I'm just curious.*                </div>

                            This thread, and the dicussion, is all based off an intial discussion that left me not quite sure what my product is in the first place!   -It should be noted that this is still a work in progress and I'm still writing it, although the game itself has been in existance in awhile.  (I abandoned it and then picked it up recently and started actually putting it into a format, and preparing a beta test)<br/><br/>It brought up The idea or rather, the questioning of what to call it, and depending on who is asked, it seems to get a different answer, so I'm pretty curious myself by now.<br/><br/>It doesn't fit into the context of setting given the explanations, and the reason why I call it a systemless game is that it was pointed out that there are narrative style games in which are played by simply having the entire plot planned out ahead of time.   (Think of live theater games, where an Storyteller has already determined the plot and it's up to the players themselves to figure out what happened)<br/><br/>This, factored with the realization that if I changed my game once to adapt to certain style of playing, that I could do it again, left me with an uncertainty of what I have in the first place.  (I know how I want to play this particular game myself, but people have different preferences and the abundance of modding and styles of play just left me wondering what would happen if I didn't demand it ONLY be played one way...and I got something really strange, but workable out of the mix)<br/><br/>I don't consider it written fiction, because I don't define the characters, the story, and I don't even provide the history or background; all of this is moldable and is moldable without detracting from the original concept.   And yet, when it's played, no matter what format it is played under, it can be recognized as the same game.  So perhaps I'm selling a concept?   I'm not really sure; everytime I think I have started to define it, someone else calls it something else!   To my best understanding, what Iv'e got at this point, is a system for creating a game; but with a way to hard-code it with other 'systems', that make it into another format.  (such as Theater, table-tops, RPG's, By Post, Messenger, whatever)  I'd say it's just a game concept but it feels to me as if it's a bit more complete than that.<br/><br/>The best way to describe it?   It was a complete game that I first created,  and then in curiousity, then stripped down to the core elements until I could turn it into just about any format without actually ruining the concept, or change the actual game.  (all prompted by my desire to see it played on Ends and Means)<br/><br/>So, to answer Gaerik's question;<br/>I'm still working on that part, but most likely it will come with explaning in detail what makes Sanctum, Sanctum, what are the core elements that MUST exist for it to be Sanctum, and which elements cannot be removed without destroying the concept.   Then I intend to include all of the different ways to play sanctum, including possible variations, and what style of game is most likely going to occur using a certain system.   (My personal fav being Ends and Means, hands down, because it allows this 'game' to focus on character developement)<br/><br/>It may also very well include different scenero's, plot ideas, character examples, possible outcomes and histories, and various ways to set up the world.  (Because I always feel it's nice to have plenty of examples that people can use for reference so that when they DO go and modify it to how they want it to run and play, they know how to make it work)<br/><br/>So by all means, someone explain what I have here <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>   Because I keep getting different answers every time I turn around!<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, the only thing that I've done differently than some people is that instead of creating my own, or using a pre-existing system to build my game on, or work around, I went and made it potentially possible to work with several all at once, with the only thing changed by doing so, is the style of play it promotes.<br/><br/>I was asked to make a post of the Beta-Test when we run it, so maybe watching it broken down through play will help explain what I can't really explain without just showing the actual 'product' itself <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  -which I'm trying to avoid until the beta test is going!-                        </div>

                            What you have is a setting. A game is something that offers a set of rules for facilitating a particular play experience. That's a mildly political viewpoint, but anyway the viewpoint is a common one in these parts.<br/><br/>That said, I think it'd be exciting bordering on revolutionary if you packaged this - if indeed you aim to package it commercially - as a "roleplaying game," and then as your Rules section simply provide several chapters explaining how best to adapt the setting to different systems. (With a couple of freely-licensed systems included in back as appendices, of course.)                        </div>

                            That's what I do intend to do, although it will probally be on a very small scale because I'll be funding it myself.<br/><br/>I had always thought of it as a world, aka a setting, until people started telling me that it wasn't by thier definition because I didn't have characters, history, or even a pre-decided soluation or cause,  So, I kept adapting what I called it until frankly, I just gave up on what to call it at all!  (peg it down to me being a novice at forums, and game developement, as this is the only game I've created and done anything with)n  -although, when it comes times to market it in the stores, or online, what am I calling it?   Most newer gamers just consider everything a game...so this is where I get confused with terms.  I don't think like a developer, I'm thinking like a consumer; it's a confusing thing-<br/><br/>I do intend to include a few systems in the back and how to adapt the game, and if the beta testing goes well, I'm hoping to seal a few deals that allow me to place the focus game that 'teaches people how it can be played' as the primary example, since it is my personal favoriate.   I see my 'setting' as a means to futher systems that I personally love by placing it with a 'setting' that I think appeals to a large audience.   -People seem pretty pysched over the beta, so I'm nervous and excited-<br/><br/>Then I will basically have a single 'setting' that is step by step adapted to every sort of style wanted out of a roleplay game, from larp, table-top to theater staging and what to expect when adapted.   -it's been suggested that if it goes well, that I branch into making individual books that go further into each playstyle and flesh it all out so that people have some pre-made worlds, ideas, settings, and guides.<br/><br/>Sara.                        </div>

                            Characters and a predetermined history are also things that are not setting.

                            Sanctum: The Fallout has core things that exist.  No matter how you play it, what you write to answer for the questions that the core things create, or whether you go with plot or character development, the core is what everything starts with and because of this, it remains the same 'game'.<br/><br/>Whether it expands or remains the core, it's the same essential game.<br/>This way, people who never play 'by the book' can do what they want with it, while the 'background' and possible storylines and world creation guide with example plots and histories will give people who want or expect the full monty what they need in order to play right out of the package.<br/><br/>It's sort of like having A be the 'game', and then depending on what they want from the game, telling them what to do with it in order to get that.                        </div>

                            Okay... how does that lead to Sanctum teaching people how it can be played? That sounds more like a reiteration of your multiple-systems idea, which is very good but is less like education than like choosing from a menu.                        </div>

                            And with that attitude, you will get a few. But frankly, the old ways are dying. The traditional RPG-on-rails ship is sinking; it's a much bigger ship, and it's sinking very slowly, but it's sinking nonetheless. Now is not the time to do things just because they've always been done that way.                        </div>

                            Hrmm..how to best describe it.<br/><br/>I keep meeting alot of people who are in love with the idea of RPG's but most of them are too complicated for them because there are rules upon rules, upon rules.    My goal with Sanctum is to not just give the world, but make use of the simpliest method of playing it different styles?   The focus being on either two things, and up to the player/GM's desire...Character Development, Plot Development or both.<br/><br/>By showing how it is done with one style, people have a way to understand the potential and let loose from there, using whatever means they want to do it with, because they already have the core ingredient to do it with, and an idea of the different ways it can adapt, evolve or variate. <br/><br/>Did I explain it better this time? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Hi Sara,<br/><br/>Sanctum is the game where players from any time in history who are related thematically come together, right?  It sounds like a solid situation that you are providing from which the players get to create their own customizable setting.  I like the fact that you want to provide ways for people to use it with many different rule sets/systems.  That sounds like a unique design challenge.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shutupgirl</cite>Hrmm..how to best describe it.</blockquote>
I suspect that the best way to describe it would be to give some concrete examples from your notes or from the text as written. I feel like this thread is in danger of drowning in abstraction, and that you are struggling to explain the game in terms of concepts. If you're talking about a text/game/object that actually exists, referencing it directly might help you get a handle on what concepts will best describe it. Especially if what you want is for other people to help you define those concepts. Right now there seems to be a lot of talk <i>around</i> the game, or about other concepts of games that may or may not be similar. I suggest starting by concretely explaining what it is you have, or maybe referencing it (since Emily seems to know something about it, so maybe you've talked about it in more detail elsewhere?)                        </div>

                            Yes, that's the one.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>I can't even begin to tell you how helpful this forum has been.   I've gone from not knowing how to layout the game  as i'm writing it for others, to a solid understanding of just what I need to do, and make sure I explain with detail...or in some cases, what to leave out.   It's been confusing trying to get a hold on what everyone calls different things, even though when they use the terms in a passage, I get the drift of what they mean by it there.<br/><br/>I've been in love with storytelling and RPG's since I was a child, but it isn't always easy to get involved in RPG's, even DnD!  People get snobby over rules, and expect what has been 'common sense' for them to be common sense for someone who has no idea what they are doing yet.  This always bugged me about some RPG's, because I think sometimes there are alot of people who want to game, but don't feel they have a place in the RPG world.<br/><br/>So I'm trying to incorporate all of the things I love about RPG's and get rid of everything I hate and hope that I'm not alone in what I like and don't like, and then settle it into a foundation.<br/><br/>That's what Sanctum is to me.<br/><br/>Again...Story-games has done wonders for my understanding of modifications, gamers and outlooks on systems!   I feel alot more confident about what I'm doing as a result.<br/><br/><br/>As for the game, Me and a few others chatted in Gabbly for a bit, and I've told a few people, but I'd really like to keep the specific details under until I at least get the first draft finished.  (almost done, I promise)   I'm still new at this, and when I get the draft done, it will explain sanctum better than me paraphrasing it.  (the beta game might help too)<br/><br/>The core is absolute and easily explainable because I've had it for the last twelve or so years, but I don't want to give it all away before I have a bit more to back it up with, if that makes any sense.                        </div>

                            Excellent!  I think I'm getting a much better handle on what you are doing.  Could you do a couple more things for me?  If what Emily said was accurate I'm interested in seeing the game/setting described more concretely.<br/><br/>1.)  Could you describe your work in a concrete manner?  What is the theme here that you are selling (even if you give it away)?  What are some concrete elements of the setting, ie the parts that you can't take away without it being Sanctum?  Most of what you've described above seem to be design goals and not concrete elements of the product you are making.<br/><br/>2.)  Would you mind commenting on how the concrete elements you are including help you accomplish the design goals you set?  That'd be really interesting to me.<br/><br/>3.)  Some people discount Actual Play as a valid diagnostic tool but I'm not one of those people.  I'd really like to hear about some of the actual play that you've done that lead to wanting to develop this project.<br/><br/>I know that what I'm asking for above is a lot of writing but I'd find it interesting to read.                        </div>

                            Even without specifics, I love the idea of a real self-teaching game. There was a thread not long ago about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1882&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">how The Shadow of Yesterday lets players correct their character builds as they go</a> by building it into the mechanic; I like imagining how a whole game could do that, letting players flag when they think an area of the game needs more complexity or specificity in the form of a rule, and dialing it up dynamically to achieve a custom fit. <br/><br/>Self-teaching by self-building! It might be too big a design job, though. And I might be totally derailing the thread; carry on.                        </div>

                            Well, I guess I've done it by accident?<br/><br/>I have a certain way that I intend to play the beta test, but then I was thinking, (prodded by an intelligent friend who's been invaluable in this process), why limit the actual game to just one story, or one possibility when there are so many ways to go?   I couldn't make up my mind and then I realized I didn't have to; why not just set the conditions and let it fly in the hands of whoever is running the story?  Why SHOULD I choose the direction, the story or even where the plot starts and ends?    It could totally fail in practice, but the idea sounds so neat that I had to try.<br/><br/>If there are people In Minnesota or driving distance that really want to join the beta test, just let me know; I'd be more than happy to include you.   The Estimated Runtime is 6 months, but we'll be doing progress reports alot sooner.<br/><br/>I'll probally lay everything out on the table when my partner in this beta test tells me to :P   He's a bit more experienced in that department and I'm very much the rookie <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(Went ahead and spilled the beans below, I'll continue to add things as I get the time)                        </div>

                            Well, that sounds like improvised GM story rather than preset GM story, which I for one consider a very good thing for all parties involved. It isn't the same as a set of game rules that specifically says, "when the game starts, there are no rules; you're freeforming. When the players say so [in some way via mechanics], you add a rule," blah blah blah.<br/><br/>This is very much not what I think you were talking about; I'm just riffing.                        </div>

                            -Deep Breath-<br/><br/>Okay...here's Sanctum.  (Will be adding and editing to make sure this is explaining everything properly)<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>The core elements of Sanctum: The Fallout are these.<br/><br/>The Start of Game?<br/><br/>Everyone in the given city, from the moment they awake, or the moment they stumble out of their home realize that they aren't really home after all.   The game Sanctum asks, "What happens next?"  and then leaves it to players, storytellers and the imagination.   The start of game is really that simple.    You wake up...."now what?"   <br/><br/>And because I want everyone, even those who need some creative assistance or plot ideas to have fun and be able to play, I'll offer plenty of suggestions, such as possible plots, stories, histories, explanations etc, but most importantly, how to get the players doing all the work for you...because the best games are player-plot driven, as far as I'm concerned.   When the players are so busy with plot that you don't need to be involved in, then the game runs itself and you just sit back and watch it unfold.     It's not linear, so people can relive memories from their past of before they were here in Sanctum, or they can foretell events that they actually make sure happen by driving the plot.   (In ends and means, it's not a crime to figure out the outcome of what happens before you decide What happens...and this should make things really fun and fluid)<br/><br/>There is no preset number of cities that must exist on or in the world...however, The world is defined BY its cities in that each city is set apart with a themed absolute.<br/><br/>Each city's population shares a theme of sort.   From ordinary people living ordinary lives, to that everyone in that city is a fictional historical figure.   But there is no mixture of the two...it's ONE theme per city...It's what sets everything apart, what raises questions and what creates divides.   Because of this, the game can change, adapt, evolve.   If players get tired of playing the city they start with, the entire game could shift over to new characters in the same world, going from actually playing thier characters to seeing them involved as NPC's.<br/><br/>A game could have one city and one city alone, or it could eventually link several cities, but they don't start out linked...and depending on the storytellers or where the players want to bring the game, they never even have to come into play, OR they could be the main focus.<br/><br/>Because one city might be ordinary people from ordinary lives in different points of time but all from earth....but the next city might be monsterous creatures of Myth and Legend.   Another City might be historical figures throughout earth's history.   Another City might be fictional characters from legend and lore of earth.   Or, it could be a city where there is no one left living, but spirits of those who once did.<br/><br/>The things that bind Sanctum together is that no matter what elements are added, how sci-fi, how fictional, or how realistic the players and Storytellers intend to make it...Whether it is driven with Character Development (like the beta is going to be), or driven along by either player or storyteller generated plot, that each city is a theme that takes that theme and mashes everything known about the people within that city together into a pot-luck mixture of everything.  (another thing to make sure players question is that this city is the closest thing to home that they have left in the world...it's at least familiar to them, and if they do find other cities, it might be fascinating for some, but overwhelming for others...which is going to potentially ensure that people stay living in their own cities...after all, it's familiar, right?)<br/><br/>More Conditions of Sanctum?<br/><br/>There is a solid count of people per city.  There is a population and death DOES matter.<br/>for our beta game, it's 500.   If a player or Storyteller creates an NPC, that NPC becomes a part of that population...it's as simple as having a notebook and writing the name down next to a number.   When you are out of numbers, then that's it...after all, why should life be replaceable?   This is modified for other conditions within the game; such as the theme is set far into a future in which cloning is easily done, magically created, etc.   But, the ones who exist, still exist...and the ones who die, do die.   I felt this makes murder and death an accountable action and gives more value to the content.<br/><br/>For the beta game, here's the sample brochure we made. (I still need art made for the real deal) -we are going with the theme of character development but will drive the plot wherever the players want to take it...which means improvising on the storyteller's part but isn't that part of the fun?-<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fallenedge.net/SanctumTheFallout.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sanctum: The Fallout Brochure</a>  (should open in new window)<br/><br/>This is how it's adapted into a Live Action Roleplay that isn't really like any other Larps out there that I know of.  (which is exactly why alot of my larping friends want to beta test it)<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~Update~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>Proposed Index:<br/>The World of Sanctum: Starting Out â€“ pg4    (explanining the core of sanctum)  -after this chapter, master gamers need not read further to start playing-<br/>RPG Systems: Which one is right for my game? â€“ pg6  (explaining the differences between gaming systems and how to choose the right one) <br/>Freestyle vs Structured: Whatâ€™s the difference? â€“ pg10 (Explaining the difference between improving the story and planning it out, or how to do both simutaniously)<br/>Placing Focus : Plot or Character?â€“ pg18  (Discussing the pro's and cons over placing focus on plot or character development and how to balance it)<br/>Playing by Example: Sanctum in Action â€“ pg25  (examples from the beta test of Sanctum: and possibly other beta tests as well as possible timelines or plot twists)<br/>RPG Systems â€“ One for every kind of gamerâ€¦ â€“ pg 42  (A list of systems that I think Sanctum will work great with and loose instructions on how to adapt the game to that system, and what to expect from it when you do.  Also, where to find or purchase those systems)                        </div>

                            Keep in mind that the 500 is for this playtest and it's being played as a LARP.<br/><br/>   The things I want to encourage in the playtest are player development, player plot and getting them to understand that not only are there people they can choose to interact with or bring into the story who aren't represented by other players, but that there IS a finite number.<br/><br/>One thing that has always bugged me in live action games is the tendancy to people to justify deaths, or not be bothered by them at all, because after all...they are NPC's and there's more of those where that came from.   So this way, it's considered a resource and a potentially finite one.<br/><br/>I also like the idea of characters existing for more than to just exist.<br/>Players have the ability to create new NPC's by interacting with them or bringing them into a story.   The moment an NPC is brought into play and used in a story, scene or is played out by the Storyteller/GM, then they shouldn't just fade off into the background forever...what if someone wants to find this NPC?    What if this NPC becomes a mainstay in plot or people's stories?     By actually taking the time to write his name down, and the scenes he's been in, or the things he's done.  (players are encouraged to add to this, sort of like keeping notes for thier own references)   In a way, the NPC's can turn just as real as the characters that are PC's...which I think while aiming for a character developement style RPG, is a good thing.<br/><br/>500 is meant to be a large number, especially since it's only a sixth month game...<br/>But think of it this way...accidents happen <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>It's giving me room to let catastophe happen without stealing the entire plot pool, but make what happens impactful just the same.     Lets say someone goes nuts and starts holding people hostage.    It's going to be a little more personal if someone knows that NPC, isn't it?<br/><br/>One of my ideas for the beta, is randomly selecting assigned (listed) NPC's, PC's and unassigned NPC's for a traumatic event and letting the characters deal with it.<br/>It may never come to fruitation; it all depends on what the players are doing in the game, and if they even NEED any conflict or storyteller generated story.   (Honestly, with the people I think will be playing, we'll most likely be background GM's, watching it all run by itself and letting people take matters into thier own hands)<br/><br/>As for it being only a matter of time; isn't it a matter of time before anything happens?     How long can you expect questioners to sit around and be told "don't worry about it?"    How long before a questioner gets in the face of a skeptic and tries to shove 'truth' down thier throat?    How long before the realist gets fed up with the questioner because they aren't pulling their weight, or call out the skeptic because they are just whining about "the way it used to be?"<br/><br/>I don't think I'll need to create conflict, but I'm hoping plenty of it is going to be created just by the fundamental differences in the character's personalities.                        </div>

Out of curiosity; is it LARP-only, or does it work as tabletop too (can't imagine why it couldn't)?<br/><br/>If there are 500 characters, how many players you'll aproximately have? Is it a kind of character pool, with players playing only one character at time, and if that character is for some reason removed from play, players take another character? Or does one player control multiple characters?                        </div>

                            Nope, not LARP Only!  -Although I'll have to say that LARP is the way that I'd definiately prefer to play this world-<br/><br/>Sanctum is meant to workable as ANY Format, whether text based, table-top, LARP, dice, cards...and in my book/final version, I intend to start by stating the 'rules' of Sanctum, and what makes it Sanctum, and then expanding piece by piece to allow those who don't need anything else to be finished, while those who do need more to go on in order to make a story, or game, can continue reading and get additional information for completing/setting it all up.<br/><br/>Ideally, I would like several systems to include in my book.  In return for letting me use their system in my book to demonstrate how my world can be played with that system, I am in essense, promoting their system as the ideal way to play Sanctum.  (More of telling them what the game is like when played that way and what ways it is modified)   I'd also reference where that system could be bought.  (sparking interest in actually buying that system if they don't already have it)<br/><br/>I'm going to have approximately 20-50 Beta Testers.   (I've had 50+ who have said they really want to play, but not all of them know if they can make the time committment because of RL, and I'm not going to assume they -all- will show up)<br/><br/>For my beta game, I am yes, using a character pool, although I didn't know it was actually called that.   People will only play one chracter at a time, but there is nothing in the rules of sanctum that say this has to follow suit in anyone else's game.  NPC's will be a part of this pool.                        </div>

<i>Everyone in the given city, from the moment they awake, or the moment they stumble out of their home realize that they aren't really home after all.

                            My name and my project are 12+ years old, so not too worried.   the entire name is Sanctum: The Fallout, and from what I see, no one but myself has taken it.   I call it Sanctum without fallout only for reference when I'm being lazy.    The name has a huge relevence to the theme.<br/>

Yes, No and Yes.     The fact that they were living one life yesterday and now suddenly have been thrown into this one is an absolute, but not the other things.<br/><br/>Who is to say that they have been transported through space and time?   Perhaps it is all a dream, or perhaps they are in a man-built refugee on earth.   Perhaps their memories are altered and they are living a lie right now.   All of THOSE factors are up to the GM/ST. <br/>
<blockquote>Or is the idea that each of these cities has been running for awhile, so that you now have unique cultures and interactions based on this thematic grouping? Are we at the beginning of the Riverworld books or the end of them?</blockquote>
All of these factors are based on GM/ST's choice, not Sanctum.    Sanctum does not even demand that there be more than one city at all.     As for Riverworld's ending or beginning, I'm not sure I've even read those so have no way of answering that part.   Where you start in Sanctum is also up to the GM/ST.   In my play test, we are starting out on Day 1.    Some people might want to start before Day 1, or perhaps several years after.   That's their choice...and it's their world.

The extreme open-endedness is exactly what I had to train myself into when writing Sanctum, but it's not as hard as you'd think.   You are calling it a lack of character structure, I am calling it "making you figure out for yourself who your character is and what they want."  Instead of telling you what you should play, or how you should play it.<br/><br/>I'd be inclined to think that it gives you more, not less character structure to build those answers, and it's those sort of questions you need to ask when you make your character...especially since you make your character with this knowledge ahead of time.    Maybe having a taste of being the underdog, your character wants to BE the mob-boss...and so intends to try doing that in this new life.<br/><br/>What is to stop you from having detailed back-stories?   There are NPC's after all, not to mention that since time is not absolutely linear in this game, you could very well could have scenes of 'before sanctum', which would serve to enrichen your character's development.   There is nothing in the rules that say people absolutely cannot know each other; it's up to GM/ST's approval, not Sanctum's.   (and most GM's ask their players what they want in a game)<br/><br/>But, I've already thought ahead of of this and know that some people are used to this information being provided...So I shall provide plenty of demo's in my book!<br/><br/>Any other questions?

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shutupgirl</cite>I'd be inclined to think that it gives you more, not less character structure to build those answers</blockquote>
Hmm, I get the feeling we're not understanding each other. Could you give some examples of the kind of structure Sanctum provides to help players build their characters?<br/><br/>So you have an idea of what I mean, a good example so far is the idea that each city has some sort of theme to which its entire population adheres. So whatever the players decide on for the theme (i.e. 'everyone in the city is a spy', 'everyone in the city is a supernatural monster', 'everyone in the city has committed a terrible Christian sin') is going to provide some structure for the characters: they have to be a spy, a supernatural monster, etc. That's the sort of structure I'm talking about.
<blockquote>The extreme open-endedness is exactly what I had to train myself into when writing Sanctum, but it's not as hard as you'd think. You are calling it a lack of character structure, I am calling it "making you figure out for yourself who your character is and what they want." Instead of telling you what you should play, or how you should play it.</blockquote>
I agree that we are calling one thing by different names -- but I'm not sure why your version is any less problematic. What I'm suggesting is that 'do whatever you want, anything at all' is as paralyzing as it is liberating. Making players come up with absolutely everything about their characters, with no guidance from a system or from a game text or from a setting is asking a lot. I don't think it's that hard, I'm just not sure I see the advantage. Personally, as a player, I'd like to play a game that either a) provides some focus for me or b) provides me with tools for creating that focus. I'm curious if Sanctum will be doing b), since a) is clearly not a goal. 
<blockquote>What is to stop you from having detailed back-stories?</blockquote>
I didn't mean to say that characters could not have detailed back-stories -- what I was suggesting was that, if the characters were now on 'Day 1', suddenly somewhere else, those backstories would be providing structure in an unfamiliar way, and possibly less inspiration/input overall. The NPCs from your backstory, for example, would be unlikely to still be around. Power structures and relationships would similarly be concretely absent. As you point out they could still have a strong influence on the character, in ways that would not require physical presence.
<blockquote>There are NPC's after all, not to mention that since time is not absolutely linear in this game, you could very well could have scenes of 'before sanctum', which would serve to enrichen your character's development.   There is nothing in the rules that say people absolutely cannot know each other; it's up to GM/ST's approval, not Sanctum's.   (and most GM's ask their players what they want in a game)</blockquote>
I may have missed the part where non-linearity was introduced. That definitely sounds cool, and I can certainly see a lot of players wanting to focus on developing their backstories (TV-wise, Lost has this structure, more or less) as they progress through the game. But in general "there is nothing in the rules that says you can't" has only a very tenuous connection to "players will actually do so." <br/><br/>Part of what I'm curious about is what it is about the 'core' of Sanctum that seems really cool to you -- what about it is going to make all these games recognizeable as the same thing? What sort of structures or themes or whatever are going to be present in all the games, in your view? Right now, the one element I see that will be present in all games is this idea of a city whose inhabitants are all 'alike' in a generalised/abstract way. Is there more that I am not seeing?                        </div>

                            Easy question first.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite>Sara,<br/><br/>After thinking about this for a while, I'm unsure about what exactly I'd be buying if I bought your product. If you leave it as wide open as you indicated, what are you providing me as a player? </blockquote>
Because I'm going a step further.   If you read the mock index, I provide not just my premise, but intend to demonstrate the different ways to play it, including how to modify it and how to set scenes.<br/><br/>misuba says it best by saying that I'm essentially not just giving a system for world creation, a very SPECIFIC world scenerio, but that I'm more or less teaching players/GM's/ST's how to navigate, create, variate and twist this world into several different things, all without changing the original premise.   I'm also going to be cross-promoting with my world by incorporating different systems into world to demonstrate what sort of playstyles those systems encourage; which helps people figure out what they want out of the game in the first place.<br/><br/>So in my book, there will be a blurb that modifies this 'setting' into A Larp setting, (in which case is Ends and Means), but there will also be blurbs about the dice variation, the card variation, (perhaps with of pretty cards, who knows), and every other possible scenerio, including the theater.<br/><br/>Sanctum is my creation, the only difference between this game and other games is that I am not glueing my world to a single system and a single plot and saying that's the complete game.<br/><br/>I can change the system on a whim, alter the motives of the world on a whim, (from anything from not planning a single thing and seeing what happens, right down to plotting the last detail and railroading people down a course of events that will happen with or without them)<br/><br/>But you are right, some people do want things set out for them that way; and that's why I'll be attatching my world to different systems so that people can play them out that way, including with storyline suggestions, plot guides and potential focus areas, including how to get the game headed in a certain direction.<br/><br/><br/>This beta?   I'm testing my game in the most extreme way possible...by doing what some here say is NOT possible.<br/><br/>They are going in with nothing more than that phamplet and the ideas that they comprise out of thier own heads.<br/>(Note that most of the plot comes from a system...mine doesn't guide this, so it DEPENDS ON THE SYSTEM!)<br/><br/>We are going to throw them in this world and see how much they can do without a storyteller...and how much work we actually need to do, how much planning we need to have and if we even have to do any actual work at all, or if they just run with everything themselves.<br/><br/>We're putting trust in the player...I think the hardest part for storytellers is running a game and then realizing that if it weren't for all the demands of a system that demands you babysit the players and spoon feed them the plot... that they don't need you after all.<br/><br/>So, some say it won't work.   I say, let's let the beta testing do the talking <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I am at this point, calling it a "Multi-Format RPG"   Because that's what they are going to be getting when they read through it, and take their pick of how they want the game to run.   *consider it almost like customizing the extras you want in a car, and then getting to pick the color of the paint*   The book starts with the core idea, then it step by step gives you ways to customize and add, gloss on some paint, put in some detailing, or just take it bare bones and go nuts developing your own system, and seeing all of the crazy ways it can turn out.<br/><br/>For people who focus on Character development more than plot, this can be played over and over again in different ways...for people who love plot, it can be modified and adapted so that it's never even close to the same game, even though it is the same exact core.    If you are a person who likes Rifts because everything, right down to the bullets in your gun have a stat and you get to roll for it; then my book might not be as great for you until someone adapts my world to a setting that is rule heavy.   (which would work but I won't include that version in my book!)<br/><br/>And you could take my setting and adapt it to your game...but then won't people just point and go...hey...look, Sanctum can be played as a ?    -That's my goal by the time I'm done with this book; making everyone want to play this idea, infatuated with all of the different potential plotlines and scenerio's that I will tease them with, so that they will either try one of the systems that I mention or demonstrate with, (all independent ones!)  Or modify the game to work with thier own system.<br/><br/>I could read someone's book and then not have to buy it because I remember how to play it...but I won't be able to say it was all my idea;   Same difference.<br/><br/>Think of it this way; how many people have modified a game so that they can play it with X amount of people because technically, it doesn't work unless Y amount Play?    -Sanctum will demonstrate how to modify things so that they work to create story OR plot, no matter what system you use.   That's what makes it different-                        </div>

                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>In the beta game, we are also implementing a "Never say No" Rule.     We, as storytellers, will NEVER say no.  We might say, your chances are next to nothing, here are your odds but never no.<br/><br/>So what happens when they succeed at something you aren't ready for?<br/><br/>Mwhaha...I'm going to make you read the beta test to find that one out <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>And IceCream,<br/><br/>I think I answered most of your questions at the same time with the above post.  (I had to split it up, since my post was 'too long' <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>  You are suggesting that the game, even with Ends and Means doesn't offer a way to customize characters because it doesn't give direction.    I think the below comment will handle this!
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite><br/>What I'm suggesting is that 'do whatever you want, anything at all' is as paralyzing as it is liberating. Making players come up with absolutely everything about their characters, with no guidance from a system or from a game text or from a setting is asking a lot. I don't think it's that hard, I'm just not sure I see the advantage.<br/></blockquote>
This is up to the -system- that is being used, which is why I'm going to be careful with demonstrating how the world and the system mesh together, so that you can not run into such a problem.<br/><br/>People making characters with Ends and Means come up with the perfect LARP Characters for Sanctum, because Ends and Means provides for those missing things.     You would need a few different elements though for a dice game, and quite a few different if you were doing Theater RPG.<br/><br/>This is why I'll explanining and demonstrating how to not only run a game on different systems, but how to make characters, drive plot focus or encourage player creation and character driven plot.<br/><br/>People who love to mod can have a field day, people who want to try something new will have a few ideas on how to do it, while people who have no clue at all of how to game, but desperately want to...can all get something out of the same product.       The reason why I'm keeping Sanctum down to a mere few pages is because it's sort of a read as you go product.   I'd like to think that someone wanting to modify the  world setting is going to have the decency to buy the book, or at least show it off; while those who need that little bit 'more', will get it...and those who need 'a bit more' will get it...until at the end of the book, even a complete newbie could figure out how to run not only one game, but at least five different versions of it.<br/><br/>I know that I'm going against the grain here by supporting the idea that you don't need a book to tell you how to micromanage the creation of your own game...but I think it's doable.<br/><br/>I have no intentions to write a book telling people how much damage a bullet from a heavy pistol does per round just so that people have to follow that book in order to play (when we all know that people make house rules and bastardize the content anyways)<br/><br/>I could create several entire worlds at the drop of a hat, and an NPC cast to support it...but why limit the world when I can just make a few sample suggestions instead and spark the idea in someone's head to use or not use such a suggestion in their own world?<br/><br/>I'm just skipping a few steps and cheerleading the process of modding.   In fact, as far as I'm concerned, if you can't figure out how to mod it to your system, I'll HELP you mod it...(as long as you buy the book, or playtest my world!)<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>Speaking of which...<br/><br/>If you want to beta-test Sanctum on your own system, feel free to drop me a whisper.<br/><br/>Adam Cerling and his Ends and Means system gets my first priorty, but I AM looking to playtest other methods.                        </div>

                            So it's now and only now that I'll admit that my original setting was actually a complete game since I had first designed it with die system...D20 to be exact, rolled with d10, d12's and d6's.<br/><br/>Then, after being fascinated with Adam Cerling's LARP system, I modified it. I was going to just package it that way but everytime I would start finalizing an idea for plot, I'd realize that Ends and Means works better when it is allowed to be guided by players instead of railroaded and pre-written. This made me re-think the way I wrote the world and how much detail I insisted had to pre-exist.<br/><br/>So instead, I'm going and try and sell the idea instead. The idea of a adaptable setting that is only limited by where you want it to go. Need it written for you? I can provide that, but what about this twist...and that twist...or what if it were this way? Or that way?<br/><br/>That's what I'm going to attempt to provoke, so that while people CAN play something a set way with controlled settings included...I'm going to dare them NOT to. Call it daring the reader to deviate from the original plan and go wild with their own story. As long as the core pieces, the things I dub Sanctum: the Fallout remain, then it doesn't matter how the world is tweaked, modified, written, NPC'ed, Historied...it's Sanctum.<br/><br/>There are just suddenly several different versions, stories and possiblities instead of one plot course and several ways to get there.<br/><br/>And isn't that what roleplaying is all about? Or is it always about that "Winning"?<br/><br/>..."winning" is possible in this system too, but I intend to show that you don't have to "Win" in order to roleplay.<br/><br/>Does it make sense, or should I try again in the morning?                        </div>

                            Interesting stuff, so first a note:  If you only lost 13% on a rewrite, that's not bad at all.  I've had to go back to zero and build back up from scratch enough times that I can promise it could be much, much worse.<br/><br/>This is, at least so far as I've been able to piece together, pretty ambitious, and I'm very pleased you decided to open up a little more about the specifics. It's very normal to be concerned that someone's going to steal the idea you've been busting your ass on, or that some know-it-all is going to try to 'fix" it, but the payoff in clarity and meaningful feedback is (to my mind) well worth it, so bravo.<br/><br/>As such, I've got two questions for you, which I'd be very curious to hear about.<br/><br/>First, I'm curious what games you've looked at that have helped give you ideas for this, if any. In fact, I'm very curious if there are other games you've looked at and decided "No, not quite what I need."  I am, in short, looking to understand how you view the context of this game.<br/><br/>The second question is both for my own edification and because I've found answering it to be a useful tool:  What's your elevator pitch?  That is to say, if you only have a few moments of attention, and want to pitch your game in 4 sentences or less in such a way that you hit upon what makes it cool _and_ what makes it distinct from other games, what would you say?<br/><br/>In any case, good luck with this, It sounds like an intriguing project.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Sara, <br/><br/>A few questions:<br/><br/>What defines the set of games you'd call Sanctum games? Obviously its not system, or precisely setting - as the details are so variable. Perhaps the initial situation of the game? Some reinforcements along the way? A certain mood or thematic element? This may be a fuzzy category, perhaps a Sanctum game isn't something that you can define, so much as classify when you see it. In any case, a short list of things you expect in a group playing Sanctum would make things clearer.<br/><br/>Second, how do you intend your game text to encourage play so that it meets these expectations? This is the induction problem I've mentioned earlier. What makes your text influence the game differently than, for example, a novel being used as the source material for the game? <br/><br/>I have several competing ideas of what the Sanctum product is, I'm trying to get a firmer bead on it. <br/><br/>And if it acts as a carrot, I'm sufficiently intrigued by the project to consider trying it with <a href="http://wyrmwood.srgames.org/RPGs/24hour/Savagery.pdf" rel="nofollow">Savagery</a> (pdf), although I'm still not sure that they would work well together.<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>

                            (a three-parter, because of length!)<br/><br/>I have a very limited experience with gaming...and part of that reason is what I'm addressing in this book.<br/><br/>The first experience I had with gaming was hearing about DnD when I was about 10.  (About the same time I started reading DragonLance)  I SO badly wanted to play...but there was no one to play with.   It's one of those games where someone trying to learn the system so they can join a game has alot of trouble because you almost have to play it to understand how it works.  (For me anyways, since I'm a very visual person and math isn't my best subject.)<br/><br/>I borrowed a book and "tried" to learn that way, but it doesn't really tell you WHAT to do, as much as assume you already know how to play and you just need statistics.  (Am I the only one who notices this in alot of RPG books?)     Because everything is laid out in way of statistics before telling you what to do with it, it's confusing as hell and when you go to play it, still doesn't work the way you think it would.<br/><br/>So I bought the Board game version in 1991.  (age 11)  (Don't laugh...I couldn't have been the only loser to do it!  And for note, it wasn't even the neat one with figurines...the player pieces were those little paper triangles you had to assemble...*sigh*)<br/><br/>Since I wasn't capeable of joining a game since I still didn't really know HOW you played, even if I knew alot of the game mechanics, I didn't get to play...period.<br/><br/>So, I started writing my own game, my own world with rules that made more sense to me, because that way maybe I could get some of my friends to play it... (I tried to get them into DnD but we were all just confused by the books and couldn't really figure out the 'right' way to play.<br/><br/>I added a ridiculous amount of statistics to Sanctum, and it was a solid, complete world, even with NPC's, A storyline and different realities.   I used D20's for success rolls but mostly for random encounters, D10 for "Quality of Sucess" rolls and D6 for multiplyers, Damage, Healing, etc.  There were other things, but eh...that's another story.<br/><br/>So, you could say that I was just an Eleven Year old who figured if someone made an entire world (DnD), then I could too...and so did, as it's not like I had anything better to do.<br/><br/>And then, although I never lost interest in games, I would add things here and there but I gave up on trying to game and just gave in to comic books...at least those I could find...and people who liked to game, I could not!    Sanctum, the only name I had for it until I was 13, was finished but I didn't know what to do with it, so I just let it sit there.<br/><br/>So, then, when I was Nineteen, I finally found a friend who let me in on his group.   I was rusty...but estatic, I went and bought dice, bought books, and was sure that by reading the book, I could play the game...right?  (hell no!)   But that's okay, because they slowly, and painfully taught me how to play.   I think my biggest problem with perhaps this group, or was it the game?  Was that everything was guided along on a little path that just had obstacles in the way.  (Dont' get me wrong, this is fun...)  But it had very little to do with the characters you spent hours making and putting thought into so you could roleplay them 'the right way',  Sure, an outcome might be different or we might affect the world and the plot a bit...but in the end, it was just gaming your way through a pre-set story that the DM had worked out in detail, including hit points and abilities for every mob, where the mobs were, and the reward and treasure we'd find.   (again...not that it isn't fun...but everything was always railroaded.   If the makers of DnD and fans wouldn't Gut me for suggesting it, Id' be more than happy to steal the world and insist that "Anything Goes", making it almost a free-form style of roleplay)<br/><br/>So, *coughs*  Anyhow, back on track...  This group then played Star Wars...which I determined really is the same damn thing but with star wars instead of DnD.  I got sick of the dice rolling to do anything.     ...then they shifted to Rifts...and I ran like hell.                        </div>

                            Part two of three<br/>(for Rifts?) While the idea of having EVERYTHING handed to you and described on a silver platter with tons of books sounded awesome at first, it just made me realize how micromanaged someone decided to make a game, just so they could sell more content on telling you what to do so that you could point at a book and say, "It's not in the book...or, Let me check the stats first"     By this time, I had started Larping...and liking it more than the tabletop, because at least with the Larp I could evolve my character, even if no one else gave a damn about it.  I played in an independent Camarilla game and I enjoyed that the Storytellers just sometimes ignored content to make the story interesting.  (of course, some people bitched because "that's not in the book!")  Character development actually mattered to some extent and most of the plot actually WAS player based...The ST's enforced this.   So there was a system, but it was a modified MET.   Mass Combat still sucked and you still had to do chops all the time, but at least it had some content...(which I didn't always find when I started playing OWBN Cam game)<br/><br/>Statistics... (this became my primary irritation at MET)    It seems everywhere I go, everything was micromanaged.   Win this Chop, Earn this Exp so that you can buy this.  It doesn't matter if your character SHOULD start out with, you start with these...  Well, you have two spare traits for the gun but you are down one heavy trait, but you do have the feat "blah" and so this makes you...<br/><br/>...Seriously...How many people do you see get EXCITED at Mass Combat?   ...Why does everything have to be nit-picked to death?    So, I became convinced that gamers are programmed to follow rules, and learn that being micromanaged is roleplaying and that's roleplay....the rest is just story.<br/><br/>I accepted this, and just played anyways, trying my best to avoid anything that made me throw chops, or have to look at my character sheet.   (Garou Nations, Garou Game is one such LARP)   <br/><br/>Then I tried Adam Cerling's "Ends and Means" and while I couldn't see how it would work at first...It goes against everything that "gaming" teaches you. The first few questions in my head were "What do you mean we figure out who wins their stake BEFORE we figure out everything that happens?"   The thought that you could simply decide who wins OOCLY with a few phrases instead of a twenty minute chop session or rolling all sorts of dice made no sense to me...  Use a system to figure out the outcome and THEN narrate what happens?   It broke my brain...<br/><br/>I then realized that maybe it wasn't my brain that was broken, maybe it was the system.<br/><br/>He's either going to get an Ego, or sick of me saying this, but Adam is a freaking Genius.    <br/><br/>And so, although my experience is limited to Vampire, Garou, Indi-MET Games, Star Wars,  DnD, Rifts, Changeling, Pool and PrimeTime Adventures (the last two are recent), I know what I want in a game..and I think that there are ALOT of 'would be' Gamers out there, if only there was something that wasn't so hard to break into.   As it is, most of the games that I know, or have seen almost require that someone who already knows the system or has a wonderful grasp at various sorts of gaming has to bring the person in and walk them through it...Which means there are plenty of people, just like when I was a kidlet, who would love to game, but just simply don't have any idea where to begin.<br/><br/>...we all RPG as children, we just don't have rules.   We make them up as we go along, and often argue what is 'fair game' and what isn't.   What I'd like to do is take that fascination and move it one step ahead.   The Mod-happy people can go to town turning it as intricate and complicated as they want, while others can play this game and not feel as if they are 'not playing it right' just because it says you have to do it this way in the book.<br/><br/>...Sad as it sounds, people seem to need a stamp of approval by some book before they think it's okay.    My book is giving out the stamp, without demanding that there is only one right way.    Make sense?                        </div>

                            Part Three of Three: Elevator Pitch<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>"What's Sanctum?"<br/><br/>Imagine that you wake up tomorrow, walk outside to get the morning paper and you open the door to see a street you have never seen before in your life...Shut the Door and take a moment to let what you just saw sink in.   Now, open the door again and try and make sense of what you see.  If you shut the door again, you can stay inside for as long as you like and try and pretend what you saw isn't real; but can you keep 'out there' from coming in?   Others are already starting to realize that no matter what they used to be, or how they used to live, has been replaced with this new existance.   A city that seems to be something similar to what you would get if you took a little bit of everything from everyone and tried to make just one machine with all of those parts...Your past is a memory, this is your future.<br/><br/>Sanctum, is figuring out what happens next.    You can start with this first day, you can start with five years from now, or you can even start with how life was BEFORE Sanctum...but this is your life now, what happens next?<br/><br/>.....Is the old world gone?......<br/><br/>Do you want it to be?  The details are up to the players and to the storytellers.   There's no right or wrong answer, unless you want there to be one.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~and I'm sure other questions will follow...but you get the gist~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                        </div>

                            Here's my draft about Sanctum from the book.       It's really that simple...Everything else in the book is me telling people what they can do with it, what systems will HELP them do it, and what kind of system is right for the type of play they are looking for, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The World of Sanctum: Starting out.<br/><br/><br/>The world of Sanctum is as simple or as complicated as it is made to be.   Sanctum itself is a modify-it-yourself setting that follows a few simple rules.   As long as you follow these rules, you are playing Sanctumâ€¦Deviate, and you are not.   Once you have these conditions met, The world is your own.  Break it, Bend it, Guide it, Plot it...there ARE no rules to what you can or can't do with Sanctum: the Fallout, unless you decide you want it that way.   I'm not going to tell you "No, it doesn't exist, or No, it has to follow this fate"  <br/><br/>â€¢	The world consists of cities.   The number, type and size of these cities are not determined until you determine them.   The gameâ€™s focus usually begins with focus on a single city, and this is the city that your player characters exist in.  There is nothing that says you must create more than one city, and there is nothing to say that you cannot create several hundred; do what is best for your own game.<br/><br/>â€¢	Each City has a theme.   Decide what that theme is, and then create the characters.  It could be a theme as simple as â€œEveryone is from New York but from different periods of time.â€, From the elaborate â€œEveryone is an ordinary human from random places on earth, are from different points in time and all were in the process of dying in a catastrophic eventâ€   Itâ€™s your worldâ€¦choose it, or better yet, let the players decide what kind of world they want to experience.<br/><br/>â€¢	The cities of Sanctum are defined by the people who occupy them; this is important.   The city is what you get when you take elements from everyone and everything that occupy your characterâ€™s familiarity and mix them all together.   If you took two purebred dogs and bred them together, youâ€™d get a muttâ€¦this is exactly what you are doing with the city.   The city is the result of all of those elements trying to merge together, or co-exist.   Nothing says that you have to include all of those elements, but nothing says you canâ€™t try!<br/><br/>â€¢	Each city is Unique.   It does not matter what theme is devised, or how many cities you have, but each city is absolutely Unique.   If one city is ordinary humans from the planet earth, there must be a fundamental difference in the next city.   It can be as small as that everyone in a particular city is a child, or as large as every person who exists is actually a fictional storybook character who is not only real, but lived out their lives just the same as anyone else.  (can you imagine the shock THEY must have had the morning after they woke?) <br/><br/>â€¢	Each city stands alone.   Regardless of how long it takes to get to another city, the method of getting there, or how easy or difficult it is to get to another place, each city is essentially alone, or holds the appearance of being that way.  Perhaps there is a glass mirror or wall that is an illusion and that a hallway to another city exists through that mirror, or there could be a portal that opens every sunrise to allow people passageway, but each city should act almost as if it were itâ€™s own world.   Whatever reasons you create for explaining it, abusing it or using it are up to you, as long as it exists.<br/><br/>â€¢	The city started on the same day.   It doesnâ€™t matter if someone doesnâ€™t remember it, overslept that day or simply didnâ€™t realize anything had changed because they were too busy hiding in their closet; Sanctum began at the same time for everyone in that city.   This does not mean the game has to start on the same day as Sanctumâ€™s creation; you can start before, or even well after, but as far as the storyline goes, there was a single day that it all â€˜happenedâ€™.                        </div>

                            That entirely makes sense, though in a brief moment of defense - yes, you can get excited about mass combat.  It's all a matter of what you want out of it and a question of whether the game delivers.  That however, is a gigantic tangent, and delves deep into the land of war stories.<br/><br/>Now, that said, I have an even more impertinent question:  What _don't_ you think this game can do well?<br/><br/>It's possible the answer is "Nothing, so long as you're willing to do a little work"  or that the answer list is very small and possibly trivial - that often is the answer.  But if that is the case, I just want to toss up a flare that that is a really problematic answer.<br/><br/>It's non intuitive, I know, but if that's the case, there's a danger of running afoul of two principles:<br/><br/>1. Constraint breeds creativity.  <br/><br/>2. It is better to be loved <b>and</b> hated than universally ok.<br/><br/>Both of these are potentially contentious points, but they underscore the necessity of figuring out what a game shouldn't do.  If it does everything, <br/>then it provides no real impetus for inspiration because there's nothing to push against.  Similarly, if one game does everything and another does something specific, it totally makes sense for me as a play to choose the specialist, and there are a lot of choice in specialists out there, and the field for games that do everything is pretty crowded.<br/><br/>All of which is me underscoring why a question that might be considered snarky is really quite serious indeed. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I admit, I've gotten excited over Mass Combat...but it's not so fun after the first twenty minutes for me...I'd rather be back to the story!  (which is why I like PTA, Pool and Ends and Means so much!)
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite>Ok, because it could be quite uncomfortable, how do you feel about very pointed questions being directed at this?</blockquote>
Go for it.   If you can  break it, it's my job to fix it.   God knows I had to go through alot of bandaids when I first started adapting it.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rob Donoghue</cite><br/>Now, that said, I have an even more impertinent question: What _don't_ you think this game can do well?</blockquote>
Make everyone happy without adding directions.   (But I think I cover this because I start out with no directions, and then throw them in for people who just absolutely need them...This way, the people who don't, aren't bogged down with restrictions while those who need them, can find them)<br/><br/>I could very easily write several informational books that tell everyone exactly what Sanctum is...including the people, the characters, different elements...I could take a system and make classes, and turn everything into a pre-set arrangement.    Then I could go ahead and do the same thing in a completely different 'version', and then do it again...and again...and again.   (Or I could have other people ask me to do it and I just let them, so that people who want Sanctum as a structured world can play 'versions' of Sanctum that are laid out the way they want)<br/><br/>But, since one of my main ideas is trying to goad people into more free-formed RPG's, I don't do this to begin with.   I start with the looser formed RPG's and I then break it down into how to turn it into a fact-natzi game.    (would I want to play a fact-natzi game?  Not really, but I can just ignore this section and read the ones that apply to me)<br/><br/>You could almost call it a bunch of "What If's".     Sure, it's more work...but I don't mind the challenge.
<blockquote><br/>It's non intuitive, I know, but if that's the case, there's a danger of running afoul of two principles:<br/><br/>1. Constraint breeds creativity.<br/><br/>2. It is better to be loved<b>and</b>hated than universally ok.<br/></blockquote>
Call me ambitious but I intend to breed creativity by making suggestions that get the mind going in one direction and then suggesting that it doesn't have to be that way...by suggesting that it could also go this direction...or this direction...or this direction...and hopefully by this time, they are already getting their own ideas on how this world is going to end up, or how it got that way.  (We've all watched something or another and thought "I'd have done it this way instead..." ...I'm just goading them into doing it, instead of convincing them they shouldn't try)<br/><br/>As for loved and Hated...my setting rocks in my own eyes and I just consider it a kudo's that alot of other people -really- want to play in this world.  (including people who tell me how bummed they are because they don't think they can make it but could I please tell them all about it, or post it somewhere so they can see?)<br/><br/>Some may hate this book/game/setting because it doesn't just have one uniform way to play...and I'm okay with this too.<br/><br/>My goal?  Get people so interested in this concept that people WANT to create their own Sanctum: The Fallout...                        </div>

                            Ok, cool, so back to the pitch, as I think this is the rub.<br/><br/>If that was all I knew about the game my first question would be "OK, so this is a game where I can go back inside and hide?" which would ultimately be an expression of "That's kind of an interesting backdrop, but what am I going to _do_?"<br/><br/>If the answer is "Whatever you want!" then that is, a total beartrap, because the next question is "Ok, so why this, and not Gurps or Hero Or Nobilis or Amber or some other game where I have a similar range of possibilities?"<br/><br/>That pitch is nicely flavorful, but I don't walk away with even an inkling of what's going to be going down at the table or Larp or whatever - it's a good pitch for a specific game, such as at a convention, but it doesn't tell me anything about the product and what it's going to do to make things rock for me.  In fact, given that pitch, i would assume it's a "play yourself in a weird situation" game, which is (I believe) just incorrect.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - So this inspires a question of who you feel you're pitching to.  It sounds like many of the decisions you leave in the player's hands (theme and rules) are very empowering, but they also seem the sort of decisions that work better for someone who has a lot more experience with systems (so they have a range to make a choice from) and that seems a contradiction with what seems to be designed to be a very open game. What am I missing?                        </div>

                            It really does matter who I'm pitching to.    Most of the people I pitch that line are to are players, and so far they've all fallen for it.  (in a good way, since that means they want to play!   People CAN choose to play themselves..but in my experience, the first thing anyone does when they start roleplaying is that they make a character in their head and start roleplaying as if they were them.  If they don't, all they need is the reminder that they can...)<br/><br/>It's perfect logic that people are going to want some direction if they've never played before and really want some guidance, so that's what storytellers are for...<br/><br/>First question I'd ask is, "Which game system do you prefer?  Tabletop?  Larp?"  (most aren't going to say Theater from my experience)<br/><br/>So, let's say it's a tabletop.   The conversation could go like...<br/><br/>"player A: I'm hiding...where do I hide?"<br/><br/>GM: "There's always the closet...it's your home after all, but who knows, maybe you'd rather hang out in the basement..."<br/><br/>Player A:  "Screw it, the closet is closer."<br/><br/>GM: It's pretty dark....and it kinda smells like shoes.<br/><br/>Player A:  No way, I used fresher in my shoes, it wouldn't smell like Shoes.<br/><br/>Gm: Okay, it smells like freshener...How long are you going to wait there?<br/><br/>Player A: I'm not coming out until someone makes me!<br/><br/>(Let's assume other players aren't exploring all these strange new buildings, looking for friends or family, or trying to steal anything that isn't bolted down..he's still in the closet)<br/><br/>GM: It's been awhile now, nothing seems to be happening...you don't even hear any screaming.<br/><br/>Player A: I'm torn between feeling silly and being scared out of my wits...but I AM hungry by now...<br/><br/>GM: Unless you forgot to go shopping, your kitchen should still have something to eat.<br/><br/>Player A: ...There's always Ramen...<br/><br/>GM: So, you're going to the kitchn then?<br/><br/>Player A: Yeah.  I'm not going outside yet...maybe if I just stay inside, I can pretend I'm not crazy."<br/><br/>Gm: So you think you're crazy?<br/><br/>Player A: After what I just saw?  A little bit...but I'm sure food will help.<br/><br/>GM: There's someone in your kitchen...they're eating your last package of ramen.<br/><br/>Player A: I would have heard them come in!<br/><br/>GM: okay, you're in the closet...someone's opened your door and you hear some footsteps go down the hallway.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>In other words, I'd just jump into the conversation as if they had started roleplaying with me...   you don't need a conflict resolution system to get that far...<br/><br/>So, does that make sense?<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>As for developers?  I'd probally pitch it more geared with ending with:<br/><br/>"Then, depending on what kind of game you want to run, you just decide how you are going to mess with your players today."<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"Depending on what system you want to run it with, you just modify it into the equation and run with it"<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>"So, instead of *blah* concept in *blah* world, it's in this one, so there are all those other factors to play on; and you can customize it the way you want to run your game"<br/><br/>Most people have a very specific idea of what they are looking for when they are asking questions...so it depends on the questions, and who I'm pitching to.   I talk adaptability and how it could adapt or work with someone's system if that's what they are looking for, or if someone is looking for an engine, I could suggest a few and then show them how Sanctum: The Fallout would work if it was modded to that system.<br/><br/>But, I'd also be making suggestions as far as the different things that could be done....going off on a tangent like.<br/><br/>"It all depends on where you want to take it, or where you think you want to bring your players.  You could run a plot based on the circumstances that brought everyone together, you could create some crisis for people to deal with."  And just generally prod the "What would you make the answer be?" questions.   The good part about this, is alot of developers already have some themes...so I'd like to think they're already asking those questions and know what they want before I have to poke them with it" <br/><br/>Then prompt them into some <br/><br/>Let me know if I'm not clear enough; explaining things is still new for me <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            It makes sense, but here's the question: Why would I want to play that example? Ramen and doing nothing doesn't seem like a fun use of my time.<br/><br/>As I see it, you've got a situation to throw characters into (Your environment has changed*) and no mechanical agenda (Use any ruleset), and that's cool, but I see no impetus.  Look at your example - nothing interesting happens until the GM decides "Screw it, this is boring, I'm throwing injas at this guy" or whatever.  So if I'm that GM, how does Sanctum help me a) realize I need to do somehtign more compelling than discuss Ramen until I've _forced_ the player to take action and b) realize _what_ should be opening that door (Ninjas? Smurfs? Amway salesmen? Aliens?).<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>* Notably, as framed you've also created what really very much feels like a horror scenario, which is cool, but is that what you want?                        </div>

                            It all depends on the players.<br/><br/>Some players are wallflowers who have to have things thrown at them, some players are so determined to do things that they'll drag you along for the ride.<br/><br/>I don't think it has to do with the game, as much as what sort of player starts playing it.<br/><br/>The impetus depends on what system you use...once again, it really all comes down to HOW you play it, which means, the system is going to be giving that missing element.   And that's what I think is neat about it.<br/><br/>The very same player could have run out into the streets and tried to start a riot by screaming out that it's the end of the world just as same as hiding in the closet...  <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                        </div>

Sure, but you're designing something, so that's what I'm speaking to.  If we talk about Bob the GM, he's going to have answers for these questions, based on Angie the player, no problem, but is the game they're playing helping with that?<br/><br/>If this was D&amp;D, all mechanics aside, the player has at least one implicit goal (Get stuff, get powerful) so I can say "The game helps direct play in this fashion".  If the game was set in a world of Zombie Apocalypse, the player woudl have an implicit "Don't get eaten" goal.  These goals will (hopefully) not be the only goals, but in each setup, the GM has been given certain tools to make the game about something, and these goals are a good exampel of that.<br/><br/>So far I sense that sanctum will have a lot of examples and suggestions, and I'm not devaluing that at _all_  - RPGs need more of this.  But that's a formula for a good GM advice book, and I think you want this to be more than just that, so as a game to play, what tools is sanctum going to be giving me?<br/><br/>And, by the way, if I seem to be coming down to hard, I apologize and will cheerily back off. I think you have a really great core of an idea here, but there are parts to it I'm clearly not seeing, and am trying to pin down.  <br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            by all means, fire away.   I'll just get better at explaining <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Sanctum is going to attept to show that there is more than one way to roleplay the same game.<br/><br/>Because Sanctum doesn't start out rule heavy with so many absolutes, it allows people the opportunity to say "Hey, lets play it this way"  Or even for the GM to just show up at a game with nothing planned at all and just improv the hell out of everything.   Sanctum is giving you the hammer and nails, and then by showing what kind of building you get if you follow a certain set of instructions.<br/><br/>For some players, it's going to be...Hey, can you run this game?   Some players may be "I want to run my own version of this game!"<br/><br/>Most people already have a system they favor, and alot of people I know tend to throw an RPG at a good storytelling type and beg them to run a game...even if they themselves no absolutely nothing about it, or how to run it...or make it run.<br/><br/>Sanctum, is giving you, the player, a chance to explore a unique world that doesn't demand you know everything about it in order to play it well <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And, as an added bonus...because it isn't glued to just one system, this gives the ST/GM a chance to pull a fast one on the players and make them experience an entirely new system.<br/><br/>Sanctum is almost a game that you start first WITH the system, sot that you know how to play...and then you figure out the rest, by letting it fall, or be guided into place.                        </div>

                            Ok one question<br/>
Why cant I just go grab another copy of The Window or grab up my pdf of Fuzion and just decide a theme, or group decide a theme for the city, and just play. That is what I am not figuring out and I suspect it is because we have such utterly different experiences in gaming as to be almost talking different languages or living on separate planets. <br/>
<br/>
I guess I dont see that there is a right way or a wrong way to play Role Playing Games. It is just what comes out of the people you game with. <br/>
The rules, be they DnD, ADnD, 3.0/3.5/d20Modern/Hero System/Fuzion/Interlock/Original Traveller/Dark Conspiracy/Twilight 2000/Kult/GURPS/Shadowrun all editions/Palladium/Whatever all they really do are be nuts and bolts to hold it all together. The real gaming consists of the interactive storytelling that goes on between the people playing, be it me running a game and my best friend Doug or Colin running a game with 5 of his best friends where they all live. The rules are just there to be a skeleton. If you dont like that arm, ignore it, change it, just live with it. But the rules are not gaming, the people playing are the gaming elements. <br/>
I guess all I am seeing is a want for Free Form gaming, with Descriptors (maybe) in place of stats of anykind and a nearly GM less setting. I can see it working on a 1-1 real easy, perhaps PBEM/PBP/PBF just fine if you get a few people who are the heavy into long posts, then this should work like gunbusters. <br/>
Or maybe it is crystal clear to everyone but me because I am too old school gamer and dont see the need for all the "to me" gimmicks of much of the SG stuff. Or maybe I just game with people who game like me and we all have had a good time of it. <br/>

                            Tadk.<br/><br/>There is no right or wrong way, just different ways to do it depending on what you want.<br/> And that's what Sanctum: The Fallout is going to make a point of.<br/><br/>For people who just want a theme, that's what Sanctum is going to be...A Theme.

And never roll a single die or restrict a single thing about characters, they are playing Sanctum, as long as they follow the formula of my theme.<br/><br/>I could make up my own world based on DnD, but we'll all know where it came from.     Does everyone NEED me to tell them all the different ways to play my theme?  No...but I'm going to do it, because I'm sure someone will find it useful.<br/><br/>As for system designers, they can use my setting to help players understand their design just as I can use various systems to help demonstrate the different ways Sanctum could be played.<br/><br/>Make sense for you?

Well, we'll see if this theory is correct, since I AM aiming for this in the beta test, although Sanctum doesn't demand you play it this way... and my beta test is 20-50 people, not 1-1.    Time tells, right?<br/><br/>Another thing to consider is that something I've done with Sanctum is remove the filler.<br/><br/>I start with the bare bones and slowly add things that don't HAVE to be there, but add something to it if there.<br/><br/>What I don't do, is insist the filler has to be there from the very start, making it harder to do anything with.                        </div>

                            Ah, but here's the bit I bump up against with that.  If you were merely creating a setting, this would all be straightforward enough, but if I am understanding correctly, you are creating a sort of setting _structure_ (in the form of the thematic cities) in which virtually any sort of play is possible.  Want supers? City of supers.  What Ninjas? City of ninjas.<br/><br/>And this is slick as hell. It seems rather like the setting-equivalent of a generic game system, and that's a _fascinating_ direction of thought.  However, if i start from this premise, I need to figure out three things:<br/><br/>1) What system I want to use.<br/>2) What theme (or themes) to use<br/>3) What's going to _happen_ to transform this situation from static (My city has superheros) to dynamic (And Doctor Atomic is about to destroy it and only _YOU_ can stop it!).<br/><br/>Now, your answer to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> seems to be "Whatever system the person is comfortable with" and that's very friendly and cool to a point, though it's borrowing trouble.  If I only know Rifts, but I'm inspired by your game to make a city of intrigue populated by politicians and schemers, I'm going to suffer from the fact that Rifts is a decidedly bad system for that sort of game.  I need help. Is Sanctum going to provide it?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is not too much of a worry.  You've framed it clearly, and there's room for some interesting approaches to this, from fiat to consensus to random generation that are all equally workable, so no worries there.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is the where the real heavy lifting happens.  Suppose you and I are both running Sanctum, and I'm doing a game about the City of Ninjas and you're doing a game about the City Of Blaxploitation Films.  We have different skills and priorities as GMs, to say nothing of different subject material, so it's obvious how our games will be different, but how will they be _the same_? Aside from some vague similarities in premise, what is making it the same game for both of us?<br/><br/>To drill this into the concrete, allow me to contrast this with the Amber setting.  It's a multi-universal setting based on a series of novels, and one of its hooks is that anything is possible within its reality.  In practice, the range of Amber games is really fantastically diverse, but there are a few core ideas (some powers and some key characters) which remain central from game to game.  Even the games that do not include those elements are at least partly defined by their absence.<br/><br/>This is not to say you should be seeking to emulate the Amber DRPG, but it's very close to many of the ideas you're speaking of in Sanctum, and it provides one illustration of how to answer the question "If anything is possible, how is that different from no game at all (also known as "just making stuff up")?   I imagine Sanctum has a different answer, but I can't see it yet.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Sara,<br/>
I read your words, we talked in Gabby the other day, and I just dont get what the difference is. Could just be me making too much of how you say the theme and it keeps sounding like free form chat roleplay to me with just everyone deciding together if someone succeeds or not, taking the random facotrs out of the idea and making it 100% cooperative. Perhaps that is my hangup as I like some random factors involved in my gaming. While the sure things should be sure (drive a car, ride a horse, walk up a flight of stairs, read a book in a lang I know, etc) I do like that random element.<br/>
I think I need to stop reading this thread because I just dont get it at all. Sounds like you want to do with Sanctum: The Fallout what I already do and have been doing with my gaming for over 20 years, just sit down and play a game telling stories and making our different worlds come more alive with our interactions and actions than not. Thanks for trying to help me understand. Later Days and Stranger Ways, Tad                        </div>

                            tadk, I'm not sure you're understanding either.<br/><br/>I'm saying that the structure you are suggestiong that you want in a game comes from the game system you use my setting with.

                            As far as I can tell, Sanctum is intended to be a situation book, giving a context and options to expand the situation. It seems like a distant cousin of published adventures, albeit without mechanics or characters other than what is provided by the immutable laws of the situation. More apt, perhaps, it acts as the foundation for a variety of related situations to be played.<br/><br/>What makes this interesting, is that many "indie" RPGs aspire to do something very similar, except embrassing mechanics and overt system, rather than eschewing them. That being said, Sanctum should only work for systems which overlap the situation in some way. <br/><br/>For example, Eldritch Ass Kicking is not a system which can adapt to Sanctum without major thematic changes, simply because the situation in Sanctum doesn't mesh with playing powerful, insane archmages. <br/><br/>On the other side, I worry that Savagery may be a poor choice, because it demands a level of normality beneath what Sanctum seems to allow. The crux of that game is being in a rut and choosing to change your own life (for the better or the worse), but if your life has already changed, then the goal is already met. It seems combining the two will leave one or the other as only a backdrop. Send me a whisper if you'd like to discuss this in more detail and show me how you see Savagery fitting with Sanctum.<br/><br/>That being said, I expect there is a market for this. A solid, supportive, and creative book describing different ways to build on an already interesting situation could be extremely valuable. And you'll likely get better results if you are careful about what can and cannot be combined with Sanctum as is. A certain amount of generic-ness in the system or a strong overlap in situation is almost certainly required. <br/><br/>    - Mendel S.                        </div>

I'd like to think so.  All you have to do is introduce who those politicians and schemers are, give them the traits or quirks that you want from them, and go from there.  I'd suggest that you start further along in Sanctum's history, so instead of the day of, it's more like a few years down the line...or maybe this city is the new one, and the city that is 'discovered', or perhaps discovers you is the one with all the polititians and schemers...   All you're doing is taking one premise and replacing it with Sanctum's, which will throw some interesting kinks into the mix but as I look at it, only add to the fray.

That's the neat part in my eyes, so I'm going to explain it in an odd way. Let's say You're both running Sanctum, and lets say you are using a different system than each other...find a system that works well with what both games want to do and then simply throw them into the same fray.  <br/><br/>What you have now, is two entirely different cities with entirely different themes...and one hell of a culture shock.  Why can't they co-exist?   Sanctum says they can...<br/><br/>In fact, you could even throw a new twist in there, perhaps technology doesn't work in one city, where in another city, you can actually use magic.   Lets say that the 'rules' of the city, define the city and one way of keeping them solidified is that within THAT city...everyone has to follow those same rules.   (How's that for starting to explain why everyone just doesn't move to whatever city they want?)                        </div>

                            Sara,<br/>
Ok I just skimmed the brochure<br/>
Basically 3 classes, Skeptics, Realists, Questioners. I get my Ends together, Create my Means, (I also skimmed the what is Ends and Means off the LARP Site) so when I print off that intro page on the LARP site, the Brochure, I am all ready to play in Sanctum: The Fallout. You already provide all the materials (exluding what my first Theme/City which I would let you decide) with those 3 pieces of paper and a scratch piece of paper since I write large anyways and a pencil I guess I would be ready to either play or run Sanctum. <br/>
So with that said, you could post that as a 2 page RPG over at www.1km1kt.com because it is pretty much complete I would say) and let them comment also on it. <br/>
But I still dont see why i need any other system, you already have it all there.<br/>
I also dont see why I need the Sanctum/Endsand Means system either, as I can just (based on the chosen theme) just use any system that fits into that theme. We have an epic fantasy theme going on with skyscrapers turned into trees, roads are now rivers and cops are talking porcine (editorial comment there) moving in packs terrorizing the Protagonists, I could use GURPS, or d20 or Fuzion or Fudge, or The Window, or Shadowrun and not need anything else besides a few mins to make up some cheat sheets and notes for this old man....<br/>
So yes reading the brochure explained your initial system, now I totally dont know why you think it needs to adapt to any other system besides the one you have imbedded into it. The system helps to define the setting, and the setting helps to define the system, somethign I firmly believe in. You can make things fit, but for the most part we have all made systems to fit the setting envisioned. <br/>
What is really different about this Sara or should I just chose a theme and go from there. I do like the base idea a lot, being a cross-genre gaming sort of person. Tad<br/>
<br/>
EDIT Part: Ok read your post to the above comment, and if I am running my Theme of Steampunked Sidhe in a Dark City Alien Planet using Fuzion and you are running a Delaney inspired post apocalypic Theme of a crumbling cityscape overrun with giant vines and fungus using Ends and Means, other than my just mentally deciding what your results are when your characters interact with mine, how does it really work. I guess I am getting too nuts and bolts here and not seeing the big picture for the words being used.                        </div>

                            Sara,<br/><br/>Here's what I think would be cool and would be an answer to Rob's question.  If in your book you have the first chapter explain your premise for the game. Then for the rest of the book each chapter is a new city completely developed and ready to play, to include recommended systems to use.  For example...<br/><br/>Chapter 1 - What this Product is about.<br/>Chapter 2 - City of Superheroes.<br/>Chapter 3 - City of weird supernatural things that want to eat your face<br/>Chapter 4 - City of situation comedic relationships<br/>Chapter 5 - City of gang warfare<br/>Chapter 6 - Cith of killing things and taking their stuff<br/><br/>Etc etc<br/><br/>Then the last chapter might be to explain a method for how you developed each City/scenario so that the player reading your book has some clue on how to do this themselves and reliably get and good experience.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite><br/>For example, Eldritch Ass Kicking is not a system which can adapt to Sanctum without major thematic changes, simply because the situation in Sanctum doesn't mesh with playing powerful, insane archmages.</blockquote>
Why not?   This sounds like a dare!  *grins*   I bet you I could do it!       -keep in mind that ONLY the core things of Sanctum have to be followed...nothing says that the theme can't be a bunch of powerful, insane archmages being plucked off their world and thrown into a city with something that makes them go WTF...You don't have to adjust the system, Sanctum adjusts FOR the system, while keeping its foundation in place-
<blockquote>On the other side, I worry that Savagery may be a poor choice, because it demands a level of normality beneath what Sanctum seems to allow. The crux of that game is being in a rut and choosing to change your own life (for the better or the worse), but if your life has already changed, then the goal is already met. It seems combining the two will leave one or the other as only a backdrop. Send me a whisper if you'd like to discuss this in more detail and show me how you see Savagery fitting with Sanctum.</blockquote>  Sure, I'll do that...but keep in mind that in my eyes, all you have to do with savagery is suggest is that "sanctum" IS the rut...perhaps people are compeletely lost in this new world...or depressed because before, they had everything.   Maybe they are angry because no one takes them seriously, or they can't see a new life in this 'new life" <br/><br/>Expect those whispers <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

The good news is, i think we're getting close to the heart, so let me concentrate on this one first.<br/><br/>I'm making a posit here: If I want to play a game that is like, say, the West Wing, Rifts is a terrible, terrible, terrible game choice of a game.  This does not mean that Rifts is a bad game, but the things it does well are not the things that I want to have happen in my West Wing game (not to say that it couldn't be a fun mashup). For my "City of Senators" game,  I'm armed only with a ruleset that lets me do glitterboys and juicers and I am, mechanically, heading for a complete trainwreck.<br/><br/>So how does Sanctum save my bacon?<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

I dont think Sanctum saves your bacon if you are going to do a West Wing using Rifts. Unless you toss out the existing OCCs and just use the few that fit in, the gutter rat like one (forget the name sitting at work) and a few others and just ignore MDC weapons, and such, then it would work. Unless you were mashingup West Wing and rifts (welcome to Chi Town for real) then it would work.<br/>
I think what I was missing before is the saying any system can work in the Sanctum setting, and then the talk about Ends and Means, etc. <br/>
Because I think like how I feel, the system must match up to the setting/genre/THEME being gamed in. <br/>
The rest is fun and games and playing with your characters in the chosen Theme                        </div>

I'll keep focusing on Rifts for the City of Senators because it's very specific and it's such a fantastically terrible mismatch.<br/><br/>As I see it, if I actually know dozens of systems, I'll buy that Sanctum will have some useful advice like "Ok, so you expect a game that's going to be mostly about X? Well, then you want a game that does Y and Z but you need to be careful of A and B" and that's totally cool.  My concern is that if I only know Rifts, that advice isn't going to help me.  All I have is a hammer, and sooner or later everythign is going to look like a nail.<br/><br/>I know this may seem like a pretty odd example, but here's why it seems to matter to me.  If I already know a bunch of systems, odds are I'm already a pretty experienced gamer.  That's well and good, and I can still enjoy Sanctum, but I get the sense that one of your design goals is to make it more friendly to the novice, and the novice probably only knows one, maybe two systems.<br/><br/>Now, the obvious solution is for Sanctum to have some sort of lightweight, default mechanic of its own, designed for flexibility and with the caveat that it can be replaced with the system of your choice, but it sounds like this is _not_ what you're doing (though perhaps I misunderstand) so I'm trying to find out if you have somethign else in mind for our player who only knows one system, and it's a bad system for the game he's inspired to play.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Hrm...I think I understand the question a bit better.<br/><br/>My guess is that Kevin just isn't going to understand Sanctum until he gets to the section where it tells him that if he wanted to, he could turn everything into a nail.  (with stats), and hit everything with the hammer.    If this is how he gets a kick out of Sanctum, then all the power to him, because this will most likely be enough until he's ready for the other tools, which he might turn into hammers, but at least he'll have alot of nails <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/>  (And, when he is ready for the other tools, they will be there for him!)<br/><br/>(basically, the part where I realize that there are some people who want things pre-defined, so I just tell them in a more fluid manner how to, "just add stats" and roll for it, giving them a way to 'rift-a-fy' it -  therefore giving them a part of the 'game' that gamers who hate that sort of thing will just ignore, just as the Kevin is going to ignore everything but the "Hammer")                        </div>

                            Ok, thing is, are you happy with that? <br/><br/>Kevin might have a lot of potential, and just be limited by the fact that he's only been exposed to Rifts up to this point.  He's pretty much screwed in this scenario.<br/><br/>And that's not necessarily bad.  Not every game needs to be for every person, but if the game is really going to be about opening up new vistas for novices, I would argue that kevin is exactly the guy who needs Sanctum.<br/><br/>So, given that, and given that there are plenty of very lightweight rules systems that can be expressed in 10 pages or less, why _wouldn't_ you include some sort of default system? Would it hurt your game in some fashion?<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

Dang i keep coming back to this thread.<br/>
Would you mind if I concreted it more for me, and essentially started up a discussion of my own Theme (not a consensual one) and see if I can Sanctum out or not.                        </div>

                            Rob- <br/>Nope, in fact, I would absolutely LOVE to include 1-5 systems in my book, in the back with the modifications already made.<br/><br/>Adam Cerling has talked about including the "Sanctum: The Fallout" world-setting in his Book "Ends and Means", and I'm positively thrilled  by the notion.<br/><br/>I would love to do the same thing in reverse, to 1-5 systems in my book.   Explaining just the basics of the system, enough to play with...so that within this book, you have 5 completely different ways to play Sanctum: The Fallout.<br/><br/>But, I don't want generics...(hint, hint to all you system developers!)<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>tadk: You keep coming back because Sanctum is addictive...and the possiblities are endless...and I have you madly addicted!  *evil maniacal laughter inserted here!*<br/><br/>Ahem...I mean... If you mean that you want to try and see if you can create a system/game that works with Sanctum: The Fallout,  so you can understand it better, then I am open to letting you try.  Just as long as you acknowledge that you are using Sanctum and be clear on what you are doing with it, and be open to suggestions and critique, including mine.                        </div>

                            Ah ha. I misunderstood that, and interpreted that as you _referencing_ 1-5 systems, rather than including them, an as such, excellent. Kevin is saved!<br/><br/>Though your disinterest in generics raises a purely personal question of: why not? Sanctum seems liek it would go hand in hand with such games.<br/><br/>Anyway, wrapping up for the day, but this has been a very interesting discussion.

                            Well, because a lot of those _are_ generics of one sort or another.  Small games like Risus, Fate, CORPS, Mortal Coil and a ton of others are all pretty generic, pretty cool, and coming out of good places.  Even beyond that, there are great engines like Over the Edge which, even if not directly available, provide fantastic inspiration.  I'm not sure why you'd dismiss those, especially since they are generally better suited to handle a diverse array of themes.<br/><br/>U'less you're meaning Generic slightly differently than the GURPS sense of the word?<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            That sounds like it will be an excellent approach.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - As an aside, given your stated goals and interests, let me just toss up a flare that I suspect you would find Brennan Taylor's<a href="http://www.galileogames.com/mortal-coil/index.html" rel="nofollow">Mortal Coil</a> to be of great  interest.  It is a settingless system designed to create the setting in play, with a number of very clever mechanics to make it happen. While theroetically it's focused on fantasy games of a variety of stripes, the engine is actually _much_ more powerful than it is presented to be.  Additionally, Brennan's a very cool guy, and hangs around here, making it very easy to toss questions his way.                        </div>

The main source of awesomeness I can identify in your brochure is the factions (the Skeptics, Realists, and Questioners). That's where you've gotten the most specific, that's where the juice is. Get them into your pitch. Into the single-sentence pitch, if possible.                        </div>

                            Hey there,<br/>
I really want to make this work for me. The base setting idea really does appeal to me. Would you mind if I micro-playtested on my own, perhaps forum style if anyone in here wants to join me, and see how the flavor comes out from what is posted so far. <br/>
Thanks either way<br/>

You wouldn't be entirely wrong, but you wouldn't be entirely right.<br/><br/>The reason being that it is still a sort of framework that can overlap with almost anything already existant.  Just to blow Rob's mind, I'm going to do a quickly modified version of the rifts world...I always liked the Rifts world idea...I just never liked the system/game or some of the things about it. (one of many I'm sure)<br/><br/> Simply turn each theme/city into a sort of technology or magic.  The rifts remain but now are the only real way to the other cities.   Anytime you try to travel to another city without using a rift, you could very well end up in 'nightmare' dimension.  (think of the vampire sorts, and other nightmarish creatures)    In other words, take almost all of the scary things and stick them into places that exist only outside of the city...what if the cities were protected by the same magic that made the rifts?    Make the cities turn each technology into the one that people are in the city.   Now, instead of your gun working like a gun, it works like a magic wand, only instead of waving it, you pull the trigger.   And while the system says that you have to start on the same day for that first day, who's to say that everyone remembers that they didn't always live life this way?   In fact, what if only a few people remember?    What if some people seem to remember but dismiss it as a dream?  Maybe the reason for the sudden change in the world is a magic spell gone bad...an evil plot by an overlord, or a corrupt cyber-corp intent on re-arranging the structure of the universe so they can have a monopoly on everything...or maybe it backfired and hit them too.   <br/><br/>...getting the drift?<br/><br/>This is why I want to get permission to use different pre-existing systems/games in my book, so I can demonstrate.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>misuba, thanks!    I'll see what I can do.<br/><br/><br/><br/>and tadk, eat your heart out...I'm all for people trying it out for testing reasons.   Just keep me updated on what happens, okay?                        </div>

                            Sara,<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Ok, posting to all the readers of this thread<br/>
Anyone care to assist in a micro-playtest help Tad understand her concepts better<br/>
Either here in another thread or via email or off on another forum somewhere. Details will be ironed out.<br/>
Once someone says something, hopefully :), more concrete details will be ironed out.<br/>
