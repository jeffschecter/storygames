For those not familiar with Scion, it's a newer White Wolf game where the players are children of Gods and Goddesses from myth and legend.  Great game, if run right(which I maintain is how Thul runs it).  Kinda awkward and frustrating when run wrong(like how I ran it)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cast:<br/>\n<br/>\nGM<br/>\nStephen Miller, a Scion of Hephaestus (my character)<br/>\nRaymond Miller, a Scion of Ares (Yes, we're half-brothers, it's awesome)<br/>\nKonner("Europe"), a Scion of Tyr<br/>\n<br/>\nSynopsis:<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were finishing up an errand we'd been sent on long ago, I'm not going to go into all the backstory(Unless people really want, then I will as a comment).  Had a quick visit to the Miller home, and a conversation with step-dad Billy Mays.  Over the top humor.  Went on to visit Dionysus to drop off what he required (dwarves and a bunch of crack).  He gave us some schweet relics that helped our characters where they were weak, rather than where they were strong.  He sent us on to Vegas to investigate some rumors he'd been hearing.  We did, and tracked down Aphrodite.  She was willing to help us, but only if we did her a favor.  She's not in favor of reality dating shows, since they are so fake.  She wanted us to shut down the newest season of the Bachelor.  We went, found some dirt on the bachelor through some gumshoeing by Konner, some good hacking by Stephen, and some plain old dumb luck by Raymond.  We set up a huge, over the top, on air revelation of the Bachelor's secret right as all the contestants walked up.  We slipped away in the ensuing chaos.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat worked:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gifts from Dionysus.  Great to have my character, who is hideous, have a rose relic which will give him real roses all day.  Maybe he can find a woman!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole environment and style works great for me.  It's very Greek myth, which makes sense because we have two Greeks!  It's all over the top, and full of finding and fighting monsters, and running favors for gods that leave us feeling like we accomplished something.  Yes, we are pawns, but someday we'll be Gods too!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NPCS.  We'd been carting a pair of dwarves up from Rio, and I was actually sad to see them go.  They were kinda two track dwarves (sex and gold), but that's one more track than most dwarves have in Scion!  They were a lot of fun to interact with, and we all did often.  Hopefully we'll find/acquire some more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat could have been better:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ending of the first story felt moderately rushed.  We'd hit fun-to-overcome obstacle after obstacle on our way to LA, and the road from LA to Sonoma was absolutely clear.  While I'm cool with easy street for a bit, I think one more neat encounter would have been a lot of fun. Not that Aphrodite and the bachelor WEREN'T fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd have liked a little more time to dig for the dirt.  Not that it was bad the way it happened, what with this being basically a side-quest, but it felt kind of handed to us.  Which is alright.  At the same time, Stephen did a lot of prep work (fake id, painted the car to look official, etc) and did really well at the prep work, so maybe that was it's payoff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywho, lot's of fun!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
