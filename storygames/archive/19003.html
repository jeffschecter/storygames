After all, more eyes in a project is always great! After internal playtesting I've put the beta game up on DTRPG as pay-what-you-want, so go have a look if you're interested.<br/><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/121535/Legacy" rel="nofollow">Legacy</a> is a game about making history, about being presented with a world torn apart by cataclysm and building something from the pieces that will stand the test of time. For ages I've wanted to play a game drawing on the feel of Civilisation, building up a nation over many ages of history, but I wanted a more in-depth approach than you get in Microscope, as wonderful as it is. The way I've tried to do this in Legacy is by giving every player two playbooks - one for their family, and one for their character. Families and characters use different stats and have different basic moves, but the idea is that the two synergise together; the family needs the character to go out into the world and bring them the things they require, and the character can pull on the family's influence to accomplish large-scale objectives. As ages turn, new threats arise and new characters are created to deal with them.<br/><br/>Legacy draws on the feel of STALKER, Fallout and Numenera. The old civilisation, a glittering, mythic paradise full of wonders of magic and technology, was annihilated in a catastrophe that has left the world twisted and strange. Your families, survivors bound together by blood or ideology or desperation, are survivors emerging into the new world and trying to rebuild. Each family playbook is a different response to the Fall; some try to hold onto its remaining wonders, some find refuge in fanatical faith, some try to rebuild justice and law, and some are tyrants trying to craft a new empire. Your family stats are <b>Reach</b>, representing your social leverage, ability to get access to people, places and things, and information gathering capabilities, and <b>Grasp</b>, representing your family's ability to resist adversity and to claim things as their own. Families also have a pool of <b>Tech</b>, scavenged wonders of the world before that can be spent to aid their other activities, and <b>Surpluses and Needs</b>, things like <i>Morale, Recruits</i> or <i>Barter Goods</i> that give situational bonuses and penalties. Finally, Families have <b>Treaties</b> with each other that can be expended to call in favours (like Monsterheart's strings) or used to aid a family, and can be freely given to other families as bargaining chips. Families may pick new moves and stat increases as the age turns, although other benefits may be more tempting.<br/><br/>Characters are likewise marked by the fall of the old world and the strangeness of the new. Your character could be an <b>Elder</b> of the family, a respected statesman who's seen the family through many crises before; a <b>Hunter</b>, an exterminator specialised in hunting down the horrors of the fall who may occasionally hunt humans too; a <b>Remnant</b> of the Fall, someone or something imbued with the Fall's chaos and now adopted into a family; a <b>Survivor</b> who's outlasted endless trials and now makes their way through the world powered by grit; or one of the other playbooks.<br/><br/>Characters have four stats: <b>Force</b>, the ability to violently force change on the world; <b>Sway</b>, the ability to forge lasting connections with others; <b>Steel</b>, the ability to keep your wits and push aside pain and fear; and <b>Lore</b>, the ability to understand the wonders of the world before and utilise them. When characters get in danger, they may suffer harm, and every character has 5 Harm boxes that come with their own fictional and mechanical issues. For example, here's the Hunter's:\n<ul>\n<li>On the Defensive</li>\n<li>Out of Ammo</li>\n<li>Blood-Soaked</li>\n<li>Enraged (-1 Steel)</li>\n<li>Dead</li>\n</ul>\nLess hardy characters have more stat-penalising boxes, but the fictional consequences for even the penalty-free boxes are very real. When you mark off the Dead box, each playbook has a Death move that triggers, accomplishing something lasting. Then you choose one of your possessions as a relic, meaning that any family member that holds it gains access to one of your moves.<br/><br/>That's probably enough talking from me for now. I'd love to answer any questions or suggestions you guys have, and please do check out the game for yourself.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424482/#Comment_424482" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T08:33:28+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  8:33AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

I'd love to see how that works, and their stats.<br/><br/>Are you familiar with Jason Pitre's <i>Spark</i>? One of the things I love about it is how it gradually evolves the ideals and circumstances of a setting through players' actions.

What a harm box means is kinda decided by the player and the GM at the time it's checked, if that makes sense? So if a Hunter's Out of Ammo has been checked when they already have no equipment in the fiction, it might mean they're exhausted or lacking in ingenuity. As for how temporary it is, you have two choices for recovering harm - either use up one of your family's surplus in a place of safety to heal all harm (for <i>Out of Ammo</i>, possibly representing buying more ammunition or breaking open old stores) or try to shake off an injury in the midst of things, with that being more risky the more wounds you have and potentially resulting in the loss of wound slots, increased penalties on wound slots or other consequences (here representing frantically searching for some weapons to use, maybe). As characters are expected to be played for only 2 to 4 sessions, I'm happy with injury having real consequences.<br/><br/><br/>For <i>Spark</i>, I got in on the Kickstarter after hearing the Walking Eye's playtest but haven't had time to read it yet. I recall it had a lot of meta elements - mechanics for scene framing, conflict resolution, etc - which are things I'm trying to shy away from here, but I really should sit down and give it a read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424493/#Comment_424493" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T11:21:09+00:00" title="November 20, 2013 11:21AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds good!<br/><br/>That's one component to <i>Spark</i>; the other component is that the setting is defined by the Agendas of various groups. In between sessions, players get to choose which Agendas don't go forward...but you can't stop them all from advancing. After the session, Agendas advance, so the various factions of the setting wind up doing new things. So, step by step, the setting evolves and advances, and the players either fight it or embrace it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wurzel" title="Wurzel"><img alt="Wurzel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/271/n3AUOJYMMHV3A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wurzel">Wurzel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424606/#Comment_424606" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T07:11:28+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  7:11AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2013 7:12AM by Wurzel.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having read through The Spark, I reckon I could borrow from it by having players set out their Family's agenda for the current age when the game starts and The Age Turns move is used. This isn't doing anything more than making something explicit that is at the moment implicit, arising from a family's Needs, Surpluses, Doctrine and Moves, but players explicitly stating what their family wants can only be a good thing.

But what does this suggest about the communities? Most of the bonds are fairly positive/supportive (or at worst: "here's this person's flaw") so this could imply that the families are pretty copacetic, or at least not at war.<br/><br/>With this kind of game, you could end up with a lot of setting burden for the GM, as well as major spotlight issues. Is the goal to throw external threats? To use family vs family conflict? It's worth noting that a lot of the family moves let players rescue themselves from problems, rather than relying on other families: should you encourage that?<br/><br/>I don't know/think that these questions are worth answering definitively: there's a lot of variation for interesting play. But right now, the moves/agendas/principles don't really address this other than through implication, and there's no mechanism (see also: Homeroom in Monsterhearts) for having setting-building or having a conversation about what kind of game to have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wurzel" title="Wurzel"><img alt="Wurzel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/271/n3AUOJYMMHV3A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wurzel">Wurzel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425750/#Comment_425750" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-13T06:48:10+00:00" title="December 13, 2013  6:48AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback! Work's been pretty busy so I haven't had much time to check here, but your perspective is very useful.<br/><br/>One thing I'm learning with actually publishing a game is that you have to really analyse all facets of how you run the game and make sure all the crucial bits are explicit. This is one of those points; when I've run the game so far I've spent much of the first session establishing the homeland of the player families - what the terrain and climate is like, how many settlements there are, what relationships the different families have with each other, and what threats might be on the approach. Obviously this is something I need to write down in the new game section! Basic assumption is that the player families have been in the local area for at least a generation or so, and families are spread out between 5 or 6 settlements (clustered variously depending on whether families are nomadic, dispersed or settled).<br/><br/>For the concerns about family interaction, it's certainly something I'm worried about too. The key thing that each family is wanting to do in a given age is to resolve their needs, to gather more surpluses and to resolve their agenda, and while the GM can work to give reasons to co-operate [1] or work against each other [2] it's something that ought to be addressed in the game itself. It seems to be working out ok in play so far, but that could be just the natural instincts of the players to work with each other.<br/><br/>[1] Family A needs food and Family B needs medicine; scouts bring word of a storehouse from the Before containing all kinds of things for people willing to brave the defences<br/><br/>[2] Family A comes into a cache of weaponry but loses plenty of recruits doing so, giving the militaristic Family B an opportunity to take them                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wurzel" title="Wurzel"><img alt="Wurzel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/271/n3AUOJYMMHV3A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wurzel">Wurzel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439951/#Comment_439951" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T14:51:01+00:00" title="November  5, 2014  2:51PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After almost a year of playtestings, the game is now up on Kickstarter!
