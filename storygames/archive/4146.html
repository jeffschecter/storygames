You played cats.  It was heavily influenced by <i>Bunnies and Burrows</i> and <i>The Morrow Project</i>, an unholy combination if ever there was one.  I remember that your cat had blood points, and could easily bleed to death from an untended wound.  Who tended the wounds?  That I do not recall, but combat was stuffed with martial arts combo tables taken directly from <i>B&amp;B</i>. You were not special cats and did not have thumbs.  I don't remember what, if anything, you actually <i>did.   </i><br/><br/>You probably wrote your own RPG at some long-ago point - something excellent and goofy.  Spill it!

It involved rolling 1d6 against various stats and was entirely one-on-one imaginary combat.  I remember each character had a trademark "set" and you would choose which character's set you would fight in before dueling.  Sets had various objects and scenery in them that you could use for bonuses, throwing people into pillars or setting the room on fire.  Characters gained XP for winning fights, which was instantly convertible into new abilities.  However, the rules involved enough randomness that your character could lose 3 straight and still triumph over someone who'd won 3 straight (and had the XP from doing so).<br/><br/>We ran it at lunch on the bleachers in the gym (which was where we ate during the winter).  I bet we played out at least a dozen or so fights before we got bored with it and started trading Magic cards (but never actually playing Magic) instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92956/#Comment_92956" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T11:42:55+00:00" title="September  4, 2007 11:42AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure how much of a RPG this is, but my friend and I used to play this game during our sleepovers in 6th/7th grade amongst the shag carpet and Wayne Gretzky posters.<br/><br/>We made a matrix of different girls at school that we liked (and I few we didn't, for color or humor I suppose).  Then we switched off rolling dice to see which girl on the matrix we were "going after".  One roll meant you went out with her.  A second roll meant you kissed her.  And a third roll meant that you were "going out" and the other player couldn't roll her anymore.  Kind of like closing off numbers in the Darts game "Cricket".<br/><br/>In retrospect, this game tells me a lot of things:<br/>1. We were completely terrified of girls and had to distill all of our social anxiety down to a game mechanic we could understand (and win).<br/>2. We were careful not to step on the other person's "territory" by dating someone else's girl.  This actually continued into our dating years as we never swapped girls back and forth.<br/>3. By eventually dividing up the entire girl population between the two of us, we certainly had illusions of romantic grandeur!<br/><br/>But 25+ years later, I will give it a name..."Players"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92960/#Comment_92960" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T11:47:29+00:00" title="September  4, 2007 11:47AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2007 11:47AM by Rafael.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote Synths in 1986 or 1987.

I think it would have had psionics if I had understood the D&amp;D psionics rules at the time.<br/><br/>The second was a pirate themed game rather imaginatively entitled Pirates, circa 1983 or 1984.  A friend and I were going to design this game, and I'd checked several books out of the public library to read about pirates.  I kinda got bogged down in coming up with ship construction rules.  I'd had experience with a few more games by this time, but it was still going to look like D&amp;D (I think the ship design rules were going to be very much like Car Wars).  <br/><br/>The third was going to be somewhat based on the Laser Tag sets (the toy with this actual name) as a way of playing out Laser Tag-like duels ('85 or '86).  You had several sets of paired stats -- in each pair there was an active stat and a resistant stat, for instance Shoot and Dodge, or Perceive and Hide.  When attempting to do something to another character you used the one against the other, and there were also ways you could mix and match them (I think).  It was either each side roll 1d6 and add the appropriate stat, or roll 1d6 + stat - opposing stat + some number, I can't recall.  There were also rules for fumbles and "going hand-to-hand" (whereby you and your opponent run up to each other, shove your gun at the other's sensor, and pull the trigger as many times as you could until one of you died).  By this time I'd played a lot of Champions and other Hero System games, and maybe GURPS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Game books, or otherwise. So I just decided to put together some rules and take it on the road.

It was about Ninjas in a Ninja Pagoda Dungeon.  You had like 2 stats. It was based 90% on the system behind the Lone Wolf book series. It was meant for one to four people, but you were playing against the "book".<br/><br/>In seventh grade or eighth grade (I get them confused; neither was much fun) I made two RPGs, one incomplete, the other complete.<br/><br/>Incomplete: I forget the name, but it was after I read the original Justifiers and was inspired by 80s era cartoons like Inhumanoids and the one with the Holographic Standards/Banners, and the box art to Gammarauders. It was a game where you played Dinosaurs who came to life again, but in the future. You fought bad dinosaurs for the sake of the human race. Of course, you did this via guns and melee weapons. I think that <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/mail-order-monsters" rel="nofollow">Mail Order Monsters</a> provided some inspiration as well.<br/><br/>Complete: a game called, no lie, <b>PLASTIC STORAGE CONTAINERS</b>. I was experimenting with comedy, including subtlety and irony, in those days and I think that's where I got the idea. As well as the "Storage Jars" skit from Monty Python (<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=65c6tfuvyxo" rel="nofollow">Begins at 3 minutes and 40 seconds</a>) and the movie Aliens. I made the title as a joke to my best friend, then I very seriously and earnestly set out to write the rules, using Paranoia 2E as the basic framework.<br/><br/>Basically, it is the Far Future. You are a soldier for this empire that has spawned across the galaxy, conquering just about everything. However, dangers still abound (namely in the form of ancient ruins with artifacts to steal and death traps to avoid). Your mission is to make use of your weapons, cyber gear, psionic powers, and other RIFTS-like abilities, and scout around the galaxy looking for artifacts of other civilizations... and then placing these priceless artifacts in, you guessed it, plastic storage containers.<br/><br/>The rules for the game were almost all in my head, but I used really fine graph paper to make this HUGE elaborate character sheet.  When you were a kid, did you ever draw elaborate fortresses on paper with your friends, and compare them to see which was the most secure? ("Nope, if you go there this laser turret zaps you! Nope, if you dig there, these worms come and eat you!") It was like the Character Sheet version of that.  The only things I remember about it were:<br/>1) It took me a long time to write, and<br/>2) It was very complicated, featuring dozens if not hundreds of boxes, and<br/>3) There was a box in the middle of the sheet called "POG SPOT", where you recorded the current size of your Pog Spot, a type of birthmark that all citizens of the Empire had. It could grow or shrink in size. It had, literally, NO GAME EFFECT WHATSOEVER. I thought that this was very clever.<br/><br/>I would actually pay $100 if I could find that character sheet again, seriously. That was one of the first things I ever really created, crafted from nothing (save Paranoia 2e).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93038/#Comment_93038" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T17:13:12+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  5:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2007 5:19PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first pen &amp; paper RPG I can remember designing (and I know I have board game designs and computer games well older than this, since I didn't get exposed to RPGs until my senior year of high school), you were this totally badass immortal.  I don't remember much of the fiddly bits now, but I recall you had an Immortal Rating, and essentially if you had a higher rating than someone else they were screwed.<br/><br/>Magic and planeshifting was probably a big deal.  I think that was in my "dude, planeshifting is hot" phase.<br/><br/>I don't remember the title of this game, but here was a big element of the design: a tank was Immortal Rating 0.  A hundred tanks: Immortal Rating 0.  A dude with a sword &amp; an Immortal Rating of 1 could totally kill a hundred tanks easy.<br/><br/>Since I don't remember the title, I'll now name it: "My Sword-Dude Could Totally Kick A Tank Army's Ass, Oh, And There's Probably Planeshifting"<br/><br/>Edit: Oh!  I totally remember the name now!  It was based on an outgrowth of a computer solo RPG I made before I got into pen &amp; paper RPGs: Conjoure.  (The original being a 8000+ line QuickBASIC game that I couldn't compile, thanks to QB only using conventional memory.)  There wasn't any planeshifting in that game, but oh man, the sequel was going to be all about planeshifting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy" title="T-Boy"><img alt="T-Boy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/T-Boy">T-Boy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93039/#Comment_93039" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-04T17:38:53+00:00" title="September  4, 2007  5:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2007 5:47PM by T-Boy.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The first Role-playing game I designed was<i>Kitties and Catnip,</i>in junior high school.

My friends and I had moved on from watching giant robots on TV and playing with robot toys to the totally kick-ass, mature realm of drawing badass giant robots. I then took the logical next step of making a way for us to have our robots fight each other. (We would have <i>killed</i> for Mechaton.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI formalized a stat system and probably cribbed the percentile system from <i>Gangbusters</i>, of all things. (TSR system for '20s pulp action converted to Force Field vs. Missiles. Hey, percentile systems are easy to tinker with.) The IIEE was borked, the rules changed during play, and the few times we actually did play it out we usually ended up arguing until we quit playing. (Although, now that I think about it, all our other games usually ended that way, too. Thirteen year old boys and conflicting agendas, hoo boy. If nobody was ever willing to lose, you'd think we'd fight NPCs instead of each other, but we didn't think of that. So mostly we used it to write up "stat cards" for the stuff we drew.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do remember that total home-brews were pretty much the only thing you could play at one guy's house, since his mom was a fundamentalist Christian who thought all popular media was bad (TMNT got banned because ninjas use 'black magic', for instance, and Marvel was right out for the Karma stat.) Half our sleepovers were there, so it was homebrew or <i>Dragonraid</i>, take your pick.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in its defense, this one time we were playing I had this sweet image of my little mech taking on this big mothership, and totally blowing up incoming missiles with the point defense guns on my shoulders. The first time I saw <i>Robotech</i>, I was totally like "I played that".<br/>\n<br/>\nI just realized that this is the only game I ever formalized enough to play without me running it (not that anyone did). I need to fix that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I just experienced immersion as myself in seventh grade. That's the only explanation I have for having typed "totally" that many times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93104/#Comment_93104" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T01:03:21+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  1:03AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before I started doing RPG designs, I started illustrating the back covers and full page colour ads (to appear in stuff like Dragon, White Dwarf and whatever) for games that I would eventually be in charge of designing. I am talking about massive operations here - whole office buildings put to work on games, with me in charge. Because my ideas were brilliant.<br><br>One of my computer game ads I drew up was for Bloody Demon Attack. You could kill people 8 different ways.

When I was 9 or 10 I used to love grabbing a new notebook and starting to write a new game in it - not any of the useful stuff like mechanics or setting, but all the boring crap stuff that rpgs have at the beginning (pithy and cocky introduction, what is roleplaying, what you will need etc) because clearly that was <i>how a game should look</i>. They all had crappy names that were acronyms of something (C.O.D.E. and so on) and all fantasy heartbreakers. The Fighting Fantasy books were my primary source of inspiration at that stage, although these were clearly intended to be in the mould of WFRP or DnD.<br/><br/>Then a few years later me and my brother spent one summer holiday making a surprisingly complete game that was part wargame/part rpg, with each player controlling a single big giant mech. It was like some unholy crossbreed of Battletech, Power Rangers and the old GW/40k game, Confrontation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93156/#Comment_93156" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T09:26:51+00:00" title="September  5, 2007  9:26AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>crossposted from collective endeavor, which crossposted this thread</i><br/>\n<br/>\nMy first game was something I designed at school.

Eventually I think it grew a few more, but that was the main thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt started as a little map I drew on graph paper in maths class, which someone else explored around, collecting treasure and trying not to die in traps. Because it was so fatal I changed it so that the whole game was one big virtual reality system. The characters (if you can call them that, they still had no stats or backgrounds) were rich members of a future society who spent their whole life competing in the game trying to see who could gain the most treasure and loose the least lives, just like the players did.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy a process I can't fully remember the game expanded until the main map was about 7 or 8 feet across (made out of many many sheets of graph paper stuck together) with piles of extra dungeon levels and maybe 10-12 people were playing on a semi-regular basis. I would take the map and my folder of other maps into the school library at lunchtimes and lay it out on the main table and people would come and tell me what they were doing next, roll some dice, take turns and so on till lunch was over.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot quite an RPG, but a game certainly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93191/#Comment_93191" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T10:59:11+00:00" title="September  5, 2007 10:59AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite>Heh.

Cool and kinda novel...my step down the dark path of design.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson" title="ShaneJackson"><img alt="ShaneJackson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ShaneJackson">ShaneJackson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93344/#Comment_93344" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T02:41:36+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  2:41AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My game was BacTerra and everybody played dudes armed with spears who flew around on the backs of giant dragonflies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the GM section there was a big secret that must be kept secret: the dragonflies were actually normal-sized and the spear dudes were very small.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIT WAS OUR EARTH!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93351/#Comment_93351" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T04:37:16+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  4:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ShaneJackson</cite>IT WAS OUR EARTH!!!</blockquote>\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
