I'd like to run a quick game/extended demo for them sometime, to perhaps entice them to more gaming later.  I've got two or three potential players, and the session will have to fit into an hour's lunch break.  Does anyone have anything to hand that would be suitable?<br/><br/>Ideally, I'd like something akin to Don't Rest Your Head.  It would fit nicely with the book/film/video game interests of the players, but I don't have much inspiration on how to make a compelling one-hour session for it, from a cold start.  If anyone has any bright ideas, please shout!<br/><br/>An alternative would be DitV with a slightly expanded version of the running example in the DitV book (your nephew's stealing from his dad to visit the whore in town).  Have the vengeful dad, the nephew who wants to marry his lover, the whore who wants independence and freedom from her pimp husband, and the pimp who's turned his back on the Faith.  If I lay the situation on the table at the start, could this be resolved in an hour with novice players?<br/><br/>Neil.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110563/#Comment_110563" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T04:54:58+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  4:54AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you know these people well?

You'll have the advantage of people who have a background that plugs into what you want to do. The rapid chargen was, for me, the most fun and I'd suggest chopping up the dialable parts of the game into pithy categories and using a visual aid to set their levels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110569/#Comment_110569" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T05:22:45+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  5:22AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Neil... just use Don't Rest Your Head and improvise <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I mean, the players frame their first scene on the character sheet. Have them play out that scene independently, then when the climax of the scene has been reaced, fade to black, cut, and present a scene where they both are in an interesting place of the Mad City (probably the Bizarre Bazaar), and have something happen.

Pulp plays in nicely because there are a bunch of natural cliffhanger points since we only have an hour.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, running <i>at work</i>, you're going to be limited by all of your company's harassment policy stuff. So be very careful about your subject matter. For that reason, Dogs in the Vineyard seems right out. I haven't read Don't Rest Your Head or Contenders, but from what I've heard, I'd be careful about those too.<br/><br/>But if the strong themes is what is drawing them, and you don't want to have to set up those boundries, you could always go someplace offsite or sell them on dinner at your place to run a demo (that way its more like hanging out instead of going there to game which they aren't sure they'll like).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112024/#Comment_112024" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-05T11:49:21+00:00" title="December  5, 2007 11:49AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite>...Contenders, but from what I've heard, I'd be careful about those too.</blockquote>\nWhat have you heard, may I ask? I found <i>Contenders</i> to be very neutral in tone, assuming that you're not dealing with folks for whom boxing or fencing or MMA or whatever is taboo (Ultra Pacifists?). Folks talk about "last night's fight" at work all the time (major Fortune 500 company--you can bet our policy manual is THICK). It seems to me that any "harassment" that might occur in <i>Contenders</i> would come from very poorly chosen relationships (or whatever <i>Contenders</i> calls those motivations): I fight to pay for my mistress's AIDS treatments; I fight to pay blackmail money to a guy who has pictures of me fucking a cow (cross-thread reference for 2 points!).<br/><br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
