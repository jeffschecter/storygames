We're a bunch of relatively traditional gamers, but the most common criticism I've been getting is that we just don't... care for combat, even though we usually feel "obligated" for it to be there.  So the potential of blasting through those bits of conflicts was one of the things that really sold the group on the idea.  By the end of the session, though, everyone's favorite bit was was the narrative control, which I was really happy to hear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe picked characters by everyone voting on what character other players would play, and we agreed Lady B wasn't a perfect fit for anyone, so I NPCed her and had her separated from the group, so they had to exact a rescue before leaving.  Eventually, Snargle (well, "Nav", the player wanted to play her as a fairy) got separated from the group, and that player asked to play Lady B once she was found.  Worked well enough.  With the rescue accomplished, the group ended up inciting a mutiny aboard the ship, using Vance's imperial background and data from the archives to confront the crew of the Hand of Sorrow with Hollas' darker history.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were nearly closing up when Vance reunited with the Lady and decided to make his big reveal -- he was, in fact, <b>the pirate king Uriah Flint in disguise</b>!  If the drinks weren't flowing, we might've questioned whether that made sense, but they were, so we didn't.  It seemed like a great dread pirate Roberts moment, and a good way to end the night.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone agreed that it was a blast, but that they didn't want to continue this game (though they were totally into giving it another try sometime with everyone swapping characters, or giving Jedi Blackbird a shot).  It was the first time everyone seemed happy to just end the story where we left it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was, honestly, completely refreshing.  I was getting in a bit of a slump GMing-wise.  I'd get excited about a game, and then have the actual running of the game be a bit of a stressful affair.  The fact that the game explicitly told me not to prep much of anything and just ask questions just put me in an entirely different mode.  It's definitely changed the way I'll be GMing in the future, and I think it changed the way my players will be playing.  I had tried to get them to take more narrative control in previous games, but for whatever reason, it didn't click until Lady Blackbird, and they loved it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373007/#Comment_373007" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-15T19:16:42+00:00" title="April 15, 2012  7:16PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2012 7:17PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So glad to hear the game went well. Especially that GMing was fun and easy. That was definitely a goal of mine when putting the game together.<br><br>Also, this...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tsed</cite>he was, in fact,<strong>the pirate king Uriah Flint in disguise</strong>!</blockquote>\n...is just about the most awesome thing ever. I literally laughed out loud in delight.

It was pretty obvious to my players, at least, that things could've played out way different, not to mention it'd just be neat to see how different players handle character selection.  As I mentioned, this time we matched characters by consensus at the table, with everyone but the player being discussed deciding which character the player was best a match for.  It worked out great, but things would've been a lot different with players out of the mode where they were most comfy, I suspect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
