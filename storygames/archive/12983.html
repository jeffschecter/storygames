I'm trying to include game mechanics, if only because it helps me remember what's going on.<br/><br/>In a world of Sunny Days, a dark cloud comes to sweep it all away.\n<ul><li>Paul Hubbird as Bert (Insert Cards Here)</li>\n<li>Joey as Mr. Hooper (*, Mental Disorder, You are Special)</li>\n<li>Arnold Cassell as Sam the Eagle (Macho, Injured, Compassion)]</li>\n<li>and later... Ken Ditto as Ralph (Officer, *,\\ *)]</li></ul>\n[Scene 1, Paul frames]<br/>Bert starts the scene outside of Oscar the Grouch's trashcan, Sam the Eagle shows up while Bert is trying to get Oscar to answer.  Oscar owes Bert money, and Bert is trying to collect.  Sam approaches this conversation cautiously, and gets easily flustered and confused, he even offers to pay Bert the money now and collect from Oscar later.  We notice Sam's right wing is in a sling.  Sam admits that he isn't feeling very well, because he was accosted by a dumpster by a blue furry blur.  He thinks it was Grover, and that Grover might be hurt.<br/><br/>Enter Mr. Hooper, who listens and agrees with Sam the Eagle.  Mr. Hooper, Bert, and Sam go to the dumpster looking for Grover, but don't find him.  Sam insists that they should go in after him, but Bert isn't willing to go dumpster diving.  Bert wins the argument, and they sweep the rest of the streets.\n<ul>\n<li>Conflict was over scanning the dumpster, or diving headlong in to look.  Bert wins, despite being teamed up on by the other two.</li>\n</ul>\n[Scene 2, Joey frames]<br/>We enter the Hispanic district of Sesame Street, which is close to where the dumpster was.  Sam the Eagle's words betray a xenophobic bias (defend our borders, perhaps?), and he approaches Zoey roughly, trying to talk Mr. Hooper in to holding Zoey while Sam roughs her up a bit.  Sam seems to be doing this out of some twisted belief that it will help find Grover and get him the help he needs, but it doesn't work out.  The other two allow Zoey to run off quickly while the injured Sam fumes over his feelings of helplessness.\n<ul>\n<li>Conflict was over Sam trying to convince Bert to hold Zoey down.  Bert wins.</li>\n</ul>\n[Scene 3, Arnold frames]<br/>The trio arrive in another alley in the district, chasing a blue blur.  Mr Hooper thinks that Maria could be helpful, but again, the hispanic district is eerily empty.  They look up just as a caped shadow darts across the sky.  Is is Super Grover?  Sam can't give chase in his current state.<br/><br/>"Yip.  Yip.  Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip brrrrains yip yip yip," is heard from a distance, and Sam perks up.  "Uh, you two hole them off for me please.  I have to go.  I owe them money and I... uh... goodbye."  Somehow the other two are stunned long enough to give Sam an alibi.  He rushes out of the scene.\n<ul>\n<li>Conflict was over Sam trying to flee the scene.  Sam wins.</li>\n</ul>\n[Scene, traveling]<br/>Mr. Hooper and Ernie are trying to reach to Mr. Hooper's shop, but along the way they run into Snuffalupagus.  Literally ramming his left flank.  He slowly lumbers a turn to face them, and the pair are shocked to see that his furr is missing on the right half of his head.  Bare foam is exposed, still stained with the blue lines that the puppeteers use to guide them while cutting, and his right eye, hollow inside, is cracked like an egg and the "shell" is barely hanging together.<br/><br/>Before Hooper can do anything, Big Bird shows up and shouts "No!  Don't hurt him!  He's my friend!"  Before Hooper can pull the trigger, Snuffy turns on Big Bird who is so shocked (terrified?) that he lays an egg, which Bert takes as they rapidly leave the scene.\n<ul>\n<li>Conflict between Bert and Mr. Hooper, Bert wanting to stop Hooper from gunning down Snuffy.  Tie - zombies interrupt.</li>\n</ul>\n[Scene , Mr. Hooper's shop]<br/>Mr. Hooper and Bert arrive at Hooper's shop.  Mr. Hooper is preparing for war, and grabs some weapons ans supplies.  "I've seen this before," he says, "in `nam."  "Nam? Om Nom Nom Nom!" comes the voice of Cookie Monster, apparently having a relapse.  He is on top of a pile of discarded Mrs. Smith wrappers, and has moved on to the Soft Batch cookies.  Mr. Hooper is wigged out by flashbacks, and can't stand the sight of Cookie and his appetite.  Bert and Hooper argue over what to do with him, but Hooper levels both barrels into The Cookie Monster and ends his appetite before it turns to brains.\n<ul>\n<li>Conflict was over Bert trying to stop Hooper (a developing theme, perhaps?) Hooper wins.</li>\n</ul>\n[Scene , Mr. Hooper's shop, slightly later]<br/>Sam the Eagle arrives at the shop, entering and looking around.  At first he only finds Cookie Monster, near death and mumbling to himself.  "C is for... carnage... ow"<br/>"Oh!  Cookie!  You are very hurt!  I'll find you some help.  Please stay right here."<br/>"Help!" comes a cry from the storeroom in the back.  Sam replies "Ah!  I'll find help in the back and be right back."<br/>"Someone's robbing Mr. Hooper!" comes a cry from outside.  Sam becomes flustered by this, as he sees no one else in the store, but he decides to go to the storeroom first.  Sam frees Bert by biting the ropes with his beak, and lastly undies the gag.<br/>"Hooper tied me up!  He's gone crazy!  He's having flashbacks!  PTSD!"<br/>"Oh, that's terrible!  Just terrible!  But you have to come help me, I think Grover attacked again, and I don't know much first aid and-"<br/>Hooper interrupts, bursting in and shouting his plans.  In the middle of them, Sam learns the truth.  It was not Grover that had attacked Cookie Monster.<br/>"Mr. Hooper.  You killed Cookie Monster?"  Mr. Hooper looks to Sam the Eagle while proudly holding the shotgun.  Sam the Eagle leans in, one wing slung to his body, one wing pressing flat and firmly on the table, eyebrows scowling, and through his permanent frown he says. "Mr. Hooper...  Give me the gun."<br/><br/>Wormie appears on Sam the Eagle's shoulder, hungrily diving for his neck.  Cookie monster's hand invades the backroom, and several anonymous hands swarm Sam's already injured state.  Mr. Hooper doesn't take chances, and blasts Sam the Eagle to pieces.<br/><br/>Sam does not get the gun.\n<ul>\n<li>Conflict was over Sam trying to get the gun from Hooper.  Sam loses, forcing him onto the Zombie's square.</li>\n</ul>\n[Scene ?, Theater]<br/>Mr. Hooper and Bert run away and find shelter, locating a mostly empty building they can fortify.  Mr. Hooper and Bert attempt to discuss the plans seriously, with Bert trying to convince Hooper that they need to locate Ernie.  Statler and Waldorf offer derogatory commentary the entire time, and eventually it gets to Mr. Hooper.  He pulls a knife and tries to force Bert to help him kill the old couple.  <br/>Bert refuses and runs off, but Hooper puts a round through Statler.  Waldorf's reaction is shocked, but pleased?<br/><br/>Rolph shows up, having been deputized and ready to help quell this strange menace.  He finds Mr. Hooper armed and dangerous, alone in the theater.  The two of them are weary of one another at best, and Rolph attempts to bite Mr. Hooper to wrestle him down and calm him.\n<ul>\n<li>Conflict was over Rolph trying to prevent Hooper from gunning down more muppets.  Bert flees the scene.  Hooper wins.</li>\n</ul>\n[Sacrifice scene, interstitial]<br/>Mr. Hooper and Bert jump in as ravenous muppets close in on Rolph, firing wading through and firing around him.  Rolph is barely kept from harm, but now they are all isolated in a makeshift fort.\n<ul>\n<li>Paul and Joey realize that it's about to be Arnold's scene.  Arnold is a zombie, and that he also has the red coin.  If they don't do something quick, the zombies will advance two spaces and take Ken out.</li>\n</ul>\n[Scene, Outside Hooper's shop]<br/>Ernie, Rolph, and Mr. Hooper are bunkered down outside the shop, having build a wall out of the sandbags that were on sale (aisle 3).  A host of infected muppets are coming at them.  The infected "Yip Yip" aliens are there, having increased in number to over a dozen.  The Count is also among the assailants, shouting "Brains!  Ah ah!" Two Headed Monster is there, each head on a different side of the protective wall.  One is moaning "Brrrrr" the other "ains!"<br/><br/>Bert is lobbing grenades, mourning how he has abandoned his principles for this horrible (but necessary) slaughter.  The aliens are swallowing them like candy, puffing up and then deflating as the grenades have a less than intended effect.<br/><br/>Even Zoey has reappeared, "Me gusta comer las cabezas!"<br/><br/>Then out of nowhere, Snuffy comes charging in, intent to kill them all.  Rolph, Ernie and Hooper team up to take him out [insert more here, I don't remember it all]  Rolph dives at Snuffy in slow motion, firing off many many rounds as that horrible large trunk whips down with immense force towards Rolph.  Ernie ends the scene by landing a grenade in Snuffy, and fur and foam fill the air with a confetti of regret.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292595/#Comment_292595" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T11:03:45+00:00" title="September  9, 2010 11:03AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2010 7:01PM by Harlequin.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Scene, ]<br/>Rolph takes the crew to see Dr. Bunsen, who has Beaker tied to an operating table, shocking him with electricity.  His high pitched voice seems to cry for mercy, but you can almost hear his hunger for brains.  His coloring is off, slightly gray.  In the background, the Swedish Chef is attempting to assist Bunsen, mixing up a possible counter-virus.  An explosion takes the Chef's eyebrows comedically.<br/>Bunsen tells the crew that he has developed a cure, he thinks.  Intense sunlight seems to drive the infection away, but as he shows them his treatment, focusing it on Beaker, we learn it has a cost.  While Beaker regains his original color, he also catches fire, burning and melting amidst screams of pain and anguish.<br/><br/>Mr. Hooper wants Bunsen to initiate the plan, and cleanse the street, but is talked down my Bert, who wants to save someone first...<br/><br/>[Scene, the Streets]<br/>Helicopters zip across the sky, with a predator drone not far behind.  Sesame Street is certainly lost to this plague of madness and death.  The three remainder (Rolph, Mr. Hooper, and Bert) have left their fort and are trying to exit before the air-strike.  Bert demands that they take a detour to save Ernie!  Outside their apartment building, Bert believes he hears Ernie, but Mr. Hooper and Lew Zealand tell him that "that building's lost, there's no way we're waiting for you."<br/><br/>The grenade meant to collapse the entry way and stop Bert from his foolish quest is caught mid-air by Bert's pigeon, and Bert runs inside.<br/><br/>Bert doesn't fine Ernie, and the building is collapsed in an explosion of rubble, and we see <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Doglion" rel="nofollow">Doglion</a> peeking back at the camera, apparently surprised to be included in this movie.<br/><br/>[Scene, the streets]<br/><br/>Ernie arrives shortly afterward "Where ya been, Bert?"  Too late do we realize that Ernie is a new super-zombie, with a stitched on scorpion like tail, he latches on to Bert as Hooper and Rolph lay in to him.  Bert holds Ernie so Hooper and Rolph have to shoot through him.\n<ul>\n<li>Bert tried to prevent Ernie's death, but lost.  His marker drops to the Zombie square.  The zombie, btw, had advanced all the way to the "new abilities" part of the board.</li>\n</ul>\n[Scene, Elmo's world]<br/>Mr. Hooper knows that if anyone is worth saving on Sesame Street, it's Elmo.  Elmo isn't having a good time of it.  His furniture has rebelled against him, having become infected.<br/>"What will Elmo do?  I know!  Elmo will ask a baby!"  The baby lunges at Elmo hungrily.  "Oh no baby!  Help!  Help Elmo!"  Mr. Hooper dives in to the room and shoulders against the furniture, creating an opening for Elmo when all seems lost.  Elmo escapes while Mr. Hooper fights and fights, eventually leaving himself.<br/>He looks at Elmo, but Elmo focuses on Mr. Hooper's shoulder.  Still smiling, Elmo shakes his head slowly "Shouldn'ta got bit, Mr. Hooper."  Mr. Hooper's eyes go wide as Elmo draws a 15 inch carving knife and plunges it repeatedly into Mr. Hooper.<br/><br/>[Scene, the street]<br/>Rolph the dog is running down the street, when Oscar gets his attention from near an alleyway.  "Hey, you know the only way out is through Grouchland."  Elmo erupts on to the scene, bloody knife still in hand.  Elmo and Rolph come closer to Oscar, who opens up a sewer lid and encourages them in.  "Elmo's going to LIVE, motherfuckers!" Elmo says as he grits the bloody knife in his mouth and descends.<br/><br/>Rolph and Elmo find themselves cornered below the street.  Oscar lured them into a trap!  Oscar has been plotting the downfall of Sesame Street all along!<br/><br/>All ends in fur and blades and death...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292797/#Comment_292797" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-10T07:32:51+00:00" title="September 10, 2010  7:32AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't decide if this is awesome, horrible, horribly awesome, or awesomely horrible.
