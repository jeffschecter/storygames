This is the first time I've played with the new 1.1 rules. Everything went well as usual but I realized that I just don't understand how Bonds are supposed to work.<br/><br/>In the new rules, your Bond score is equal to the number of bonds you have with the other player (max 3), yeah? In addition to guiding roleplaying the relationships between characters, you can roll +Bond to Aid another character. Finally, you can "resolve" a Bond to mark XP and start a new one.<br/><br/>In this game, Eldar has the Bond "I have sworn to protect Sparrow," and Sparrow has "Eldar has my back when things go wrong." (Sparrow's Bond is from the Redbook edition.) These are nice, complementary Bonds, if a little boring.<br/><br/>Where I'm having trouble is when and how these Bonds actually matter for gameplay. It seems like neither is likely to ever be "resolved" - they aren't phrased like keys, so there's no clear fictional trigger for resolution. There doesn't appear to be any other way of gaining XP for acting on a Bond. The Bond score never increases unless they add new Bonds, but there don't seem to be any rules for adding new Bonds except in the event that a Bond is resolved (meaning that your Bond score at character creation will stay the same for the whole campaign).<br/><br/>Help! Do we just need to write more interesting and dynamic Bonds? Is this just a side-effect of playing a two-player campaign? Am I missing something about how Bonds are supposed to work?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362526/#Comment_362526" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T20:07:50+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  8:07PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 8:23PM by Hans_c-o.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Felan</cite><br/>In this game, Eldar has the Bond "I have sworn to protect Sparrow," and Sparrow has "Eldar has my back when things go wrong."

Don't panic. This is all great feedback for Adam and Sage. You are right, the Beta 1.1 rules are a little thin on the ground in the guidance of  using / writing / resolving bonds. I agree that they need to have a BW style belief 'trigger' or narrative based resolution, though most of them can be simply reversed as a resolution trigger.<br/>\n<br/>\n[cross posted] Hans gives excellent advice! Especially about GM agency in 'pushing' on bonds.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour PC's for instance might descide that when Eldar fails to protect Sparrow that their bond is resolved and worthy of a new one, or that an aditional bond be written? The rules don't seem to put a cap on Bonds at the moment, so they seem to be a good XP mine if you can write good bonds and justifiably resolve them (with the consent of the group) within the narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo although the Bonds set at Chargen is a fixed modifier, it can lower as Bonds get resolved and no new ones get added, or increase as new Bonds become apparant between the PCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an optional rule in one or two player games, you might like to consider the idea from AW in the advanced Fuckery Section of giving NPCs bond, therefore increasing the player's workload as they track their various bonds, but increasing the narrative (and XP) potential in low player number games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362535/#Comment_362535" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T21:28:49+00:00" title="February 24, 2012  9:28PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are great suggestions! Thanks everyone.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Hans">@Hans</a>: You're right, I guess I was thinking of them in too permanent terms. Why not have a situation like some of the Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories where they get in a fight and "break up" for a while. Nothing says this can't be a temporary state of affairs - just resolve the new Bond back into the old one when appropriate. (I do think these particular Bonds are a bit less interesting than others, though.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul">@Paul</a>: In the rules, there's nothing. But maybe it's implied that you should add new Bonds whenever it seems right? Maybe there should be a question in the End of Session move that says "Did you get to know another another character better? If so, write a new Bond for them." This could even be an XP move, although it might lead to Bond-hoarding unless there was a max number of Bonds.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Noofy">@Noofy</a>: As above, there doesn't seem to be explicit rules for writing new Bonds, but you're right, that would certainly make it easier to gain XP for two players. Good call on NPC Bonds - I just need to start introducing better NPCs who live longer than a few minutes, hehe.<br/><br/>One possible example of an NPC Bond from tonight's session: Eldar and Sparrow Parley with a fisherman to share his boat as they escape the overrun city. Introduce a new Bond on the spot! "We have agreed to pay Eric the Fisherman 15 gold when we reach safety." Bond resolves either when they pay him, when they renege on the deal, or when Eric gets eaten by a shark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362539/#Comment_362539" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T22:16:10+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 10:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Felan</cite>Nothing says this can't be a temporary state of affairs - just resolve the new Bond back into the old one when appropriate.

I think it would make the bonds more of dynamic, ongoing issues because you'd want to touch on them but you wouldn't be pressured to make them the focus of play or resolve them immediatly.  At the end of the session you would add a +1 to each bond that everyone agreed came up in play and when the bond rolled over, you'd mark XP or if you resolved it you'd write a new one and mark XP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362594/#Comment_362594" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T11:07:20+00:00" title="February 25, 2012 11:07AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the Redbook version, that's basically how it worked, so far as I understand it: each Bond had an individual score that increased over time until it hit 4, at which point you marked XP and reset it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362605/#Comment_362605" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-25T11:34:27+00:00" title="February 25, 2012 11:34AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2012 11:35AM by mease19.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the redbook, your bond was based on the number of bonds you had with someone.
