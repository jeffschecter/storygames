                    Over at <a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Deep in the Game</a> Frank was asking about applying the ideas in <a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2006/02/flag-framing_03.html" rel="nofollow">Flag Framing</a> and <a href="http://bankuei.blogspot.com/2006/02/conflict-web.html" rel="nofollow">The Conflict Web</a> in gamist play, and in particular about what flags you could use in designing gamist adventures. I had been thinking about this question myself, independantly, and decided to post my idea that Cool Powers are gamist flags. This thread is to explain the idea a bit more clearly, and throw it open to analysis by people who (unlike me) have actually designed a story-game.<br/><br/>The idea of Flags in narrativist games is that they highlight which issues and conflicts the players want to explore during play. But gamist play is about addressing challenge in cool ways rather than addressing premise, so the important indicators - flags - for a gamist player should involve
<ul><li>What sort of challenges the player wants to address in play</li>
<li>The cool ways that the player wants to overcome those challenges</li>
And it seems to me that the part of the character sheet that indicates these things most clearly are the Cool Powers that a player chooses for his character.<br/><br/>Examples of the kinds of Cool Powers that I'm talking about (although it should be fairly obvious):
<ol><li>Feats and Class Abilities in D&amp;D/d20 (and class choice itself is also a lesser flag in this regard).</li>
<li>Secrets in The Shadow of Yesterday (even though TSoY isn't first and foremost a gamist-supporting design).</li>
<li>The Cool Powers that the players choose from among those available to their character in the gamist design Victor Gijbers has been discussing on <a href="http://gamingphilosopher.blogspot.com/2005/12/monsters-we-slay-cool-powers.html" rel="nofollow">his blog</a>.</li>
</ol></ul>
The heart of my idea for gamist flagging is that, once you have identified the Cool Powers has at their disposal, the GM should design every encounter (or other challenge) in such a way that one or more of the Cool Powers from each character can have a significant impact on the group's success.<br/><br/><em>Example</em><br/><br/>In a standard D&amp;D campaign, the players have designed
<ul><li>A Fighter who has the feat <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#combatReflexes" rel="nofollow">Combat Reflexes</a></li>
<li>A Cleric with the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#extraTurning" rel="nofollow">Extra Turning</a> Feat</li>
<li>A ranger with the feat <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#improvedInitiative" rel="nofollow">Improved Initiative</a></li></ul>
For the Fighter to show off, he wants to be in the middle of a horde of creatures where he will get planty of chances for attacks of opportunity. The Cleric's player has clearly indicated that he wants to fight lots of undead. The Ranger's player wants to be able to get off the first shot/blow more often than not.<br/><br/>One idea for an encounter that allows the players to show off their abilities would be a room in a dungeon that contains a horde (size depending on the party's overall power level) of skeletons.  That works off of both the Extra Turning feat (they're undead) and the Combat Reflexes feat (it's a horde, so the Fighter can plunge into the middle of them), plus they're relatively slow, so the Ranger has a very good chance of having the initiative on them.<br/><br/>Let's crank it up a notch, though.  Rather than having the number of skeletons appropriate for the power of the party, let's make them a little too strong for the party to handle in a head-on faceoff.  The players should get ample warning that this is the case, of course.  But, it turns out, there are two entrances to the room the skeletons are in which are directly opposite each other.<br/><br/>This can lead to the possibility of the following plan on the part of the players:<br/><br/>The fighter circles around to the "back entrance" while the ranger and the cleric go in the front door.  At the front door, the Ranger can use his Improved Initiative to (with a little luck) get in the first couple attacks, creating breathing room for the Cleric, so he can turn a bunch of the skeletons right off the bat.  This would drive the fleeing skeletons into the Fighter (who's at the other door), allowing him to cut them down as they go by using his Combat Reflexes.<br/><br/>[/Example]<br/><br/>For low intensity encounters, the use of a Cool Power should make the encounter noticably less difficult, while in Big Boss encounters, appropriate use of Cool Powers on everyone's part should make the difference between success and failure.<br/><br/>So, I ask
<ul><li>Does this seem like an appropriate concept for Gamist flags?</li>
<li>How can this approach be incorporated more directly into gamist-supporting design?</li></ul> </div>

One thing folks are learning as gaming advances is that scene framing is applicable to every CA. And given that, there is no reason flag framing can't be used as a technique in a gamist game. There is no doubt that "cool powers" are flags. It's also worth noting that flags need not be mechanical either. If a player expresses a desire to fight some particular type of opponent, that's just as much a flag as something written on the character sheet (though I guess from a strict standpoint, flags are things on the character sheet and that flags are one of many indicators of a players interest).<br/>

                            Here's a thought:<br/><br/>Each Kewl Power is rated in some kind of theme or challenge points- these points the players never use, but becomes a pool from which the GM must use up every session/adventure/whatever.  <br/><br/>"Between a Fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Cleric, we've got 12 Fighty points, 6 Magic Points, 4 Sneaky Points, 3 Holy Points, 9 Explorey Points, and 4 Socialness Points."<br/><br/>Then each encounter uses a certain number of those points.  Levels or some other effectiveness rating caps the maximum amount of points that can be spent from one category at a time.  <br/><br/>"Hmm, Zombies?  Those are 3 Holy and 5 Fighty points, if we add some traps, like say a pool of light poison they have to fight in, that's another 5 Explorey points!  Sounds good!"<br/><br/>This also helps with one of the key problems of D&amp;D-esque games- that specific powers can be more important than raw CR rating for determing the real difficulty of the encounter.  Perhaps when applying encounters that go "above budget" in points ("Hey, there's 2 extra Magic points in this encounter"), the group gets extra XP or reward.<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that things like Life Paths and Background Options can also provide flags for GMs to use.  I mean, even R-maps could work for Gamism.  They just haven't been used in that way yet, I don't think.<br/>

                            Basically, Gamist flags need to be focused on the creation of challenges.  Whether or not they are resources is immaterial.<br/>
<br/>
Note that D&amp;D feats don't act like Flags well -- the game is too easy if your feats always apply.<br/>

I'm definately with Ben on this.  They need to focus on large scale events, not a reusable resource.  Altho those might be mini-flags, they aren't on the level that we're talking about.  They should represent signigicant challenges in the characters life.<br/>

                            First, let me say that this is an AWESOME idea. Kudos to bankuei and Linnaeus.<br/>
<br/>
You know, creating some of the challenges, in D&amp;D at least, might not be so hard. Nearly everything gets capped or scaled by level already - skills, saves, base attack, etc. If you want an average challenge to be, say 75% likely to be defeated, you can set a DC 5 points above the characters' skills (or their expected ratings since most DMs don't keep detailed track of all their PCs skill ratings). It seems that one might be able to make a table with DC on one side and, say, equivalent sneaky points on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
Combat is harder, of course, as are challenges in games that aren't level-capped or have significant social conflict systems. But if it just comes down to a skill check or three, it seems like it wouldn't be that hard.                        </div>
