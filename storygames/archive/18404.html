But I can't afford $540+tax all by my lonesome. So I'm looking for roomies, and I suspect I'm not the only one. So does anyone else need crashspace? Which days would you be going? What's the max per night you can contribute? Are there any requirements you have (for example, single gender, must have bed, no gorillas) for staying? Has anyone actually made reservations already, as I haven't, and won't until I know I have someone to help share the financial load?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
