Take the World of Darkness: Vampires are rapists. Werewolves accept bestiality. Changlings have oppression superpowers. Prometheans learn to be human by harming others. Demons utterly destroy someone's soul just to maintain a cover. Wraith <i>literally</i> has you playing someone's Shadow.<br/><br/>Beast, well Beast.<br/><br/>Thing is I don't know what the answer is. I am not these monsters, yet on some level I identify with them. But what does that mean? What does that say about me?

And if an author can't determine what their stories <i>mean</i>, then how can stories be used to communicate anything at all?\n<blockquote>A little concerned with the implication that theatre and literature are better understood as a way actors and writers can become rich and famous, but - for Hasimir's sake - I'm not going to derail the thread.</blockquote>\nYet a lot of people consume media in those terms. It's why we have 'celebrity culture'. People try to put things into terms they understand and which fit their values, and conflicts can occur when those diverge too much from reality.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, that's also why threads derail <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456290/#Comment_456290" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-14T02:53:10+00:00" title="September 14, 2016  2:53AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 14, 2016 2:53AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An actor interprets Iago's choices when Iago is acted (and a director when directed, etc.).

Sure, they take the idea of playing monsters as their foundation, but several of these games (can't say all, since I haven't really read all of them), thematically, don't really require that you play amoral, horrible people. You frame Changeling as "oppression superpowers," but I feel like its default setting actually allows for some of the most traditionally heroic fiction in the NWOD. The primary motivation of the players in Changeling, at least in my looking through the core rules, seems to assume an interest in protecting the community against extra-dimensional big bads and corruption from within, since the only hope for Changelings is to stand together, or to fall into slavery. Similarly, I've been thinking of running a Promethean game in which queer kinship replaces the quest for humanity (which I always hated about the setting). Even in the default setting, the Created don't hurt people because they WANT to -- for the most part, it's the GM that's going to do most of the hurting. Playing monsters isn't necessarily ALWAYS about playing bad people, it's about creating narrative tension. Some people are going to use it as permission to play jerks (or murderhobos), sure, but I think this gets back to where there's a far wider range of interpretive possibilities for these games than you necessarily assume.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456310/#Comment_456310" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-15T18:18:13+00:00" title="September 15, 2016  6:18PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Seriously though, in what context are we <i>interpreting</i> these things when we ditch the author? Personal experience? Cultural zeitgeist? </blockquote>\nYes and yes? Aren't those the contexts by which you'd interpret an author so you - in your model - could interpret their art? I mean, there's a whole bunch of contexts in which to view art: the demands of the author, or their backstory, isn't the principal one. <br/><br/>Case in point: you pick up a book. It is marketed as a tragedy. There is a missive from the author at the start informing you that this book is meant to make you sad and should be interpreted as such. <br/><br/>Now, you read the book and it hasn't make you sad. In fact, it's all pretty laughable! So, either you have defied the author's instruction, failed to appreciate their ability, or think the book has failed as a work of art. Whichever way, you are clearly refusing the author's interpretation of their own work. <br/><br/>Does that make it any less art? Is it actually a comedic classic to be remembered through the ages? Is the author's intent relevant when you are considering your personal opinion, or is it just hearsay? <br/><br/>You could side-step these questions and claim that the market - the sheer profitability of the thing - defines whether the work has <i>merit</i>, but you would be failing to understand anything about art, beauty or human volition.

An author may be improvising a meaningless stream of thought, and yet our beautiful human minds will seek out meaning for ourselves. It's how come we all have different opinions. I can try and persuade you of a thing, but being maximally persuasive isn't the same as telling a perfect story.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_456637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456637/#Comment_456637" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-27T11:05:19+00:00" title="September 27, 2016 11:05AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've been thinking of running a Promethean game in which queer kinship replaces the quest for humanity (which I always hated about the setting).

Nevertheless they harm others <i>just by existing</i>, or at the very least are giving greater ability and opportunity to do so. This is also true of Monsterhearts, which in many ways handles the same themes more deftly.<br/><br/>Finally, the interpretations in my examples are intentionally the most bad faith possible. Of course there's a far wider range, but the trouble with metaphors is they mean all the things all at once, so you can always focus on the negative.\n<blockquote>Case in point: you pick up a book.
