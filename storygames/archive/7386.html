What is your game about?<br/><b>Each Star Could Be An Ally!</b> is about hot-blooded humongous mecha badassery in the face of an eeevil foe, with the careful (or not) forging of alliances on the way.  It is the Tengan Toppa G-Gundam to Bliss Stage's Neon RahXephon Bokurano.<br/><br/>2.) What do the characters do?<br/>Kick the shiny metal asses of the robotic Von Neumans back to the Core, and hopefully into the singularity there, whilst trying to make friends that help you along the way (sometimes this involves kicking thier fleshy alien asses).<br/><br/>3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?**<br/>The players mow through mooks, trying to outdo each other's Holy Shit Quotients before taking too many losses: impressive maneuvers fill up a collective "Flow" meter in order to power up impressive weaponry.<br/><br/>Then they spend their Flow on forming various Ultimate Weapons which can be used to complete true objectives. When you win an Objective, you gain points of Glory (or sommat) that can be spent on forging alliances in Interludes.<br/><br/>Strategically, you need to win a galaxy: the GM puts out a galactic map at the beginning of the game, and you need to take sectors.  Vonners are weak/few far from the Core, but build reinforcements if unopposed over a length of time. <br/><br/>4.) How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?<br/>I'd like to have a transhuman/posthuman diaspora vibe were aliens = former humans, but other than the fact that this gives the players an immediate excuse to help / demand the help of the "aliens..." <b>Thoughts?</b><br/><br/>5.) How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?<br/><br/>I'm tempted to make a a Motivation -&gt; Fear system, where you risk Fears to use Motivations?  <b>Help me out with this one...</b><br/><br/>6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?<br/>Hot blood and badassery.  Plain and simple.  ...Possibly angst in tolerable levels?<br/><br/>7.) How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?<br/>You fill up the Flow meter by impressing the GM and other players: and the Flow meter is what wins you objectives.  You must literally entertain with over-the-top maneuvers or die.<br/><br/>8.) How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?<br/>Player Intent, Initation, and Execution cannot be blocked: Effect can.  Players describe the actions of thier characters and of the personal Allies of other characters: the GM narrates the actions of enemies and "Potential Allies," biological foes as opposed to the robots.<br/><br/>9.) What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation? (i.e. What does the game do to make them care?)<br/><i>"Against cutting steel and icy if-then statements, our best weapon is smouldering lust and incandescent rage!"</i> Each player creates and stats thier own Potential Ally race and the strength of the Potential Allies could wane, making it possible for the Vonners to decimate them.  Seeing your own personal race, the accomplished empaths known as the Ng'anda, <i>die in droves, screaming at the pain of their brothers on the front</i> would get your attention... <b>Thoughts?</b><br/><br/>10.) What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?<br/>Players have to get as much Flow as a group as quickly as possible, but this is done by rolling dice in Motivations and therefore risking Fears.  <b>I think.  Unless you can help me develop a better system?</b>  Also: Forming Blazing Sword and blowing the holy hell out of a bad guy requires an action but is otherwise automatic at <i>foo</i> Flow (and I need to solve for Foo).  <br/><br/>11.) How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?<br/>Making the PC's even more bad-ass because they're getting Chumbawumba-ed ("I get knocked down...")?<br/><br/>12.) Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?<br/><br/>Objectives completed in combat go into a pool shared by the party: they can be spent, by individuals, on (for lack of a better term) Interludes.  Interludes can snag you Allies, which give you additional abilities / limbs for your mecha, or improve ones you already have, or wear away at enemy Influence on Potential Allies.<br/><br/>13.) How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?<br/><br/>It emulates the genre, that's for DAMN sure.  <b>Again, suggestions on thematic advancement?</b><br/><br/>14.) What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?<br/><br/>Unabashed, guilty-pleasure fun, people quoting TTGL (whether they realize it or not: <b>"WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!?"</b>) and <b>dropped jaws.</b><br/><br/>15.) What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?<br/><br/>The enemy, the better to hate them with.  The history and culture of Earth, both to ground the players in a culture and to emphasise the "They used to be human..." angle.  The mecha, by contrast, are deliberately left fairly undefined, as are the nature of the splinter races.<br/><br/>16.) Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in? Why?<br/><br/>Seeing how absurdly, suicidally audacious people get in Actual Play.<br/><br/>17.) Where does your game take the players that other games can't, don't, or won't?<br/><br/>Into the cockpit of a super robot.<br/><br/>18.) What are your publishing goals for your game?<br/><br/>Small print run, sell and demo at Anime cons (as opposed to gamer cons), PDF for slow trickle of sales, word-of-mouth advertising and cheap viral advertising.<br/><br/>19.) Who is your target audience?<br/><br/>Anime fans, Super-Robot fans in particular, who probably haven't gamed before.  If reciting the "Shining FINGER!" speech makes someone grin uncontrollably, that person is in my audience.<br/><br/>Thoughts on my bolded questions?

More mecha games.  My personal philosophy is that there can never be enough mecha games.  Take that Matthew Gandy!<br/><br/>In response to your questions...I like the posthuman/transhumans a lot, but it does feel a bit limiting.  There is no reason not to include aliens on the list of well aliens.  In fact, there are several reasons to include aliens including: 1) they do cool shit humans can't.  2) They have some weakness that can be exploited to make them allies or make them easily defeated.  Then again, the setting is all yours.  For some reason it just makes sense to me that Flaming Laser Sword only gets better when you throw in an alien power cube.<br/><br/>I like the idea of my Ally race being threatened.  That's pretty cool.  The thing about my race is that I already feel like I like my ally race more than I like my own.  Especially because from your description my race seems to be using other races to shield them against the bad guys.  That means I'm a bad person.  Which, is frankly, really cool for a game.  It does mean that my hopes and dreams for not being a jerk appear to be tied to my ally race.  Which means I need to get in my lion and go kill something.<br/><br/>Can we delve into your resolution mechanics a bit more?  Are you using Flow in the Project Donut sense?<br/><br/>Can pilots improve?  On the whole, I am okay with your advancement mechanic except for my comment below...<br/><br/>I THINK YOU ARE ELLIOT BELSER!  (It was a bolded question...)<br/><br/>Okay...so here's my thought.  The ally race feels like the awesome sauce here.  It's different.  You have mecha defenders of the universe and ally races you have to defend.  They need to do something cool in the game.  They need to improve and help improve your mecha I feel.<br/><br/>Maybe I am missing the point.<br/><br/>The thing I love about this, we're both hitting anime mecha and doing it in totally different ways.  Good on ya man!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164307/#Comment_164307" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T21:43:42+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  9:43PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh and if you are serious about 19...that's a tough one.

This Potential Ally may re-roll dice placed in any Ally's Safety (apart from this one) equal to your Ice stat: treat this as Cautious if they are not currently Allied with a player.  This effect is cumulative across multiple Allies. <br/>- '''Industrious.''' This Potential Ally gains an additional point of Drive each time they complete an objective.<br/>- '''Passionate.''' Treat the Fire stat of this Potential Ally or anyone they are Allied with as if it were 1 higher.  You may pick this twice if the race is Scarred.<br/>- '''Scarred.''' This potential ally has 3 scars and two advantages.<br/>- '''Spiritual.''' This Potential Ally has 4 points of Fear, rather than 5.<br/>- '''Tactical.'''
