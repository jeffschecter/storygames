                    I'm planning on starting the advert drumbeat for the Mix-O-Tronic Challenge soon (likely Monday or Tuesday), and I have one final (big) wrinkle to figure out:<br/><br/>The Challenge works like this: each contestant gets a four-term hit from the Mix-O-Tronic (say ... dinosaurs : God : Donnie Darko : family), of which they must incorporate three of the terms in their design - each contestant gets a different four-term hit.<br/><br/>The other half of the challenge is the integration of different game items: poker chips, playing cards, a modified Monopoly board, Legos, chess pieces ... etc.  Right now, I have it specified that you have to include between 2-5 items in your design - and the field is wide open.  As long as you can either clearly articulate (or link to) what you're using, it's copacetic.<br/><br/>I'm wondering, though, if I should make an 'Officially Sanctioned List' of items that people can integrate.  It'd be long (very long), but it wouldn't be completely wide open.<br/><br/>The third option is to make a much smaller Official List, but then allow people to invent new items (say, papercraft dice or something).  The only downside to that is the fact that you wouldn't know for sure if it's an original idea or not without a lot of research.<br/><br/>Which of these three appeals the most?  <br/><br/>(And I hope folks here have time to participate over the next couple of months.  The site is <a href="http://mixo.challenge.elseworld.org/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)                </div>

                            Hey dude, I would say totally sign yourself up for the Wiki, add a "Contest/Challenge" entry to the front page, and link your Mix-A-Tronic thing there.  Hopefully it will get some attention there.<br/><br/>Since you say "Over the Next Couple of Months", I'm assuming that you don't have to do it in a set period of time?  If not, that will be awesome (I think there might be a few too many time-restrictive contests at this point, I'm hoping to see more "Feel free to engage in it anytime" contests).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
