<a href="http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/2/21701757/" rel="nofollow">http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/2/21701757/</a><br/><br/>There is some great stuff here that is relevant to many of our games. Here's an excerpt where the author is discussing the biology of <i>The Incredicble Shrinking Man</i> and his battle against the spider:<br/><br/><i>As for the contest with the spider, the battle is indeed biased, but not the way the movie would have you believe. Certainly the spider has a wicked set of poison fangs and some advantage because it wears its skeleton on the outside, where it can function as armor. But our hero, because of his increased metabolic rate, will be bouncing around like a mouse on amphetamines. He wouldn't struggle to lift the sewing needle--he'd wield it like a rapier because his relative strength has increased about 70 fold. The forces that a muscle can produce are proportional to its cross-sectional area (length squared), while body mass is proportional to volume (length cubed). The ratio of an animal's ability to generate force to its body mass scales approximately as 1/length; smaller animals are proportionally stronger. This geometric truth explains why an ant can famously life 50 times its body weight, while we can barely get the groceries up the stairs; were we the size of ants, we could lift 50 times our body weight, too. As for the Shrinking Man, pity the poor spider.</i><br/><br/>-- Doug                </div>
