"Let's roll to make your character stop talking in that voice. You sound like Christian Bale as Batman!"<br/><br/><a href="http://smodcast.com/episodes/the-adventures-of-smiddle-earth-as-taken-from-the-journal-of-the-whills/" rel="nofollow">http://smodcast.com/episodes/the-adventures-of-smiddle-earth-as-taken-from-the-journal-of-the-whills/</a><br/><br/><br/>Five Minute Claymation Summary:<br/><a href="http://smodcast.com/episodes/crimson-mystical-mages/" rel="nofollow">http://smodcast.com/episodes/crimson-mystical-mages/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347591/#Comment_347591" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-01T22:25:21+00:00" title="November  1, 2011 10:25PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure Kevin Smith hasn't come up around here before, or I probably would have noticed.<br/><br/>This episode is funny, and also slightly painful because Kev does just about EVERYTHING a horrible GM does.<br/><br/>It's also funny hearing Mewes, the only one who actually plays D&amp;D, actually trying to play D&amp;D, while everybody else is just recording a comedy podcast.<br/><br/>A couple times on Jay &amp; Bob Get Old, they talk about Mewes painting 40K orc armies while he's a junkie living in hotel rooms and such, which is also pretty surreal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
