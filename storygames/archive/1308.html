                    It's a question I've had rattling around my mind for a few weeks. Why aren't there any story games/ indie rpgs on the major contemporary political topics? <br/><br/>I'm not saying that there SHOULD necessarily be games about the conflict in Iraq or terrorism or immigration or climate change or whatever- just wondering why there haven't been any visible up to this point. <br/><br/>Is it because games aren't a good format for addressing contemporary politics ? Because most people enjoy political/moral situations in their games but not the ones they read about day in day out? Because there are some Iraq/security state/globalization etc games in the works that I'm not aware of? Because some recent games are really about Iraq/9-11 etc, just clothed in other forms (ie ditv dogs are actually the taliban, paranoia xp as the patriot act rpg, etc)?                </div>

                            Pinnacle Empty Quiver was an attempt to address the issue of terrorism by forcing the players into a choice: loved ones or the enemy. Revision that works on its way. Hopefully, by Christmas.                        </div>

                            Some recent addresses of the issue have been pretty explicit:  the cover of Luke's <i>Jihad</i> supplement for Burning Wheel features a whole bunch of religious desert zealots about to behead a crew-cut soldier in BDUs.                        </div>

                            I find it distasteful, in any form.  You're talking about making a game as entertainment (or edutainment) based on a conflict where 100-200 people a day are winding up splattered all over the streets of their country or dumped into mass graves or showing up at the morgue in truckloads.<br/><br/>If you want to address the issues, then do it allegorically.<br/><br/>But Iraq: The Quagmiring?  Not cool.<br/><br/>[Edit: I have other issues with this topic, mainly because the fuckers at KUMA|WAR are doing just this, and it mucks about with my Google results.  I've gotten hate mail.]                        </div>

                            I can't stay away from international politics, and it colors my games.  <em>FLFS</em> is about imperialism, especially that potent cocktail of imperialism combined with hypocrisy.  <em>Agora</em> is about millenialism, political sacrifices, and formulating both an agenda and a message.  <em>Sons of Liberty</em> will be all about America and its foundations.<br/><br/>So while none of the games are directly <em>about</em> the Global War on Terror or whatever they want to call it today, I don't think I could write a game that's unaffected by the geopolitical context in which I write.                        </div>

                            Bryan, Pinnacle wasn't one of the games I reviewed during game chef but now I remember the basic concept. I'll check it out when it's released. <br/><br/>Tony, I had read through Jihad but the Dune vibe had stuck more strongly with me than the contemporary link (despite the big flag of the title/ cover). I'll take another look.<br/><br/>Joshua, which is probably one of the reasons I enjoy flfs &amp; agora. I'm looking forward to being a son of liberty. Ironically with my nine tyrant games we have kept a sort of barrier at the late 1970s and haven't played any of them in the right now, but I'm sure some of the play tests have been colored by the trials of hussein &amp; milosevic &amp; (hopefully) pinochet &amp; other recent developments.<br/><br/> Andy,  I think I would have tolerance for an occasional follow the headlines game but wouldn't want contemporary issues to be all I played.<br/><br/>Kuma, I get what you're saying in terms of the coyboys &amp; indians aspect. In terms of poor taste I would defer to anyone in my group in terms of them not wanting to touch on certain topics or representations, but personally would find a game of graphic violence in iraq less problematic than news coverage about violence in iraq that refuses to depict what graphic violence looks like. Maybe I'd change my mind if I played an iraq story game (or one of those missions from the site you mention)                        </div>

                            I think allegory is the way to go as well.  I've got this idea rattling around (it's in the queue but pretty far down) that has the players portray both individuals and factions in an occupied country in a post-collapse future - insurgents, local militias, foreign peacekeepers, etc.  And the game is explicitly set in the town you live in.  So my group would be dealing with suicide bombers, rival theocratic zealots, and Chinese peacekeepers in Durham, North Carolina.  No message beyond that.<br/><br/>"South of Alston avenue and west of the ball park (now a graveyard), UNPROFOR has nominal control, but the real power lies with the Provo troops out of Fayetteville, who get arms from the Fort Bragg phalangists and still support the U.S. government.  What remains of the Duke campus is an absolute no-go zone for journalists - completely controlled by the Baptists.  If you head up 15-501 toward Chapel Hill, a pair of leftist militias are slugging out for control of the University..."                        </div>

                            Dude. Writing a game about this shit is hard. It was hard enough to convince myself that I wasn't being a soulless ass by writing <b>carry</b>. I've had people ask me whether it could be used for Iraq, or whether its about Iraq*. I would love to see an AP of someone who played that. But writing a game (consciously using the word game here, not just as a label) about something where actual people have died is not the easiest thing in the world. Jason has had the same issues with Grey Ranks.<br/><br/>I mean, I've had multiple person say "I really respect that you've done this, but I won't be reading/playing it. It's too raw." And thats <i>Vietnam</i>. <br/><br/>We need perspective on these kinds of things before they can turn into meaningful entertainment.<br/><br/>*The answers are yes and no, respectively.                        </div>

                            The problem, I think, with games (or anything) that are directly about timely events is that eventually, the event is no longer timely (and can seem outdated, etc. - you see this a lot in comedy acts).  Allegories, on the other hand, are more timeless, because while they certainly can illustrate and reference direct events, even as the direct event fades into history, a good allegory remains strong (and often can apply towards new things as time passes).                        </div>

                            I'm working on / waiting to start working on "We All Had Names", concerning a Jewish family before, during and after WWII. It's not going to be a fun game. However, I hope it will be a strong experience, provoking positive thought and possible personal change and growth.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that we should be able to do the same things that are being done in literature, film and comics. People will read Anne Frank's Diary, watch Schindler's List and read Maus. Not everyone will want to read or watch those works, and those who do so aren't in search of light entertainment. Serious games must communicate strongly that they're of a different kind than games meant specifically for entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
If one were to make a game about a contemporary conflict, I think a good approach would be to make a small series of games, illuminating the issue from different angles. The situation in Iraq - or anywhere - is far too complex to be understood or interpreted by just one game experience.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I believe - as I think Kurt Vonnegut mentioned somewhere - that imagination, the ability to put yourself in someone else's head and heart, is the best inoculation against the potential to commit atrocities. This is, to me, the strongest possible incentive to make a role-playing game about a contemporary situation - or, even better, about a potential future area of conflict.                        </div>

this is how I approached the topic of dictators in Heads of State. For a series on iraq it would probably work better with different authors contributing different games/perspectives                        </div>

Ironically I have a game project on wars, beauty &amp; meaning that starts with generic rules for playing soldiers in a conflict. Then as play starts, participants choices move their war into one four categories: beautiful/ purposeful, ugly/ purposeful, beautiful/ nihilistic &amp; ugly/ nihilistic and the rules shift depending on which quadrant/type of war play is in. So I had to figure out what a 'beautiful' war would be and am drawing upon the futurists, enrst junger &amp; others who saw wars as providing the most striking &amp; important experiences of life. I'm also leaning on video games, anime &amp; other depictations of war as a ballet of force, with the focus on weapons &amp; kinetics rather than consequences.                        </div>

                            Hmm, I bet there *have* been alot of games about 9/11---but you have to look at the themes of the games, not at the literal interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
Here's an example---on NPR a while ago they were talking about the movie "The Day after Tomorrow" where the oceans stop and there's mass chaos including a giant snow storm. What the commentator said was that the paranoia and dread in that movie had its roots in 9/11. In other words, even though the movie didn't have a thing to do with terrorists, it was nonetheless an attempt to deal with the fear and unease caused by the terrorist attacks.<br/>
<br/>
I bet its the same with RPGs. I bet if you surveyed the games that came out (or were proposed) over the last 5 years you would find alot of games with that type of dark outlook. (Hmm, does <i>The Mountain Witch</i> contain some? I'm not sure, if it does than it was subconscious.)                        </div>

<p>I've thought about it, because a lot of important stuff is tied up in the current wars, but I get stymied ultimately by thinking: if someone who served in Iraq came up to my table, would they feel understanding, or would they be disgusted, or perhaps worst of all: <em>would they feel used</em>? Basically, I think it's too soon to address this all directly, for me at least.</p>

                            One day, just before GenCon I think it was, an idea struck me so hard that I felt compelled to make a game out of it. I was reading the graphic novelization of the 9//11 Commission Report on Slate.com.<br><br>Since that day, I can't even find a place to start. It's like picking a scab for me. I doubt I'll ever make the game. (That's especially true because future events may make the game concept, um, obsolete.)<br><br>I considered the allegory angle. I found it too cowardly for my tastes on this particular issue. Normally, I have all kinds of fun with allegory.

Each time I think I find one, I realize later that it's really another uncertainty in disguise. Who are we as Americans? As people? Who are others as people? As their nationality? Is nationality relevant? What should we do about lose-lose situations? Has violence gone too far? Too little? Etc. etc. <br/><br/>I think much of this will shake out differently in, oh 20 or 30 years. Sometime. But, these questions are ripe for meaningful exploration. There's a game there. There are probably 100 games there. I can't yet bring myself to unearth them.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think a big problem with making any "story game" with a tight focus on "current events" is that the game will naturally reflect the writers own opinions about those events. It's right up there in the design process, starting with "what do the characters do?" and "what is the reward system based upon?"<br/>
<br/>
For history that is sufficiently "old" for a consensus to form (Nazis are bad) or people to get less upset about what happened, this is less of a problem. For events which are more current and more disputed (and therefore more interesting), people are going to get upset. And the author is more likely to want to <i>make a statement</i>, which gets in the way of allowing the players to make their own.<br/>
<br/>
(Note: making a game that makes such a statement isn't a bad thing. However, it's likely to provoke a backlash from somewhere.)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I could completely see 9/11 as a PTA session - players only bring Issues to the table that they have authored themselves. It would still be heavy stuff, but if your group can handle it, then why not? It's a healthy thing.                        </div>

                            A while back Holistic put out "Afghanistan d20" as part of their "<a href="http://www.holistic-design.com/introRLR.htm" rel="nofollow">Real Life Roleplaying</a>" line, so it's not like it hasn't been tried in RPG form before. The one <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_6872.html" rel="nofollow">review</a> I found on RPGnet is very positive (a realistic, well-researched and informative look at the region and situation), but dismissive of controversy. Of course, browsing their website it seems Holistic also did a d20 game about the Rapture, so I'm guessing they don't care too much about controversy either.<br><br>Video games have gone into some places where RPGs haven't (as far as I know), including obviously exploitative takes on the Gulf War and even the assassination of JFK (no joke; it was called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFK:_Reloaded" rel="nofollow">JFK: Reloaded</a>). The former, from the TV commercials, was obviously a lousy game, and the latter got a lot of media attention and the developers ultimately folded. For that matter, I really have to wonder how, for example, WWII veterans feel about the endless flow of WWII FPS games.<br><br>There was also the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Columbine_Massacre_RPG" rel="nofollow">Super Columbine Massacre RPG</a>, a game in the style of a 16-bit CRPG where you play the role of the shooters. The creator -- who turned out to be a friend of one of the victims -- initially stood behind his creation as an attempt at using the medium as a way to explore the tragedy and the issues it evokes, but later said that video games were the wrong medium for that kind of thing.<br><br>Story games/RPGs are probably a better medium than video games for addressing such topics, partly just because they've moved away from some of the older preconcieved notions of what constitutes valid subject matter, but how much better? Personally, this is exactly the kind of thing I play games to take my mind off of, and I'm not interested in anything that gets closer to modern military stuff than, say,  <a href="http://dsg.neko-machi.com/halo.html" rel="nofollow">Halo</a>. I do think that in their present state story games have the maturity to tackle these kinds of issues, but whether they <i>should</i> is a much stickier question.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I can only agree. I've done writing on WW2 for PEG and many times while I was into it, I got frustrated by the requirement of adding in silly gonzo supernatural elements and rationales for why people killed each other in huge numbers.<br/><br/>Another knock on effect of the experience of writing it is if I do another WW2 game, it's going to be something more like Carry or Grey Ranks where the focus is on the impact of war on the characters, rather than another goddamned equipment list.                        </div>

                            Ben, I'm going to be writing mine for years to come. Burning Sands was the first, Burning Empires the second, and I know that I've got a third in me (at least). MarkV: For me, addressing such themes is about thematic treatment mixed with explicit and fantastical elements, but it's also about how events impact the psyche of the artist. I think it's pretty clear that there is a 100+ storey impact on my psyche.<br/>

                            My response to the destruction of the World Trade Center is revulsion at it's abuse in justification for atrocity, rather than an education in what the real world is to billions of other people.<br><br>I've shelved an idea about the players as the enforcers of a police state and the GM playing a rebel (insurgent) group of their former neighbors, friends and family.

<p>As I said before, if an Iraq vet saw me playing, would they rather see "Dogs in the Valley" or "82nd Airborne"? Which would make them feel more comfortable? (This is aside from what they would themselves play; I'd understand them wanting to bow out of either game.)</p>

Unless the game is written by (or has substantial input by) someone who has been serving in Baghdad, I don't see how it can do anything other than abstract and obfuscate the subject matter.  I mean, does the average soldier in Iraq see themselves as part of some narrative tapestry of the war?  Or are they too wrapped up in the moment-to-moment of trying not to get disintegrated by an IED to think about such things?  Would they want to see their experiences framed that way?<br/><br/>That'd be my requirement for seeing a game based on Iraq: substantial input from a variety of actual vets.  I think it'd be the only way to be intellectually honest about doing it.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>On a tangential point, I'm interested to see that there aren't any proposals for a game made from al-Qaeda's (or at least al-Qaeda operatives') points of view.                        </div>

<p>I think the issue here is not what a soldier â€” few of whom I know â€” would think, but what <em>I</em> think. If I were to write that game, it would be about the stuff I care about: infringement of civil rights at home, attack on our home as an excuse for an attack on an unrelated country, corporate ownership of government. Stuff like that. Stuff that I vote on when I can.</p>
<p>Maybe there would be war in it, but the war would serve my purposes as a designer and as a player, not a hypothetical soldier. I'd probably therefore wind up misrepresenting the war, but I would say what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>War's been pretty misrepresented throughout the media and throughout time, so I don't see why we're beholden to change that here and now.</p>

                            Dogs and MLwM could be pretty obviously adapted to playing Jihadists, though they'd bring a very specific angle to it.<br/><br/>I do think there's a niche for a game organized around the "players are a terrorist cell" premise, though. If I were to do it, the default setting would be in a generic European country in a generic year in the 1800s.                        </div>
