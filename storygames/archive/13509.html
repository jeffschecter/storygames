In practice I find it leads to aspect grubbing--looking to ram those square-shaped Aspects into the round hole of the conflict's context. I'm not asking for a stick to use on players--I think it's always reasonable to look for ways to be effective. I'm noodling on ways to avert this so that players don't feel the need to cast about desperately for effectiveness.</p>\n<p>In an unpublished design I turned the Trait/Tag thing a bit "inside out." That is, if you have Soldier (4), you've got 4 tags beneath it, and they are the ones you may <em>not</em> add to your roll. Fate points could buy you tags under your <em>other</em> Traits. This is cute, however it makes chargen somewhat tricky--you strategize by selecting things under a Trait such that they're only tangentially relevant. To show a degenerate case, a two-Trait character could have Soldier (2): <em>Making do with what's there</em>, <em>Sleep whenever</em>; Cook (2): <em>Handy with a rolling pin</em>, <em>Commanding voice</em>. I don't think it's <em>broken</em> but I'm not in love with it either.</p>\n<p>Diaspora has the idea of "scopes" where an Aspect can only be used once under any scope--your character, a target character, an ally, the scene, etc. And, of course, it doesn't try to mash Skills and Aspects together as Lady Blackbird does, which gets you a good ways out of that problem, since Aspects (or Traits, whatevah) aren't your only source of effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Anyone know other design tricks to tackle this issue?</p>\n<p>--JB</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305030/#Comment_305030" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-17T18:35:11+00:00" title="December 17, 2010  6:35PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been trying to work on this issue in the designs I've been working on (such as <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">Final Hour of a Storied Age</a> and the game I was working on for this year's Game Chef). My thinking is that if there are diminishing returns for each additional trait you add to a roll (such as adding a bonus die in a "keep the best N dice" system -- after a certain point adding another bonus die is negligible) and also a downside to adding too many traits (in my original system there's a mechanical downside if you get a 1 on any die, so there's a risk with each die you add -- I've got a slightly different mechanism in my current version of Storied Age) then people won't feel so pressured to grub for traits. (The other thing I'm trying to tackle in my system is the related problem of trait-spamming -- I hate when the same trait gets used over and over again because the repetition tends to suck the energy out of the game, and people start to get lazier about invoking traits that they always invoke -- once it becomes obvious that a trait is going to be used it's much easier to slack off on actually narrating it into the fiction).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305088/#Comment_305088" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-18T18:07:11+00:00" title="December 18, 2010  6:07PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make them add some narration for each one.

You need someone at the table whose responsibility it is to maintain the consistency of the fiction and the authority to shoot down things that don't fit.  Usually that's the DM because, generally, the DM isn't supposed to care about outcomes (while generally speaking, players are).  That allows the DM to play the game without having to work at cross-purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if Lady Blackbird has a DM.  If not, you could say that players who are not involved in the conflict have the responsibility to judge the applicability of traits and tags and the authority to overrule their use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305100/#Comment_305100" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-18T22:07:32+00:00" title="December 18, 2010 10:07PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perfect used to suffer from this. You'd have 3-4 Aspects, and in order to survive in the game you'd be asked to shoehorn those Aspects in to basically every test. There's only so many times that "the memory of my father being carted away" can help you. Hell, there's only so many times that "sneaky" can help you.<br><br>I came up with a couple intermediary solutions, before just straight-up removing them from tests. The best intermediary solution was this:<br/><br/>You have 4 Aspects, but only 2 mechanical powers (say: +2 on any test, +4 if you roll an odd-numbered result).<br/>You invoke an Aspect in order to tag/get one of your two mechanical powers.<br/>But, you're only able to invoke 2 Aspects per test, meaning that you are grubbing or shoehorning.<br/><br/>I playtested that for about a year, and it solved a lot of the frustrations that I had with Aspect-centric play. Setting a hard limit on how many Aspects you can bring into a given struggle is good. But something still felt off/forced about that system. And so I came up with something much more fluid:<br/><br/>You have a Resources score. Let's say you have Resources 6. In every test, you get to invoke that score to get that bonus.<br/>Instead of having canned Aspects, you declare what the points mean as you invoke them.<br/><br/>Say you're running away from a cadre of inspectors, at the docks in the pitch dark of night. They caught you red handed, trying to steal a blacklisted art shipment, perhaps. You might want to say, "I duck behind a large stack of crates, and worm my way into a tiny little nook. That's +2." And then the inspectors fan out and call for back-up, maybe. "Well, I'm going to wait until it's totally silent on the boardwalk that I'm on at the moment, and then I'm going to slip out of my hiding nook and slowly slide myself down into the water. It's freezing cold, but I manage to avoid gasping - slipping silently into the water, and under the docks. +3." And stubborn as ever, the inspectors decide to maintain a stake-out on the dock district all night - they'll catch you eventually. "And for my last point," you say, "When I reach the shore, I'm just going to make a mad sprint towards the safehouse. So, that's my +6 right there."<br/><br/>And then you roll off against each other, to see if you get caught. Ta-da!<br/>In play, people tend to invoke most of their Resources with stuff that reinforces their character concept, occasionally introducing something totally new and surprising.<br/>So: the perfect balance.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305101/#Comment_305101" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-18T22:35:43+00:00" title="December 18, 2010 10:35PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a laundry list of stuff I can think of...<br/><br/>Limits-based ideas:<br/><br/>-- You can put limits on how many can apply at a time. Like scopes. Or in Burning Empires, where it's one skill, one wise for extra dice. Probably players will max out that limit every time.<br/><br/>-- Or limits could vary on the character sheet. You could have a different rating for skill level and for how many aspects you can invoke when using that skill.<br/><br/>-- Or limits could be determined based on what type of action you are performing.<br/><br/><br/>Economy-based ideas:<br/><br/>-- Spending Fate points to invoke aspects.<br/><br/>-- In Mouse Guard, you check off a Trait when you use it and you have to uncheck it. What you need to do to uncheck it could vary.<br/><br/>-- Use it, risk it: You can use whatever you can justify, but if the dice go badly, you can lose what you risk. May or may not be related to winning/losing or success/failure or narration rights.<br/><br/>-- Colour for the action, colour for the consequences. Every aspect you invoke, you give the GM some license to bring in related consequences or results.<br/><br/>-- Or, if you invoke more than X nmber of aspects, another player gets narration rights, you don't. Or every aspect you narrate gives one other player narration rights, so the whole damn table could end up narrating what happens instead of you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305110/#Comment_305110" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-18T23:24:23+00:00" title="December 18, 2010 11:24PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2010 11:26PM by TylerT.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i delt with this sort of thing recently. it's a tricky problem.<br/><br/>In Seed RPG these are called motivations. my goal was to inspire characterful narration and reward it. Characters have a motivation attached to their character' role, body type, and personality.<br/><br/>a motivation reads like this<br/><i>"Caring- I care for others and want to help them. When i act with <b>empathy</b> or <b>passion</b> give me a free die" </i><br/><br/>After rolling dice players narrate their results. if another player or gm feels that player narrated something that hit a motivation they give that player a free die. this die can then be added to any future roll. each motivation can only hold one die at a time (meaning there are limits)<br/><br/>This has been testing well. Some players may reach to hit a motivation but it's usually pretty good narration, given it does not effect the action's success or failure it has less of an "asking momy for a cookie" feel and tend to be used to described both success and failure.<br/><br/>this is more or less possible because my game has no "pre-action" narration                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305135/#Comment_305135" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-19T10:07:01+00:00" title="December 19, 2010 10:07AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>These are great responses, folks, thanks very much. It's interesting to to see the responses reflection where the narration falls in relation to the dice and, if modifiers follow the initial roll, where they fall in terms of declared outcome. Joe's system (like many) pre-loads all narration and the dice decide the outome. Our table's variant on Fate, Diaspora, uses the Fate-point constraint, and nails down the expenditure point to post-roll--as I've remarked in the past, this type of Fate has the die roll just set a cost.</p>\n<p>Tyler, I dig on the other-player-controlled, "pay it forward" idea you have there.

If you use those foldable character sheets like you guys have for Soft Horizon, with the little billboard space, to communicate your flags. And if you have a group already playing FATE or something and always comparing Aspects and compelling/tagging each other, it will probably work just fine. But I can see some groups having a really hard time.<br/><br/>The refresh scenes from Lady Blackbird are a bit similar, actually, where you have a down-time scene that shows your character's character and you get all your bonus dice back.

Each aspect has a side-effect attached to it, if you want the bonus you have to deal with the effect.

Cap stacking, either at a fixed level, or using diminishing returns (eg adding dice and taking the top two rather than adding bonuses.

Restricting the re-use of traits using resource management (eg X times per session, not twice in a row, the bonus lessens)<br/>3. As GM or player, be that downer. People will get used to it, and love you for it, eventually. If necessary use the phrase "douche."<br/>4. Peer pressure, but with "calling out" a less socially awkward thing.<br/>5. Only offer rewards when PCs "lose" (eg Poison'd)<br/>6. Insist on a narratively distinct use of the trait each time.<br/>7. Retrospectively tighten up or change traits which turn out to have too many legitimate uses.<br/>8. If someone in the scene, or even not in the scene, has a more specific skill you can't bring your skill into play. (Mortal Coil). Problem, why shouldn't I use my sword fighting in a duel against a duellist?<br/>9. Offer a bonus each time a different combination of attributes is used until all possible combinations have been used.<br/>10. Be very strict during character creation so you don't have to be later.<br/>11. Let people redefine their traits when they fail / grow bored of them.<br/>12. Make sure that opponents are likely to be susceptible to the traits.<br/>13.

It didn't stop me.<br/><br/>When players abuse systems, my friend Jim is fond of bringing out the window breaking metaphor. No one can stop you from erasing numbers on your character sheet or lying about what you rolled when no one is watching. That doesn't mean the game is broken. RPGs are generally social games that assume you have a functional social group. <br/><br/>But there is a fine line. <br/><br/>RPGs are akin to conversation among friends and systems is the language that constrains that conversation. But what does that language encourage? I've seen the best roleplayers struggle with themselves when trying to decide if they can bs the use of a trait. And often they will decide it doesn't make sense to give in to temptation (often out of guilt). But the mechanics often whisper, "if you can justify this, you can win" and even if you decide after 2 minutes of struggle not to use the trait because it feels cheesy, it's still a tension that may detract from the experience. Especially when usage of certain resources comes with little to no risk. <br/><br/>I like how Mouse Guard handles this. You can only use a single Wise Skill and a single piece of Gear to help yourself. Your friends can help but only with 1 skill and it comes with risk. If you fail, everyone who helped you also suffers a consequence. The risk and limits help streamline the issue. <br/><br/>I like how in D&amp;D 4E now, Aid Another has a scaling difficulty and if you fail, you give a -1 to your friend (vs a +2 for success). In play, it has made a huge difference. The moment of hesitation that the risk of -1 gives you puts into sharp focus the question... does it make sense for me to even help? <br/><br/>But as I mentioned, it is a fine line. I don't like the idea that systems should ignore human limitations or the other extreme that systems should assume the worst in people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305209/#Comment_305209" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-20T09:19:13+00:00" title="December 20, 2010  9:19AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Burning Empires dealt with this elegantly by just placing a hard limit on how much grubbing you're allowed to do.

And you can only choose two, perhaps. So, for instance, you might write, "My father was a drunk, 2d6", and list the trait as (Talking/Fighting). Then you couldn't use that trait in a shootout or a physical conflict, but only when talking or in a brawl.<br/><br/>In the case of a game like Dogs, it could remove some interesting possibilities from the fiction. But if you're aiming for balance and/or consistency, clarity, etc, I think it's one interesting solution, and quite functional. It also communicates a little more about what the player may have meant by that trait or aspect.<br/><br/>Another example:<br/><br/>In a Wicked Age... does this to some extent, by requiring every Particular Strength to list one or two forms which must complement its use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305249/#Comment_305249" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-20T13:39:39+00:00" title="December 20, 2010  1:39PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, interesting point.<br/><br/>I suspect that Dogs is improved by having traits which are simple and straightforward, like "Good with a gun" or "Knows horses". Those traits are easy to narrate into a conflict, it's clear what they cover and what they don't, and they have clear implications for the fiction. I think traits like "My father was a drunk" are likely to be more problematic for many groups. <br/><br/>That's just my suspicion though. I'd be interested in trying that out in practice. I've heard people have had good results with pre-generated characters in Dogs - just young kids with a gun, a horse, and a coat, nothing fancy. That fits with my inclination that Dogs is sometimes better when the characters are cyphers - a front for the players. Sometimes playing a character - taking on a role - can be a shield between you and making judgements, which is what the game is all about.<br/><br/>I think you're dead-on with IaWA, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305250/#Comment_305250" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-20T13:46:01+00:00" title="December 20, 2010  1:46PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Sometimes people say clever stuff in a thread, and because it's smart and obvious in retrospect, no one engages with them.

If you bring in "Good with guns" chances are you're also escalating to gunfighting. It's only when you're using ambiguous traits like "Daddy used to drink" or whatever, that it becomes less clear.<br/><br/>How I see it is that there are two broad schools of conflict resolution: "How Then Why" and "Why Then How". They look like the following:<br/><br/><b>"How Then Why"</b> style is seen clearly in 3ED&amp;D, Apocalypse World, and probably a number of others. It's <i>kind of</i> present in Sorcerer, but not clearly.<br/><br/>You say what your character is doing, and the GM tells you if that requires a dice roll or not. What you're doing gives you a range of possible fictional outcomes, and what you roll on the dice chooses between those outcomes.<br/><br/><b>"Why Then How"</b> style is seen very clearly in Cold City, PTA, and a lot of others. It's pretty much how Dogs works too, but not completely.<br/><br/>You say what your character wants to achieve, and we set stakes. What you roll on the dice determines whether you get what you want, and narration, what dice you rolled, and sometimes other things decides how you get there.<br/><br/>Obviously, in practice most games aren't clearly in one camp or the other, they're somewhere in between. Burning Wheel, for example, is mostly Why Then How, but the way conflicts can be resolved with either a single dice roll, or multiple rolls, gives it some elements of How Then Why.<br/><br/>Is that a useful distinction to make?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305269/#Comment_305269" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-20T14:54:31+00:00" title="December 20, 2010  2:54PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a game I'm currently designing (which is meant for one-shots, much like, say, <i>Shock:</i>) you have Traits, but the mechanical relevance of those is single-use: only by dropping or permanently transforming one you get a concrete bonus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305275/#Comment_305275" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-20T15:32:48+00:00" title="December 20, 2010  3:32PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2010 3:33PM by jenskot.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>John, in your game Blackout, do you risk all the traits that you bring into a conflict?
