I think that the combined imagination of this forum could produce an equally fantastic (and potentially endless) array of corridors, rooms, and so forth. Let's get started!<br/><br/>"The Vermillion Room [West Tower]"<br/><br/>Though the dust and cobwebs have dimmed the brilliant red-orange glow that once glistened with the setting sun, the Vermillion Room carries the stories of a hundred lustful follies. Before the West Tower was abandoned during the floods, rakish princes traded their realms for its temptations, and no lady of the court would dare speak of power and romance without its scarlet hue filtering her mind's eye. The Vermillion Room let fortunes rise and fall by the lace of a dress. Silent, its curtains are now faded and worn, and the rusting lamp on a decaying nightstand is the brightest red it bears.<br/><br/>Your turn! What are some other places in the castle?\\<br/><br/><a href="http://www.mervynpeake.org/gormenghast/gormenghast.html" rel="nofollow">Gormenghast (for the uninitiated)</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397284/#Comment_397284" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-12T19:29:02+00:00" title="November 12, 2012  7:29PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Tiger's Spire<br/>On the western wall, there lies a room painted entirely blue and white. The walls are lined with a silver cage which is constructed in a puzzling fashion that criss-crosses the central area of the tower several times over. There are entrances at ever level of the tower, each leading to a different maze that allows you a glimpse of the hundreds of tigers that occupy the cage, and the dear they hunt. The cage is so vast and complex that the animals live, die, and breed all with in it's confines. No one knows how to open the cage, and no one ever feeds the deer or the tigers. Rumor persists that the only reason the tigers are not locked in, but are merely confounded by the maze so much they cannot find the exit. There are stories of those who get lost in the tower and find themselves trapped inside with the tigers, and even more of the occasional tiger who's cunning was so great that it escaped into the larger castle. Such tigers would be so intelligent in fact, one may not even know it had escaped until they were being eaten by it. That's what the cook believes, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_397290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397290/#Comment_397290" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-12T23:04:37+00:00" title="November 12, 2012 11:04PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gormenghast is one of my favorites! A great work!<br/><br/><b>The Green Gallery</b><br/>Under a soft layer of dust lies the lush green carpet of The Green Gallery. The golden stripes of the greenish tapestry glistening like lost treasures, in between the hundreds of framed portraits, in the light from high windows. The windows so dirty that the light is like remnants of sun-rays reaching a forest floor through dense foliage. <br/><br/>The walls of the gallery is hung with hundreds of portraits. Men and women with high wigs, bleak skin and narrow mouths, in the noble fashion of older days; the days when nobility danced and conversed with style, and ruled supreme. The faces are serious, haughty, self-assured. Some of them clearly men and women in power, with lions and great dogs placed on the floor before them, to signify their supreme power. <br/><br/>It's a belittling experience to wander the long gallery, under the scrutiny of the long dead eyes of the portraits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397297/#Comment_397297" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T01:35:34+00:00" title="November 13, 2012  1:35AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Small Library</b><br/>Hidden away under the stairs that lead down from the Green Gallery to its antechamber is the small library. Accessible only from a trap door which opens in the stairs themselves, one descends a cast-iron spiral staircase, crowded on all sides with the continuous sweep of a single winding shelf. In the tiny space at the bottom of the stairs, there is just enough room for a single chair, a small table sufficient perhaps for a bottle of spirits and a glass, and a fire place. The fire does not draw well and the smoke which escapes up into the library has over the years coated all the spines of the book with a thick layer of greasy soot, so much so that it is impossible to determine a volume from appearance. Those few people who visit wear a thick oilskin apron to avoid staining their clothing.<br/><br/>I had heard that the tomes mainly consisted of treatises on the flora and fauna of the castle and its surrounding area but Manderlay, the footman who maintains the door hinges to the Great Hall once drunkenly whispered to me that his grandfather had been librarian to the Small Library and that it contained the accounts of the sea voyages of the 19th Earl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
