We're continuing a game series that has cropped up over the years, using different systems around a core of repeating characters. It began with Pulp Heroes d20, then shifted into TSoY, and finally Dictionary of Mu before landing in the ultimate pulp system, Spirit of the Century.<br/><br/>So we have a lot of shared history and background to draw on. And this series is pretty much set up to explore that stuff and play around in the sandbox we've made over the years. Chargen was a blast, since the "pulp novel" phases were essentially us cataloging our old games and using them as material for aspects.<br/><br/>So then we're about to start, and I'm looking at my sheet, and I have this moment of regret. I miss my Keys from the TSoY version. I'm looking and I'm like, "This is cool, but my keys gave me such a great roadmap for what to do in a scene. I miss that." But I just shrugged and figured SotC was awesome and it would work itself out.<br/><br/>And it did. Big time.<br/><br/>Aspects are so incredible! I knew this already, but it just got hammered home in play in such a great way. There were compels left and right (GM to player <i>and</i> the other way around) and in a flash the same feeling of structure that Keys gave us re-appeared as if by magic. It's not the exact same thing, of course, but aspects are definitely scratching that itch -- and I guess I didn't expect that.<br/><br/>Here's an example:<br/>My character, Nick Timber, has the aspect "Lovable Fool." When it comes to dames, he just doesn't always think straight, but gosh darn it, you just have to smile at the big galoot. So of course, when we're all at the gala opening of the exhibit of rare Atlantean artifacts -- and waiting for the henchmen to come bursting down out of the skylights -- Nick is approached by an old potential love-interest who invites him to shuffle off to a dark corner for a heart to heart.<br/><br/>Brandon, the GM, holds out the Fate point just as I'm stretching out my hand to ask for it. "Yep, I'm a Lovable Fool. Of course I go with her." Ding. I take the Fate, and it feels like hitting a Key and I realize I know how to play this game after all.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66744/#Comment_66744" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T11:34:37+00:00" title="May  3, 2007 11:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had the same conceptual issues before with my love of TSOY and wanting SotC to 'be more like it'.

But I think the problem is more the hoarding than the supply, if that makes sense.<br><br>Here's what I'm getting at: you addressed (or at least medicated) the hoarding problem by increasing the supply of fate points, but that's not the only way to solve the hoarding problem.<br><br>IMO, it can ALSO be solved by having an explicit, up-front talk before starting the game about how fate points are there to be spent, and if you're looking for more, you need to push your aspects out there to get compelled.  Let them know that as the GM you WANT to compel their aspects, but you might not always be on top of those aspects being compel targets, so you need their help to identify when the story's tripping over them.<br><br/>Essentially this second approach is ALSO addressing the hoarding problem by supply, but it's putting the task of achieving the supply more in the players' hands, rather than relying on "gifting" the players with an abundance of FPs to begin with.<br/><br/>My feeling is that compel-seeking is a behavior that will emerge at the table over the course of several sessions of the game.  You don't have that kind of time at a con, but I still think compels should be an active part of the game experience -- so the key is to jump-start players into the emergent behavior within the first 5 minutes of play.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens" title="Robert Ahrens"><img alt="Robert Ahrens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/664/n4GHDX832T7IU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert%20Ahrens">Robert Ahrens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68415/#Comment_68415" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T07:16:38+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  7:16AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2007 7:19AM by Robert Ahrens.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Fred: </b><br/>\nAt SGB, after some brief setup and chargen, we probably gamed for about 2:30 - 3:00 hrs.  Your point about tuning resources to game length is a key one, and it's one that I've wished more games with inbuilt timing mechanisms (Inspectres, Lacuna, virtually all games with Hero Points) would pay some textual attention to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons I really like DRYH is that the "average" cycle of a PC's Exhaustion and Madness is 0 over time.  That means that, regardless of game length, the system works out pretty well.  (Although, obviously, shorter games provide less opportunity for Exhaustion and Madness to get out of hand.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Ryan:</b><br/>\nI'm in no way trying to criticize, but I think that I as a GM in that situation would start to Compel more.  That (to me) sends a message to the players saying, "Hey, you've got these Aspects and I'm making use of them.  Oh, and you've got all these Fate points ... why don't you do something with that?"<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Mike:</b><br/>\nI think you're right that Aspects' uniformity makes them easier to work with.  However, I also like that Keys are tied to character motivations, which means you don't get many Tags of the "I light my lucky cob pipe and ..." type.  I'm thinking of porting Flags of some kind into Wild Talents and I think I will make them uniformly pay out in a two teir structure: 1 Will point for "minor" invocation and 3 for "major".  That should strike a balance between uniformity and sensitivity which I hope to find goldilocks-just-right.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: In TSoY play, I've found that the group instinctively "just knows" when a Key should pay out or not -- it's a very collaborative thing.  Our main trouble was that we could never remember which Keys had a  1/3 structure and which had a 1/2/5 structure, so we kept having to flip around to try and figure out <i>how much</i> the Key had just paid out.  Making everything minor or major, 1 or 3, would (I believe) help clarify that process.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nRobert.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68580/#Comment_68580" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T15:19:38+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  3:19PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Session two of this series was one of the best games I've ever been in.<br><br>We have all internalized the system now, so we're playing it like a piano.

I forgot to answer Fred's questions:<blockquote>Did you adopt any particular behaviors to help streamline the "naturalizing" process? Are stunts an obstacle to this sort of thing, for your group?</blockquote>\nHmmm. Did we streamline the naturalizing process? Maybe.<br><br>One thing we did: after session one, we were debriefing and talking about what happened early in the session. It kicked off with this gala exhibition, with the PCs milling around and being social and setting up what was to come. Much fun roleplaying and several compels. During the debrief, though, we realized that we missed many opportunities to asses, declare, and tag for effect. Someone said, "That whole talk with so-and-so! I should have been maneuvering and declaring aspects on them and stuff!" Lightbulbs went on, like duh! Of course!<br><br/>Another thing: Brandon (the GM) makes these incredible summary sheets and guides that help A LOT. He has this amazing one-pager thing that is a flowchart for conflicts as well as everything you need to know system-wise to attack, block, maneuver, etc. Maybe he'll post a link to it. With this sheet in front of me, not only is it a good reference, but it's a constant reminder that I can (and should) be doing all of those things. I'd say that helped streamline the learning curve a great deal, kind of like the cool rules summary cards from BattleLore.<br/><br/>I don't think stunts are an obstacle, no. We talked about stunts a lot before we played (or, Brandon and I did, anyway) and we could already sort of see behind the curtain on those. Once we could see the structure, I think we found it pretty easy to run with it, or even alter things here and there if we found something odd (like the 2-3 stunts in the game that have unusual costs or limits that don't fit the standard pattern -- Sucker Punch, I'm looking at you).<br/><br/>And I was a little concerned about stunts at first. I thought they might be too much crunch and spot-rulings, but it turns out that there's no problem after all. The players really only need to know their own, and the GM can take some extra time learning the ones he needs when he makes NPCs. So no worries there.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68668/#Comment_68668" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T06:21:46+00:00" title="May 12, 2007  6:21AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Another thing: Brandon (the GM) makes these incredible summary sheets and guides that help A LOT.

The best suggestions mentioned making sure that there are a whole lot of things going on (so, not just combat... but combat while the bomb is ticking down, the crystal men are running off with your girl, and everything is happening in the middle of a crowded shopping complex with tons of civies around).<br/><br/>For me (and the powers at be might frown upon this method, so YMMV), I have had the most luck offering Fate points in combat for things unrelated to actual aspects. So, if a player is hurting for Fate points you might wait for an appropriate moment (i.e. when it is REALLY dramatically interesting) and offer a compel to be 'Out of Ammo'. Or a player might 'lose his balance'... sending him into an excitingly precarious position. Likewise, compels to allow the bad guy to do something that the players don't want to do ("With all that is going on... surely it doesn't hurt anything for Dr. Baron vonEvilstein to push the blinking red burron").<br/><br/>Remember too that you can compel based on setting aspects ("It is so DARK, you don't notice the men sneaking up behind you") or maneuvers that the baddies have placed on him.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that most of these methods should only be employed if it looks like the player needs more Fate points (and in a hurry).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68716/#Comment_68716" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T15:20:48+00:00" title="May 12, 2007  3:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scene Aspects, yeah, I like that as a catch all.

In our group, we use chases as just another form of conflict. In fact, chases are usually our favored way to run social conflicts and investigation scenes. I think chases give SotC a DitV flavor. Basically, you describe whatever you want to do, asign a difficulty for that, and everyone that's trying to stop you in some way can try to match that or give. (This works somewhat faster if you're using -2 -4 -6, and minion style stress)<br/><br/>So, in your example, simply ask the players what are they going to do. Do they hide? Then it's Stealth, and pursuers must use Investigation. Do they run? Athetics vs. Athletics. Do they run while making cover fire? Athletics modified by Guns vs. Athletics. Do they try to disguise themselves? It's Deceit vs. Investigation. Basically, anything you would see a Scooby Do chapter, when the Gang is running from the monster of the week, you could do in a chase scene. The resulting "fiction" should look about the same way.<br/><br/>A few months ago, we ran a pretty tense chase scene in our Middle Earth game. We were pursuing a band of Assassins to their lair, without them finding out we we're following. They used Ride, we used Stealth modified by Ride. Still, the coolest parts of the chase were the maneuvers. My character used Academics to declare a narrow pass ahead, for example; while the Assassin leader used his Survival to set out "Traps" behind them. It was really cool. The only downside I see to chases is that you lose some of the tactical element you have with zones, but, for certain scenes, that's not really an issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brandon%20A" title="Brandon A"><img alt="Brandon A" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fusionofthought.com/pics/handy.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brandon%20A">Brandon A</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73979/#Comment_73979" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T10:42:51+00:00" title="June  6, 2007 10:42AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Doyce.

Since we're talking about a physical pursuit, the physical stress track would be the best, IMHO. As an aside, one of the interesting things about chases is that the pursuer can set a ridiculously high difficulty to 'play chicken' with the opposition. If you have a Superb Stealth, for instance, you can go for a Legendary +2 difficulty: you might get some stress out of the deal, but minions, who have small stress tracks, might want to concede.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74342/#Comment_74342" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T03:04:16+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  3:04AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, OK.

In the case where the pursuer is getting rather too close, and people are having to contain their panic, Composure seems more appropriate. Then again, as you say, sometimes physical harm might be more appropriate, though in the "chicken" situation, I'm having trouble imagining how hiding by Stealth could inflict more physical harm on the pursuer than they can handle.<br/><br/>Can you give an example of how this sort of thing might get narrated in?

It's a physical pursuit, so, IMHO, the stress is physical. I can see the reason for using Composure, but I tend to use composure for Intellectual and Social conflicts (including chases), and leave all the physical stuff physical. There are two important things to keep in mind: first, stress does not represent harm <i>per se</i>, that's the territory of Consequences, and, second, that in SotC chases are not about getting closer or gaining distance, but of dealing with the pursuer in a manner such that he'll not be able to pursue anymore.<br/><br/>In the Stealth example, let's assume you're running form the pursuers and decide to hide yourself in the top of a tree. You set the difficulty as Superb. You roll Stealth (perhaps modified by Athletics), and get Great, so you take a one-point hit. The pursuers roll investigation to follow you (again, modified by athletics) and roll Good. Let's assume that they're three average minions, so two of them are taken out. Now, the GM, or the player, or whomever narrates this sort of things on your table, narrate it as follow: As the PC climbed the tree, he discover it's quite taller than he expected, and truly exhausted himself in the climb (hence the stress), later, the minions come looking for him, looking lost, and the PC jumps form his hiding place, falls on two of them, knocking them down (two taken out) and he makes a run for it again, with the last minion pursuing him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett" title="Dave Hallett"><img alt="Dave Hallett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Hallett">Dave Hallett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74535/#Comment_74535" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-08T13:31:28+00:00" title="June  8, 2007  1:31PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, good example.
