Its not what I asked.  But I'm interested.<br/><br/>HOW do you make an NPC that does this without players immediately "taking them down" the first time they interact?  In my experience when players even whiff that sort of behaviour they immediately look to:<br/>a)  kill the NPC<br/>b)  get the NPC in handcuffs and dismiss them without listening <br/>c)  immediately feel they're superior to the NPC making fun of how "stupid" they are<br/><br/>etc... etc...<br/><br/>So while I'm interested in your idea, I'd like you to explain HOW to get this done in a plot?  Please walk through an example.  I've not see/heard any of your examples, so I can't relate.  Please explain by using one of those ideas, including how the types of players I mentioned above would NOT diffuse said NPC before the plot gets rolling.<br/><br/><br/>I'm looking for interesting plot ideas.  This CAN be the crux of a plot idea to make any old murder plot interesting ...  but I need to understand HOW to do it.  I learn best by examples, unfortunately your notes while interesting don't help me understand how this can be done/shown in game.<br/><br/><br/>Anyone's welcome to help add/explain...<br/>thanks for your help.<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178631/#Comment_178631" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-13T23:54:26+00:00" title="November 13, 2008 11:54PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say behavior a is your only problem, though it can have its own complications. <br/>\n<br/>\nb. slap 'em in handcuffs and dismiss them: this only works until someone else dies as a result of the killer's perfectly perpetrated plan<br/>\nc. oh yeah, stupid villain.. stupid cop-types when the eggs on their face when the villain... is still winning.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you seen the SAW movies? Dude wasn't even PRESENT. Every one of the victims died of something they did. Sure, the Jigsaw Killer set up the situations, but they killed themselves. The ones who survived did shit they'd not have thought possible when they woke up that morning. <br/>\n<br/>\nPhonebooth: One man and a gun and a whole lot of head-trip. This would obviously only work in a game where the killer had a very real ability to snuff the character like that. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere's another movie that I can't recall the name of... Dude sets people up in elaborate contraptions and hooks the contraptions up to a website hit-counter, where the website shows video of the person dying.. The more people that go to the site, the faster the person dies. If no one were to go, the person wouldn't die.. So in a real sense, it is the media and the media-hungry public that kills them. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor philosophical killing patterns, you could use the stigmata.. Dude doesn't kill people at first, he just maims people. As each day passes, the cops find another "stigmatic" until eventually, the final wound, the "spear" thrust ends up with a corpse. Can the good guys stop it in time?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could use the Plagues of Egypt..

That gets especially good when he starts sending models of murders that haven't happened yet, and you have this whole thing of desperately trying to prevent fate .. and of course the model is always right.<br/><br/>I'm running a serial killer based plot in a fantasy game right now, which has a killer attempting to create a perfect body for the demonic creature he believes will inhabit it. His crimes are a combination of careful planning and treatment of the body (washing, cleaning, embalming, dressing) combined with frenzied violence when it fails again (disembowling, mutilation, carving symbols into the flesh and then leaving the bodies where people will stumble on them), and has that classic implied sexual element that really drives the fascination with things like the Ripper murders.<br/><br/>The big advantage of doing this in a fantasy game is that you can compensate for the "kill the suspect" problem by having the killer's spirit jump bodies, or be resurrected, or whatever, as appropriate for your setting. In my plot there have been two killers already, because killing the body is only a stopgap, the only way to really end it is to destroy the demon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178711/#Comment_178711" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-14T11:01:32+00:00" title="November 14, 2008 11:01AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Dude wasn't even PRESENT.</blockquote>\n[nerd]<div class="Spoiler">He was lying on the floor the whole movie in a puddle of blood, in Saw 1.</div>[/nerd]<br/>-----<br/>As for cool killer patterns, you could definitely do something with the Major Arcana of Tarot.

Conversion complete.<br/>Really, I want to play MlwM where the master is a criminal and the minions are cops and detectives. That would be hot.<br/><br/>Wolfe is right. A is your only problem. B and C and godsends.<br/>Seriously, if after a few scenes of probing the players become dismissing of the potential mastermind killer... let them. Let them go on being dismissive. Get more arrogant with your clue dropping and let them realize in horror this ENTIRE THING could have been avoided if only they'd been less cocky when they dismissed Mr. Baldenson.<br/><br/>Okay, Kev, I'll try to be specific and give examples.<br/><br/><b>WAYS IN WHICH YOU AVOID SITUATION A</b><br/><br/>SOCIAL CONTRACT<br/>You can either make it clear at the outset that the arch-villain is physically untouchable or not. Making it clear that part of the campaign's fun will be in contending with this person's personality is a good idea either way.<br/><br/>MECHANICS (that prevent situation A)<br/>Put a big pile of red beads on the table. Say "this is the bad guy's untouchability". Put a tiny pile of black beads on the table. Say "this is how much time you have before another innocent person dies". Have mechanics for the depletion of both piles. When the black beads hit 0, the next victim dies. If the bad guy is tied up or in jail at the time, then he clearly set it all up beforehand. Then put a new tiny pile of black beads on the table, and say "this is how much time you have before another innocent person dies". When the red pile is almost gone, begin making it clear that several people are somehow imprisoned and will die brutally without direct intervention from the killer. Se7en uses this plot twist. In The Cell, the criminal has a woman imprisoned in a tank being slowly filled with water, and no one knows where this tank is being kept. In Saw II, the police don't want to kill Jigsaw because he holds the key to the whereabouts of the factory complex in which people are dying in his traps. The red beads hit 0, and finally the players are mechanically allowed to kill the bad guy... but they DON'T. Innocent lives are at risk, and now is NOT the time to extract vengeance.<br/><br/>SITUATION ENGINEERING<br/>If the PCs are cops, they legally can't kill the bad guy. If they are prosecutors (watch a sample of Law and Order: Criminal Intent episodes) they can't legally kill the bad guy. They need proof. The bad guy is freed to flaunt all they want, because they aren't actually confessing (see Basic Instinct).<br/><br/><br/><b>PLAYING THE BAD GUY</b><br/><br/>For the purposes of this section, "you" will refer to  a mixture of you and the bad guy NPC.<br/><br/>When you are being arrested or cornered, grin like you just gained the upper hand.<br/>When the good guys have you cornered, or in some way think they have you in a nice neat package, have a gruesome off-screen death that you orchestrated remotely.<br/>Refer to one of the cops on a first name basis. Be sexual or overly-friendly or malicious about it.<br/><br/>...damn it, lunch break is up.

Though, given that the serial killer is almost a non-entity in the game (I mean, he only kills people), I don't know if it would really work.<br/><br/>I'll admit that Jonathan Walton's Murderland contest started me down the path of writing a game like this.

Be sexual or overly-friendly or malicious about it. Do not do this with every cop. Personalize your relationship with one of the enemy, keeping the distance with the others. This is a head trip for the one cop, feeds distrust to his/her party members, gives the impression that there is a secret and dark past between you two (which may be substantiated or a red herring).<br/><br/>Show the character's frailty. The killer in Se7en is a weak, balding man who is crippled by his obsession over morality. The killer in Saw is an old man. The killer in Insomnia is a writer who has affairs with younger girls. The killer in Basic Instinct is an author, and despite all her hyper-sexuality is portrayed as being <i>just a woman</i>. The key is that if the killer is a man, he is just a man. If she is a woman, she is just a woman. They are not god-like. They don't just have weaknesses (like a comic book villain), they ARE weak. But amidst their being weak they are also clever, driven and able to see the world in a detached perspective.<br/><br/>They are always proud and vain. Watch Basic Instinct. Watch the scene where the lead girl is being interrogated. She oh-so-intentionally uncrosses her legs and the interrogators all crane their necks to get a better view of her panty-free situation. She's taking time to prove to them that she is that untouchable object of desire. Not just physically, but also in terms of her having all the power in this investigation. She'll show them what she wants to show them, and she'll leave them exasperated because they want the rest. The killer in Se7en is infuriatingly passive and self-assured when he turns himself in mid-scheme. He knows that he has the dominant hand of cards. In Saw II, Jigsaw allows the police to bust into his office with him in it. They draw guns on him. He refuses to speak. In short order they see the series of tv screens showing his victims trapped inside his trap. The police can't kill him. They can't touch him. And so he refuses to speak.<br/><br/>You want to have the good guys go off chasing someone from your past. Let it "slip" that you have a terrible relationship with your mother. Let them "uncover" the mountains of evidence to back this up - counselling records, seven misdemeanors as a young offender, etc. Let them chase down your mother, but make it tricky. She moved a lot in her old age. Have them find her dead, with a taunting note from you dated five months previous. Have them furious that they wasted so much god-damn time on this wild goose chase.<br/><br/>Give the players a very clear moral ultimatum. "Let me go and the girl lives", "You can either save yourself or save the village", etc. Have an "I told you so" speech prepared for either decision that they make. If they choose to let you go and save the girl, laugh at their inability to see the big picture. If they keep you under lock-and-key, laugh at how their vanity as police officers has led them to inhumane decisions. Laugh that they are "as bad as you are".<br/><br/>If they attempt to circumvent the ultimatum and choose hidden option C, allow it, don't try to correct the situation. Then have the bad guy grin and say something coy like "you've learned the first lesson of this game". Then before the players have a chance to comment on how cheesy this is, have something blow up or an officer radio in that they've found another dead body. From that point on make the ultimatums unclear, open-ended and morally grey.<br/><br/>Combine the above suggestion and the first suggestion of this post... Have the ultimatum focused on how to handle the "befriended" officer or character. If the killer has played up being all "buddy-buddy" with Agent Murk, then it only makes sense to later introduce to the good guys an ultimatum: Agent Murk knows who you are (no he doesn't), and he's hiding the information from you. You can either trust him (and not alienate him), or you can trust me (and beat the "answer" out of him). Why would the mastermind killer lie about something like this? Surely it's more likely that the seedy Agent Murk (who hangs around with known mastermind killers!) is the one hiding something. Of course... Agent Murk knows nothing. But who's to say you didn't pull that player aside between sessions and broker some kind of information sharing deal?<br/><br/>Combining the "wild goose chase from the past" and the "buddy up with a good guy" suggestions... Once the good guy has established the name of a character from his past (maybe Mully from his old baseball team...), start dropping exclusive information that only Mully <i>should</i> be able to know. The one detective suddenly goes, "Oh, that's why he's been so friendly with me. He is someone from my past!" And then a wild goose chase ensues trying to track down this guy from one of the detective's year books. This one is hard to coordinate, but it can happen. I think this happens in Fatal Attraction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178748/#Comment_178748" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-14T14:01:08+00:00" title="November 14, 2008  2:01PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2008 5:04PM by Mcdaldno.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Recommended viewing, in priority order:<br/><br/>Basic Instinct<br/>Along Came a Spider<br/>Dexter, Season One<br/>Insomnia<br/>Saw I and II<br/>Fatal Attraction<br/>Law and Order: Criminal Intent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178752/#Comment_178752" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-14T14:16:58+00:00" title="November 14, 2008  2:16PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is beautiful.
