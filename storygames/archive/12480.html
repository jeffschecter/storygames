Two of us have played Archipelago (and Last Train out of Warsaw based on it) before, we've also tried a few games form "Norwegian Style". However, we're still not sure whether we get what Norwegian style actually is. Plus, we've customized a couple of things, rather spontaneously. Anyway, here's what we did.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, an important thing \u2013 I\u2019ve decided to omit the introductory part with clapping hands and making noise. We always play in the same cafe and we don't want to be thrown out of there. After a quick brainstorming we choose not to play in the 1800\u2019s but to choose late 60's in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters we drew:<br/>\n1) American Jew + Soviet spy + old as the Wandering Jew (finally interpreted as the Wandering Jew himself) + women (interpreted as sexual preference not gender, of course) \u2013 vh<br/>\n2) Ethiopian + senator (interpreted not as job but as his nickname in the voodoo cult) + eternally young + frigid \u2013 Juliusz<br/>\n3) Russian + leader of the youth New Age cult + teenager + male \u2013 me (Ina)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Side note:</b> the characters we\u2019ve created were a bit more unconventional than the example with Polish carpenter given in the book. Maybe that\u2019s the reason why our play was concentrated more on the characters and the Society itself, with the mnemosites laid somehow aside, as you will see below.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Pregame (childhood):</i><br/>\nThe Russian:<br/>\nI wanted my character to be brought in the States by parents being dissidents from Soviet Union. The scene was set in a funfair and after short play we reached the climax: the character\u2019s parents were shot during the roller coaster ride.<br/>\nThe Senator:<br/>\nThe middle of war in Ethiopia. Ten years old kid caught by soldiers and mistaken for a partisan is interrogated. He pretends to be courageous claiming he won\u2019t tell anything (actually, there hardly is something he could tell). But finally he repeats what he heard from his parents and gets a cookie. And here\u2019s something supercool I noticed much later: the scene ends like this \u2013 somebody throws _a_cat_ (a dead one?) right in the character\u2019s face.<br/>\nThe Wandering Jew<br/>\nThat was quick but strong. It\u2019s the first year of a new century. The character is 3 years old. Soldiers bend over him and wonder whether to kill him or not. Finally they decide not to do so \u2013 well, they have the order to kill newborns and this kid seems to be somewhat older.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Pregame (youth)</i><br/>\nFor all characters it was the moment of the first contact with mnemosites.<br/>\nThe Senator<br/>\nDuring his long stay in the jungle was bitten by a white crocodile. While recovering he had a vision of big, cat like, yellow eyes gazing at him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Side note:</b> after the session it occurred to me that this first notion about mnemosites strongly influenced our further ideas and from this point we were leaning towards the image of mnemosites as the beasts.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext to facts we\u2019ve discovered in this act: mnemosites groan and you can hear that not only in a dream (discovered when put to jail after driving), they are contagious like a disease (here we had a scene with Jews in the Temple getting infected one by one \u2013 it looks like a kind of trance; I really enjoyed that scene).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Side note:</b> <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12036" rel="nofollow">here</a> in his AP Matthijs concentrated on the pregame when it comes to describing the fiction. That makes me feel that the pregame is particularly important part but I also think that in our case it took just too long.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Exposition</i><br/>\nThe society was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by the Senator. It\u2019s main aim is to protect form the mnemosites.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Side note:</b> the problem with in-character. Juliusz solved it by narrating most of his scenes from the perspective of a survivor who records a video tape (also the foundation of the society scene). Vh\u2019s Jew was really grumpy because grumbling is the only thing vh can do in-character as he claims. Maybe the lack of ritualisation and may out-of-character elements changed our perspective form internal and mental to a more social one.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Exposition and weaving</i><br/>\nHere we had a couple of not really connected scenes. We paid no attention to the chronological order. Meetings of New Age cult, assisting the death of one of the Dreamers, hunting in the realm of dreams and the Society members who try to escape from the danger by committing suicide.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Side note:</b> the problem with dream. We incorporated a dream into a scene not only when the board suggested so. We\u2019ve decided to use a dream in two cases and in two ways:<br/>\n1) when it\u2019s chosen by Ouija \u2013 I think it\u2019s like an exploration scene and the dream is the point of the scene itself; here we use the special rules;<br/>\n2) when it\u2019s not chosen by the board but one of players decides to use a dream as a way to achieve other goal (e.g. hunting scene); here we narrate the scene in a regular way, even if it includes a contact with a Dreamer.<br/>\nIs that kosher?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>One more side note:</b> I feel that our game was nor about mnemosites, neither about the Society and its members. Most of the scenes included only one character (and just one included all three of them). It seems to me that we were concentrated mainly on social aspects of the discoveries of the Society.<br/>\nTo clarify that I have to mention the cut scenes our play was full of. Starting from the second act at least once per scene somebody came up with a cultural allusion or context. Examples: we made a man with a man with an \u2018x\u2019 on his forehead (Charles Manson) and Valerie Solanas members of the Society who assisted the death of a Dreamer. We had also the scene with the Senator talking about his lost journal. The fact connected with mnemosites here was that they reproduce when described and read. And here we just couldn\u2019t resist and had to add some cut scenes: first one with a Norwegian game designer who designs a game that concentrates on generating mnemosites (sorry!) and second one with a French professor of study of religions who lends his students a strange journal and asks them to make copies.<br/>\nThat was super fun but, again, is that kosher?<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Ending</i><br/>\nFinally we ended up with the last meeting of a few members who survived. It\u2019s Russian\u2019s funeral. The Senator and Wandering Jew meet for the last time. They know it wasn\u2019t death by natural causes. They\u2019ve seen a huge hole in Russian\u2019s chest and they know what emerged from it. A strange cat strolling down the pavement. Shot.<br/>\nPlus the epilogue \u2013 the Senator\u2019s last recording, he shoots himself; the Wandering Jew somewhere in Russia, hiding a mysterious board.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>To sum up:</b><br/>\nWe\u2019ve started at 5 p.m., had a 15 minutes break about 8 and finished at 9 p.m. We\u2019ve tried to take our time and not to rush and that was ok. We omitted most of the ritual elements, now I think I regret it because I really liked the fun with oujia (though Juliusz says it\u2019s just a gimmick I feel it has an influence on the pace and character of the game). There should be more in-character play, but the cut scenes were great, however out-of-character, they were worth it. The feeling of danger gave us a bit \u201c44\u201d-like effect. Oh, and one thing we had problem with \u2013 the competences of instructor slightly change form phase to phase and it was sometimes difficult to keep that in mind. But maybe it\u2019s just because it was our first session. Definitely, I want to play one more time and try to do it more \u201cby the book\u201d.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and please forgive me grammar mistakes, if there are any.

I've wanted to play Society of Dreamers in a different setting for a LONG time - in fact, I was thinking about trying the 60's last weekend. Now I want to even more.<br><br>Since you're asking, I'll just say for the record that everything you do with any of my games is kosher as far as I'm concerned. I write the games, I try to say how I and other people have played them successfully, and then people do things I'd never thought of with them, which is fun. There is no RIGHT way. I'll tell you how I get fun and interesting play, though. Feel free to ignore everything I say and do whatever you want with the game.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ina</cite>That makes me feel that the pregame is particularly important part but I also think that in our case it took just too long.</blockquote>\nIt can be pretty long. In my experience, it sometimes takes 2/3 of total playing time, if you go for the most condensed version. It's also very different from the last part - when I play, the last scenes are much more metaphysical, weird, asynchronous, symbolic etc than childhood/youth scenes, which tend to be realistic with weird stuff thrown in.\n<blockquote>Maybe the lack of ritualisation and may out-of-character elements changed our perspective form internal and mental to a more social one.</blockquote>\nThat's very interesting. I'd have liked to be a fly on the wall there. When I play, we're usually out-of-character between scenes, and strongly in-character when playing/acting out the scenes. Multiforming really helps in that respect - when moving about, it's much more natural to stay in character, IMO.\n<blockquote><strong>Side note:</strong>the problem with dream. We incorporated a dream into a scene not only when the board suggested so. We\u2019ve decided to use a dream in two cases and in two ways:<br>1) when it\u2019s chosen by Ouija \u2013 I think it\u2019s like an exploration scene and the dream is the point of the scene itself; here we use the special rules;<br>2) when it\u2019s not chosen by the board but one of players decides to use a dream as a way to achieve other goal (e.g. hunting scene); here we narrate the scene in a regular way, even if it includes a contact with a Dreamer.<br>Is that kosher?</br></br></br></blockquote>\nOh, that's cool. The reason I have Dream as a special scene, is that it's so central to the whole theme of the game; I want the group to really focus on it when someone's going into a Dream. So, I don't think I've seen much narration of dreams in other scenes. How much attention was given to dreams in case 2) - I mean, was it just a sentence or two, or did the narration take over the scene?\n<blockquote>To clarify that I have to mention the cut scenes our play was full of. (...) That was super fun but, again, is that kosher?</blockquote>\nSounds like you had some scenes with no (player) characters in them? That sounds like fun, and might even be part of the game (a separate type of scene for the oujia board) - however, it also sounds like it would definitely prolong the game. The game really needs a bit of constraint to keep it from taking several evenings of play. I'd probably only have very short cut scenes, or include them if I were trying out a mini-campaign.\n<blockquote>We omitted most of the ritual elements, now I think I regret it because I really liked the fun with oujia (though Juliusz says it\u2019s just a gimmick I feel it has an influence on the pace and character of the game).</blockquote>\nI would say you're both right. At the circus, almost everything is a gimmick - the silly hats, the fake accents, the claims that the animals and stunts are dangerous. However, the gimmicks MAKE the circus. They set the mood and expectations. I've tried different ritual elements, and tried without any, and there's a reason I strongly prefer play with the rituals as described. (However, I absolutely understand that playing in public poses certain problems in that respect <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>the competences of instructor slightly change form phase to phase and it was sometimes difficult to keep that in mind.</blockquote>\nThat's just the nature of the beast, I think. Players have different skill sets and strengths. Maybe try to identify what each player is good at, and have them focus on that? For instance, one guy might be "NPC guy" because he's so good at portraying weird characters; another might be "occult theory guy" because he has all that esoteric knowledge. \n<blockquote>Definitely, I want to play one more time and try to do it more \u201cby the book\u201d.</blockquote>\nThis is the biggest compliment I can receive as a designer. Thank you.<br><br>(Oh, one last thing:)\n<blockquote>However, we're still not sure whether we get what Norwegian style actually is.</blockquote>\nYeah, people say that. By definition, "N\xf8rwegian Style" means the games in the book &amp; on the blog, really. So while there are a lot of common elements, there are some games that don't fit in at all. (Zombie Porn, for instance, is pretty different from other freeform/short-form Norwegian games).                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/juliusz" title="juliusz"><img alt="juliusz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/juliusz">juliusz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280720/#Comment_280720" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T15:08:57+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  3:08PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Matthijs,<br><br>Thanks for answers!<br><br>About the whole kosher thing: for me, it boils down to this. Designer knows which way of playing his game is fun, and how the ruleset supports that. First time (of first few times) I play the game, I want to follow the rules as closely as possible, and reconstruct that way of playing. Issue of "the right way" is nothing more than another way of saying that the game is designed to deliver particular experience, and playing by the book allows that. Of course, I have no problems with hijacking the game, but first I'd like to know how exactly it works. I kinda believe in author's intention and all that stuff.<br><br>Some Norwegian Style games (Until We Sink, In the Belly of the Whale) pose some problems here: it seems to me that there is sort of "background knowledge", concerning number of techniques and things to do / to not do while playing these two games, and that "background knowledge" is very important for the experience generated by those games. It seems to me, that quasi-LARP techniques, like gesticulation, or particular approach, like points from "Nordic Dreaming" part of The Society of Dreamers .pdf, are very important here. Multiforming is an excellent example - I can imagine that playing In the Belly of the Whale using multiform is very different from playing it, so to say, tabletop.<br><br>But, that's unnecessary digression. Going into details...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>It can be pretty long. In my experience, it sometimes takes 2/3 of total playing time, if you go for the most condensed version.

Maybe because I was using that video tape thing to narrate event after foundation of the Society, and childhood &amp; youth scenes were played with different narration mode.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>2) when it\u2019s not chosen by the board but one of players decides to use a dream as a way to achieve other goal (e.g. hunting scene); here we narrate the scene in a regular way, even if it includes a contact with a Dreamer.<br>Is that kosher?</br></blockquote>\nOh, that's cool.

How much attention was given to dreams in case 2) - I mean, was it just a sentence or two, or did the narration take over the scene?<br><br>In that case, narration of the dream almost completely took over the scene.<br><br>Funny thing about the Dream sequence: for me, being an Instructor in a Dream sequence felt a little bit like playing a computer game. There's that thing in Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal, when at some level of, if I recall correctly, Watcher's Keep, to complete a quest one plays kind of a game, using only commands like "go west", "drink it", "open the chest", and so on. We played that in very similar way.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>To clarify that I have to mention the cut scenes our play was full of. (...)

I'd probably only have very short cut scenes, or include them if I were trying out a mini-campaign.<br><br>Yup, there were no player character in those scenes.They were really short, mostly consisting of just two or three sentences. I think there were about 10 or 12 of them. An example, after playing third and last video tape of Senator: "1975, Wichita Falls. The young guy turns TV off and takes the tape out of video recorder. 2009. The same guy, but way older, skyscraper behind him, his hands cuffed. Police around him, journalists everywhere, asking: "Mr Madoff, your fraud...", "Mr Madoff, what about investors...". His catlike walk."<br>The effect was somewhat similar to that part of "The Watchmen" (comic book, not the movie), when Dr. Manhattan, at the surface of Mars, has reminiscences of various events from his life. I enjoyed that technique, making Bush senior or Genesis P-Orridge influenced by Society was really fun.<br><br>I'd like to play the game again, too, with all the rituals and stuff. The Nordic Dreaming approach looks interesting: I think that we used points 4, 5, 6, at least partially 7, 8 and 9. Using all of them would change a lot, as would using the first person narration + multiforming. But it's very far from my usual style of playing (to use the Forge term, I'm used to Director Stance and third person narration), and switching from that mode isn't easy ;-)<br><br>Juliusz                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
