Views and click-throughs slowly earn revenue, at no cost to the user. I *might* offer a subscription model that gets rid of the ads and allows for larger character rosters for a particular game, but that's still open for debate (and mainly will be a factor of my server bandwidth usage and costs).<br><br>Other than that, I plan to do the supplement thing, with a sort of progression:<br/>* shotGLASS - free, barebones rules, few or no examples, mainly for reference, though someone could build a whole game with it with some effort (and/or experience with HERO System).<br/>* GLASS - soft or hard cover digest book with all rules, multiple examples, some art, and a number of popular, ready-to-run genre write-ups.<br/>* Supplements - soft or hard cover digest books with highly detailed settings, Templates, and Packages for the setting genre, along with archetypal characters, major NPCs, and common adversaries.<br/><br/>I will also look into various accessories, but LARP has very few necessary accessories that are "brandable." The main thing I've thought of is a stand-alone application that runs the GLASS database and synchs with the online one, so that folks can use netbooks or laptops on-site, then update their "main page" on the GLASScutters site. As a bonus, because it's most useful through the web interface (e.g. assigning Exp to characters so that they can spend it), and because I can use product keys to authenticate the app (i.e. a copy can't be used online), I can hopefully get a small revenue stream going from those CD sales.<br/><br/>Beyond that obvious accessory/playing aid, I can't really think of anything else to provide revenue, without actually going into a different "line of work" (e.g. I could sell boffers... but why, when there's a ton of folks already doing it and who might pay me to advertise on my database site?). MAYBE sell some kind of "Official Experience Tokens" as a sort of novelty item--in tenths, halves, and full Exp units!--though folks can (obviously) use anything they want that's not too tough to forge (e.g. cheap custom poker chips).                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aeonite" title="aeonite"><img alt="aeonite" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/sg/myicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aeonite">aeonite</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222722/#Comment_222722" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T10:35:43+00:00" title="August  5, 2009 10:35AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of having one core Player's Handbook, have three or four spread out over a couple years.<br/><br/>Same with Game Master's Guides.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222734/#Comment_222734" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-05T11:13:12+00:00" title="August  5, 2009 11:13AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I would set up a business where I went around and licensed the publication rights from indie game designers with really hot games who were nearing completion, like an indie record label or something.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nWhile there are some militantly indie types who would be opposed on a fundamental level to this...I've been waiting to see someone step up and do this for awhile.

But a lot of those things run up against the traditional culture of story games.  I used to joke that we would know that Vincent Baker had sold out when he released the "Back East" sourcebook for Dogs in the Vineyard, with rules for playing Pinkertons.

I know a LOT of WOD players who saw the DragonCon announcement of the NWOD and walked out saying, "Oh, well, that's it for me and White Wolf, then." And I thought, as they said such things, "Yeah, but, man, you've already bought every supplement--you were mostly done anyway!"<br/><br/>I guess some folks would buy supplements in OWOD indefinitely, but the idea of revamping (heh) the rules AND rebooting the metaplot was... abhorrent. But I'd be inclined to ask what NWOD brings that makes it *a different game entirely* and if that's a game I'd (we'd) want to play?

And essentially nothing reasonable can't be replicated by someone dedicated to the idea.  But, some first thoughts:<br/><br/>If you're printing in color, you can print using inks that won't replicate properly on normal copy machines and laser printers.  There must be some clever way to use that advantageously.<br/><br/>You could require shining a light through a page and having things lined up precisely to form a whole image (assuming your printer can maintain QC).  I'm not sure if this would actually work, but it's something to check out.<br/><br/>Give each product a serial number and make part of the game sending in the sheet for some online segment of play -- advancement perhaps.  That seems pretty solid.  Destruction isn't really needed, but each product gets used (if used fully) only once.  <br/><br/>I don't really have any great ideas for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222957/#Comment_222957" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-06T08:56:49+00:00" title="August  6, 2009  8:56AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Leverage user-generated content into something that users end up paying money for.
