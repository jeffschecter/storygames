                    Hey.  I've decided to bite the bullet, and have started a new podcast called "The Butcher Block":<br/><br/><a href="http://butcherblock.libsyn.org/" rel="nofollow">http://butcherblock.libsyn.org/</a><br/><br/>... it's going to be a show all about things Jim Butcher, as well as things Jim's fans might find cool.  Since I'm one of the authors working on the Dresden Files RPG, you can expect some RPG tidbits will get spilled there in the coming months, as well as chat about the upcoming Dresden Files TV series on the Sci Fi channel.  <br/><br/>This first episode runs just six minutes long.  Subscribe and give it a listen!<br/><br/>So, while this isn't a pure-gaming podcast, I'm the guy running his yap, so you can expect that I'll be using it to talk about gaming occasionally.  *That* said, I know a number of you do the podcast thing, and I'd be happy to run short ads for your shows, as well as get bumpers from you guys, saying something clever like, "This is Judd from the Sons of Kryos, and you're chopping away at the Butcher Block" or whatever. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>
