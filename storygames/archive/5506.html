A guy who calls himself "Ryukishi07" created a series of visual novel games called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higurashi_no_naku_koro_ni" rel="nofollow">Higurashi no Naku Koro ni</a> (something like "When the Cicadas Cry"). He did the illustrations and scripts himself, and the programming, merchandising, etc. are mostly handled by other members of his family. It has since been adapted into numerous other media, including an anime series (which I finished watching the other day) and an upcoming live-action movie. Geneon was releasing the anime in the US, but in September they announced that they Geneon USA would be shutting down completely, so fansubs are all that's left.<br/><br/>The story concerns the small town of Hinamizawa, where a group of young people find themselves caught up in the unfolding mystery of the series of murders that have occurred on the night of the town's Watanagashi festival every year for the past few years.<br/><br/>(A little space, because I can't explain things without spoilers).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So, if you sit down and watch the anime, episode 4 (of 26) ends with the main protagonist taking his own life. In episode 5, things start over more or less normally, and only the new chapter heading lets you know that something has changed on purpose. The series progresses through several alternate timelines and retellings, and along the way more and more of Hinamizawa's secrets are revealed. Around the end of the first season Keiichi actually remembers a piece of one of the previous alternate worlds. At the opening of the second season, we find out why tiny little Rika sometimes reveals another darker, more mature persona: she remembers each world clearly, and has lived over a hundred years, trapped in June 1983. By remembering enough from one world to the next, she is able to retain the truth, and only by bringing all of her friends together can she hope to overcome Fate, save Hinamizawa, and at last see July and beyond.<br/><br/>I mean, <i>damn</i>. A complex murder mystery, which the characters experience in the form of a series of alternate worlds, and rampant paranoia drives people to do the most desperate, insane things. There's a hell of a game in there.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123547/#Comment_123547" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T17:51:22+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  5:51PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes. This one's one of my absolute favorite anime shows, period. If you haven't seen it yet, find the second season as soon as possible.<br/><br/>My recommendations for system hacks: DRYH, Sorcerer, any other game designed to drive characters to breaking points, or IAWA for the episodic content.<br/><br/>My lead recommendation is Sorcerer, but consider that technically speaking, everyone's demon would be the same thing.<br/><br/>And if you do this hack and don't tell me, I will cotton drift you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
