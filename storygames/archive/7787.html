Do you just say "and he yells..." and carry on in a normal conversation volume?<br/>Do you have a "yelling tone" that you adopt?<br/><br/>If a passerby observed you for just that period where you were roleplaying an angry character, would they think that YOU were angry yourself?<br/><br/>Do you play an angry character differently at a con compared to with a closely-knit group? (and is that about respecting boundaries or shyness?)<br/><br/>How believable are you when you roleplay an angry person? What makes you believable? Does believability matter?<br/><br/>How do you react when other players get all loud and roleplay an angry character REALLY intensely?<br/><br/><br/><b>Please don't give me line-for-line responses</b>.

Although I think that would be a stretch on their part, since I usually try and make sure to show that I'm angry as my character, not as me, George.

At times, I think people have confused my character's emotion for my emotion, but I usually do this in games where immersion is encouraged. If it's a game with more author and director stance, I usually describe that he goes ballistic and then mimic the way you're speaking when you're yelling, but don't raise my voice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172735/#Comment_172735" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T00:14:51+00:00" title="October  3, 2008 12:14AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the other gamers really know me, they've seen rage and yelling (though only concerning insane drivers and liberals).<br/><br/>I would describe - but with intensity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172740/#Comment_172740" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T02:07:04+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  2:07AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends.  (Like there's any other possible answer for questions like these.)<br/><br/>I hardly ever yell for real.  I might get a bit louder, or make angry-looking gestures, or speak with more intensity, or explicitly say "I'm furious about this, and so I start yelling...", or describe my character's appearance/demeanor (angry expression, flushed, etc.).  Sometimes I might just say something like "I spend the next five minutes angrily cursing the district attorney and using every swear word in every language I know" and move on.  Many times I will make out-of-character remarks at some point to make it clear that whatever anger might be showing in my performance is completely fake.<br/><br/>Because the most important point for me is that <i>the character</i> is angry:  it has literally nothing whatsoever to do with <i>me</i>, the guy sitting at the table with his friends playing the game, being angry.  So I do enough to demonstrate that the character's pissed off, without letting it touch my actual emotional state.  I'm not in this hobby to get some kind of catharsis: I have plenty of things in my real life worth being angry or sad about during the week, I'm not so starved for emotional expression that I need to work it into my leisure time as well.<br/><br/><br/>As far as how I feel when other people "play angry," it's not something I worry about much these days, since I've been playing exclusively with a group of close friends for several years now; I know that none of them are the type who get genuinely angry during a game, so I know that any signs of anger I might see are only in-character.  Not that any of them do anything much different from what I do; we're all pretty laid back in that respect.  If we added a new guy who was playing anger to the hilt, it would probably bother me until/unless he demonstrated that it was just acting...and he'd probably be getting the "Seriously, WTF is wrong with you?" look from the rest of us until he dialed it back.  We know what angry people look like (most of us see too many of them too often), so we don't put a high value on someone being able to act it out for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172741/#Comment_172741" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T02:47:52+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  2:47AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would <i>love</i> to be able to yell for real whenever I felt like it.

Any tight-knit group I play with is liable to play in someones home (which usually  means an apartment/a flat)... Instead I go for gestures, talking thorugh maybe and of course using facial expression (eyebrows are really handy, huh?).<br/><br/>As Anna notes above, being sudden can make a huge impact. We're mostly used to going about our hobby in a very civil way no matter what goes on in the fiction, so raising your voice, standing up, storming of or maybe just grabbing the nearest piece of scrap paper and tearing it can be a really big thing and a very clear signal. Of course, if everyone just think you're freaking out things might get weird but... let's have confidence in our comrades, eh?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan" title="MountZionRyan"><img alt="MountZionRyan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/426/nG1TIXTID71FS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan">MountZionRyan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172758/#Comment_172758" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T06:05:11+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  6:05AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By raging and yelling.

Here's the interesting thing:<br/><br/>The way he let us know it was the character, and not himself, is that he would have the character screw up, stumble over words, make mistakes, etc, and generally kind of make fun of himself in subtle sort of way. It was effective without being too comical. <br/><br/>Come to think of it, I do that too, but I have to do it narratively, because I don't have his skills:<br/><br/>If I'm playing a character who is really pissed off, I might say one or two angry words to express the anger, without going overboard, but afterwards (or in the middle) narrate in some little detail that shows I'm not necessaily siding with the character. For example, I might say, "...and, as he gestures, his arm flies out and knocks over his drink by mistake.

We came upon a witch. For reasons I can't remember, we wanted to kill this witch. However, she told us the person who killed her would be cursed. Another player, who was playing a noble and was essentially "my boss," promised me a potion to get rid of the curse, which he had come across earlier. So, I killed her. He declined to give me the potion. My character got pissed and I started almost-yelling, and calling him a son-of-a-bitch and things like that. I was later told by the GM that I "needed to calm down" that it was "just a game." We'd just picked up a couple new players, and I guess they were a little uncomfortable as well.<br/><br/>I found that kind of interesting, as it made perfect sense for my character, who was now walking around with a curse, to be really, really pissed. Sure, real-life me was irritated as well, but not yelling and cursing irritated. That was the character. <br/><br/>I'd like to be able to do that more in my regular game, but I find it kind of difficult to keep track of so many things (as the GM) that the idea of adding the NPC's emotions as well is a little intimidating. Mostly I just describe an NPC as "being angry" and talk with a pissed off tone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173399/#Comment_173399" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T22:21:31+00:00" title="October  5, 2008 10:21PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            New question:<br/><br/>What games handle/encompass/allow scenes of intense emotion, particularly rage or anger?<br/>What parts of their system (in the narrowest or broadest sense) aid in this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173403/#Comment_173403" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T22:56:31+00:00" title="October  5, 2008 10:56PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2008 10:57PM by kevperrine.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted my thoughts to this in another thread - as I thought it could be a seperate topic.<br/>Fun fun fun!<br/><br/>please read/reply <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7827&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">HERE</a><br/><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173405/#Comment_173405" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T23:02:37+00:00" title="October  5, 2008 11:02PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2008 11:03PM by kevperrine.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>New question:<br/><br/>What games handle/encompass/allow scenes of intense emotion, particularly rage or anger?<br/>What parts of their system (in the narrowest or broadest sense) aid in this?</blockquote>\nI'm confused...<br/>Seriously.  <br/>Any activity that includes role-playing as an aspect of the game (or activity) can (and you could say SHOULD) be elevated to be more active in the "intense" emotions  or  rather the role-played illustration of that emotion.<br/><br/>I'd ask in retort...
