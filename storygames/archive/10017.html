The people in my pocket, as I've noted elsewhere, normally organize in bands. But just in the last few days, I've noticed that they have begun to federate along larger clan lines, to protect their traditional lint foraging grounds from alien groups. I figured you had seen some critical breakthrough in marsupioethology in your own studies \u2014 maybe a tiny conquering clan using force to put captives to work scraping virgin liner fabric areas for lint, pointing toward an expanding division of pocket labor?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222372/#Comment_222372" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T07:22:25+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  7:22AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played this several times about a year ago.  I'm glad I did, but I decided it was too little fun for too much time.  But I subscribed to the game's page on BoardGameGeek and have noted over that time that a bunch of development has continued on it.  I'd be interested to hear how it is if anyone plays it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
