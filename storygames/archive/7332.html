Depends on your group, probably.  If they like sharing the jobs you have listed under "Moderating the game or What the GM Does," then they might as well absorb them.  If they don't like sharing those jobs, then the game will fail badly when you try to force them to do so.  So decide who you want this game to appeal to, I guess.<br/><br/><br/>My group, for example, would most likely enjoy your game when it was run by a good GM (it hits near a genre we've played a good game in before), but would absolutely fucking despise the game in every possible way if the GM authority was distributed.  They loathe playing their own antagonists, hate being the primary antagonists for each other, strongly dislike settings which are generated scene-by-scene, mildly dislike having absolute authority over the results of their own characters' actions...basically, they like to have a separate, highly-involved, highly-invested GM playing the "world" -- providing the adversity, judging conflicts, declaring results, etc. -- while they concentrate on playing their own characters.  (And since this is the internet, I should also point out that our group's games are frequently face-meltingly awesome, so I do not in fact consider this situation to be a problem at all.  They're just gaming preferences, nothing more; some folks like sharing GM duties and some don't, and liking your gaming one way does not make you better or worse than people who like it the other way.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162888/#Comment_162888" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-17T00:43:21+00:00" title="August 17, 2008 12:43AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2008 12:47AM by Callan_S.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, now you've realised there's a choice with it - what appeals to you?

You're right I need to decide.  I'm pretty sure I'm going without a GM if I can figure out how to set the scene and antagonist(s) well and working.  The idea hadn't even occurred to me, being from traditional gaming background until last year, that I could do this w/o a GM.  Jason was looking at an earlier draft and asked why I even had one.  Then listening to Rob Bohl on Independent Insurgence talk about Misspent Youth got me to thinking that I could do this w/o a GM and it would still work.  Maybe even better.  I need to do some more research on this and maybe playtest both ways to see which I like best.  Any suggestions of good GM-less games other than Grey Ranks and Misspent?<br/>\nAnd you last statement is spot on.  That is why I posted this question.<br/>\nIt's a good game but any other suggestions on the game would be great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162900/#Comment_162900" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-17T06:09:45+00:00" title="August 17, 2008  6:09AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geiger Counter is GM-less and available for free <a href="http://bleedingplay.wordpress.com/geiger/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_162907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162907/#Comment_162907" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-17T10:07:33+00:00" title="August 17, 2008 10:07AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnathan,<br/>\nThanks.  When you mentioned GC I remembered reading it just this Friday.  What a sweet game!  It was part of the impetus to post the question.  I WILL run GC at some point.  It is a very well put together game and I look forward to it.  I'm going back to it today and see if there is anything that will assist me on the second read.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI posted this over at the Forge too and have gotten some good feedback.  EDEDED recognized one of the potential issues that I have seen - aimlessness w/o a driving force or 'director'.  He noted that the game is an us vs. them game (of course)  and he thought needed someone tasked with keeping things flowing.  A good point.  It made me realize that there are things in my head that haven't made it to paper yet.  Like, if GMless, each player would take a turn being the antagonist(s)/GM.  So I'm seeing it as a hybrid game.  I like the group character/scenario creation a lot.  I need to expand it some for scenario creation.  But I recognize that a GM will focus the characters and players and may provide a driver to some extent.  He also had another suggestion that may get incorporated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162909/#Comment_162909" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-17T10:14:57+00:00" title="August 17, 2008 10:14AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tomg</cite>Any suggestions of good GM-less games other than Grey Ranks and Misspent?</blockquote>\n<i>Polaris, Shock:, Contenders, The Roach, Dirty Secrets</i><br/>mmm... those are the ones I have that immediately leap to mind.

That, and <i>Capes</i>, which for my money is the king of GMless games.<br/><br/>Tom, the key to GMless design is to make sure the tasks that a GM usually does in games are apportioned around the group in a way that's fun and engaging. Shock: for instance has the player to your Left control the forces of Antagonism for your Protagonist. That player does GM-y stuff like designing and roleplaying characters that oppose or complicate your Protag's life, while other GMy stuff such as various facets of worldbuilding are distributed differently, so yet a third player may be involved in a scene if he's in charge of say, Religion and needs to contribute some relevant details.<br/><br/>Whereas in Capes it's a bit more free-for-all, with everyone swapping around the roles of Hero, Villain and Supporting Cast from scene to scene. The key cycle of play revolves around creating conflicts that engage other players toward vigorous opposition, then either winning and getting your goal or losing and reaping "cool opposition" rewards. . .which you can use to handily win further conflicts.<br/><br/>The important thing to remember is to NOT gut the cool things in GMing out of your game, but rather divide them up in ways that are <i>most fun</i> for <i>this</i> game.<br/><br/>To that end, I'm compelled to point out that out of Accounting for Taste's list of detractors:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>loathe playing their own antagonists</blockquote>\nand\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>mildly dislike having absolute authority over the results of their own characters' actions</blockquote>\nHave <i>nothing</i> to do with strong GMless design. Granted, this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>hate being the primary antagonists for each other</blockquote>\nmeans that GMless games are still a bad fit for your (AfT's, that is) group, but in wider application, it's important to get clear that providing one's own antagonism is pretty much a drag in any game situation. There are superficial difficulties such as the awkwardness of talking to yourself, but also the deeper issue of lacking a fit resistance to strive against, which is usually provided by the GM, and can be provided by other players. I know of <i>no</i> GMless design that doesn't address this issue, and address it handily. At no time in a game of Shock: or Capes will any player be found describing their character's actions toward a goal AND the opposition to those actions. In the latter case your action may go unopposed, but that's just a sign that no-one else at the table was sufficiently interested in that goal, so you shrug and create a new goal.<br/><br/>Contrast all this to the game of PTA that I tried to play GMless. It was my first Indie game and it looked super-fun and I got greedy--dammit, I wanna play a protagonist too! SO we tried that and ended up quite often resolving the outcomes of our own goals and actions, with no opposition to speak of--and it was suck. And lo and behold, PTA's rules DO provide for a GM precisely to perform that opposition role. Go figure. :P<br/><br/>Hope this helps you decide Tom, and how to proceed whatever you decide.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162922/#Comment_162922" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-17T15:01:54+00:00" title="August 17, 2008  3:01PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey folks,<br/>\nThanks for the feedback.  It seems that the hybrid idea - group world building and a gameplay GM/antagonist is where I'm headed.  Looking back at the initial design ideas I think that is what I had in mind.  I just didn't know how to express it.  The game sprang forth from Sight and Sound Challenge and my first reading of DRYH.  I don't want a player opposing himself at any point.

That design method pivots upon a culture where people not only accept things will be made which aren't entirely compatable with them, but actually like trying games/things that aren't perfectly compatable with them. Whether that culture exists around your area, who can say, but the other option <i>seems </i>to be to try and fit RP cultures expectations, or your groups expectations. Intellectually and creatively that'd get rather incestuous, so I think it's worth considering a 'warts and all' method.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_162934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/162934/#Comment_162934" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-17T19:17:13+00:00" title="August 17, 2008  7:17PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan,<br/>\nIf I understand correctly you are saying 'make your own game' or 'make the game you want to play'.

Or just take the parts of your game that they like and bring 'em over to a system that doesn't have the awful design decisions that they abhor so much.<br/><br/>It's rare that I find myself agreeing with Callan about something, but I'm totally with him when it comes to "you might as well design the game the way you personally want to."  I can only console myself with the knowledge that I'm there because it goes hand in hand with the philosophy that gaming groups should tear, fold, spindle and mutilate any game they intend to play until it provides the experience they want and not worry overmuch about what the designer may or may not have intended, and I'm pretty sure that's not where he's coming from.  But it's a valid conclusion, even if we got there by different routes.
