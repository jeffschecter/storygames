                    I was recently talking with a friend about different games, resolution systems, and the unexpected moments in real life (as opposed to the fiction I almost always concentrate on in RPG discussions) and how they help, hinder, or change the experience of play and what you can and cannot author as a player. <br/><br/>Part of the discussion ended up focusing on how resolutions systems based on character abilities can end up putting GMs into real binds when the type of action being taken is clearly not something the system supports. We came up with an example and argued it back and forth, coming to no final conclusions. So, I thought I'd take this one to the forum to celebrate my return to Toronto. <br/><br/>I'm now going to give you an example of something that happened, and I'd like you to tell me how you would resolve it if you were the GM (or opposition/narrating/guiding player) in a game using a couple of your favorite systems. <br/><br/>The game is a story of political revolution, of a country with a history of brutal human rights abuse on the eve of a possible cultural revolution lead by students, philosophers, and unions. The powerful regime has sent in the military to end protests and public gatherings, authorizing use of lethal force. Tanks are rolling down the street on the well to quell the movement, and by the end of the day thousands of people will be dead. <br/><br/>Then one player announces "I step out into the street, still holding my groceries in my hand. I walk into the path of the tanks and raise my hand for them to stop. If they try to go around me I step into the way, but I offer no other resistance. They will either stop or they will have to run me over where I stand. I face the world with courage and compassion, and hope that it is the sort of place that can face me back with honesty." <br/><br/>What do you have the player do in order to meet her intent? <br/><br/>(And yes, it'll be obvious where this example comes from. And yes, if it is part of your normal system of resolution you can reference the real world outcome of the above action - but it isn't neccisary. We all know that it could have turned out differently.)                </div>

                            Brand,<br/><br/>This is an interesting question, and I can see the edges of the problem here (I think).  In any game I played I wouldn't care about whether or not the character can stand in front of the tank.  Most systems could handle it with an Athletics roll (or similar), but that's a pretty lame contest.  As I see it, the conflict is only interesting at two levels: 1) does the tank stop?, and 2) does it matter?<br/><br/>So looking at my stand-by system of <i>HeroQuest</i>, I'd be rolling one of two contests (or perhaps both, with one being a follow-up).<br/><br/>1.  Does the tank stop?  It'd be a psychological battle.  I'd be rolling in stuff like, 'Civic responsibility', 'Violence solves nothing', 'Passive resistance', 'Looks like your favorite uncle' (who wants to run over their favorite uncle?), and so on.  This works because I play HQ a la Mike Holmes.  So I sort of ignore in-world justifications.  If I lose the contest we figure out why after the roll (guided by traits in play).  Same thing if I win.  Usually it's pretty obvious how the victory or loss will go, but it doesn't have to be.<br/><br/>2.  Does it matter?  This is where the real meat of it is for me.  I'd probably be rolling pretty much the same abilities as above, but with a different eye on winning/losing narration.  Maybe you stop the tank but it doesn't matter because no one sees the dramatic gesture and other tanks go around you and kill everyone.  Maybe you're run dramatically over and no one sees you, or maybe someone snaps a picture of your courageous stand.  Maybe you stop that one tank, and so save a dozen lives that otherwise would have been lost in the slaughter that follows.<br/><br/>I think HQ does this well because it's not worried about the mechanics of how you get from point A to point B.  You start at A, you get some idea of where you're going, you roll some dice to narrow down B, and then you narrate your way to it.  In a more 'traditional' game the abilities you use to roll dice are supposed to act fairly rigidly on the path from A to B, so if you don't have an ability for it it becomes unclear how you can create a path.<br/><br/>I'm sure you already knew all this, but I wanted to talk myself through it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            In <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/suffadv/" rel="nofollow">Sufficiently Advanced</a>, you could do it two ways.<br/><br/>One, using the more "standard" game mechanics, has you starting a Metatech contest with the guy in the tank. Metatech is the game's social stat. You add in a bonus for your Core Value of Peace (or perhaps Life or Nonviolence), and another circumstance bonus for your audacious surprise action. The guy in the tank uses his Metatech to resist, but you roll high enough to blow him away and zero out his Reserve. He bows to your will, at least temporarily, and stops.<br/><br/>The other way uses your Plot Scores, which measure how important you are to the story. You spend your Plot Point for the game through whichever Score is most appropriate. Perhaps Plot Immunity to avoid dying, perhaps Empathy to connect with the guys in the tanks, perhaps Magnetism to sway them to your side. (It seems likely that this guy didn't have a Plot Point, and had to take a Complication to get one... which might explain why no one's seen him since. Perhaps his Complication was "thrown in Chinese prison.")                        </div>

                            I'll tackle it from a d20/D&amp;D perspective,since that's the game system I'm most familiar with.<br/><br/>I'd break it down into a couple parts.  The first part is a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/bluff.htm" rel="nofollow">Bluff</a> check.  Yeah, I know the player isn't bluffing <i>per se</i>, in that he really is going to keep standing there and get squooshed, if it comes to that.  But the tank driver doesn't.  Usually Bluff is opposed by Sense Motive, because usually you're trying to fool someone.  In this case, I'd sorta reverse it -- the player wants the driver to have a good Sense Motive ability and to roll really well, so that he senses what this guy's motives really are.<br/><br/>The basic issue being resolved at this stage is:  Does that tank driver believe you're just going to stand there and let yourself get run over?  Some of the standard modifiers that could potentially apply:<br/><br/>* The target wants to believe you.  (Makes task easier.)  Is the driver morally-against this whole thing, and is looking for a way out?  Or does he really hate these people, whom he blames for killing his whole family, and so is itching for the chance to run them over? <br/><br/>* The bluff is believable and doesn't affect the target much.  (default)  <br/><br/>* The bluff is a little hard to believe or puts the target at some risk.  (Makes task more difficult.)  If the tank driver knows he could get demoted or thrown in jail for stopping, I might go with this.<br/><br/>* The bluff is hard to believe or puts the target at significant risk.  (Makes task much more difficult.)  If there's a morale officer inside the tank with a pistol pointed at the driver's head, I might use this one.<br/><br/>* The bluff is way out there, almost too incredible to consider.  (The task is really tricky now.)<br/><br/>I might be inclined to cut the player a break here, all other things being equal, unless there's some good pre-existing factors in the SIS that would lead me towards one direction or the other.  I probably wouldn't use a randomizer here, but that's a personal thing.<br/><br/>So... either the bluff works, or it doesn't.  If it doesn't, the driver just doesn't believe the PC is going to hold his ground.  Hand the player a new character sheet.<br/><br/>If the bluff works, the driver figures this guy might just be crazy enough to just stand there.  So what does the driver do about it?<br/><br/>This is the second part of the resolution, for which I'd use one or more <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/diplomacy.htm" rel="nofollow">Diplomacy</a> checks.  The first step here is to figure out the driver's current attitude.  By default it would be Indifferent, which implies he would undertake "Socially expected interaction".  Again, there's some need here to know the SIS and whether the driver feels the expectation to stop, or to run him down.<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, I'd probably go with him being Indifferent and inclined to stop, but only to think things over.  So, in a minute, another Diplomacy check.  If the driver's attitude changes for the worse (either by PC action, or the tank commander screaming at him, or whatnot), then it's new character sheet time again.  If the driver's attitude changes for the better (either by PC action, or a crowd of people rallying behind him, or whatnot) then he puts the tank into park and they all get to think it over for a while.  If there's still no change... hmmm.  I'd probably increase the difficulty by, say, 1 per minute, just to reflect the increasing psychological pressure on this guy.<br/><br/>Some folks might make the player make some sort of roll, representing bravery or resistance to fear or whatever, to get that PC to actually go out there and risk his neck.  I'm not really inclined to do that, but the ruleset would support it in a general way, I'd say.  Also, some folks might be inclined to weasel the PC out of his glorious death via various mechanisms.  Not me.  If a player says "They will either stop or they will have to run me over where I stand", that's good enough for me.<br/><br/>Now, I might just be reading something into this scenario, but it seems like the bigger conflict resolution here might have something to do with the issue of whether the military as a whole restrains itself from mowing down a whole lot of civilians.  That would be trickier to model.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>

                            I think we've got enough examples of functional solutions now...I have to say that I don't even see the "edges" of the problem here as Thomas does. Brand, is there a problem? If so, what is it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Thomas, you malign me. I prefer to think that the resolution I do does, in fact, have to do with the in-game events and such - it's just that I have a vivid imagination about what can effect what (not affect).<br/>

                            Mike, <br><br>A host of small things, none of which are easily summed up while I'm suffering jet lag. I'll wait a day to rest and see what other responses come in, and then I'll do some talking about why none of the proposed solutions excite me. <br><br>Some of them (HQ, 9W, CoC) make me content, but not actually happy*. Some of them are obviously just not going to work. And there is an issue in there that my sleep-deprived mind is trying to get at and not yet quite reaching.<br><br/>*Not always at fault of the system either.

                            City of Birds offers two methods, largely up to the player.<br/><br/>Method I:<br/><br/>The Bird says, "I want to stand in front of the tank." His <em>goal</em> is thus to stand in front of the tank, making it an internal conflict. He talks about his confidence, hope for the future, etc. The Snake gets to say whether he stands or not. Let's presume he says yes. The Tiger then gets say on the ramifications of that act. It would be up to him whether the tank stopped or not.<br/><br/>Method II:<br/><br/>What if the player doesn't want his standing to be in doubt? He wants to stand, period. In this case, his intention is clear, but not whether he gets what he wants. The Snake could say something like, "Your buddy leaps out and pulls you to the side," or, "Sure. You do," again passing the final decision to the Tiger. The Snake would also be within his rights — and I think this is the preferable choice — to bite off a bit more and actually decide whether the tank stops or not. Then the Tiger says what that means: maybe, "You die but it provokes a thousand more students to riot." Or "You wake up in the hospital with no legs."                        </div>

<p>The video is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>Like, this guy was coming home from getting groceries, and he saw this atrocity happening in front of him. He probably knew that it was brewing for a month, but today he was just buying vegetables. And he just goes out and stands there, and the driver of the tank just can't do it. He's facing down a tank, but the tank driver is facing a burning mirror.</p>

For slightly different reasons, sure, but....<br/><br/>I'll also say, despite the fact it doesn't fit in with the promised plan of action I gave Mike above, that its also interesting to see how people do or do not use the part of the intent that I found most important to the player statement: "I face the world with courage and compassion, and hope that it is the sort of place that can face me back with honesty."                        </div>

They don't? Mine left it open, saying only that the image became an icon. Which is exactly what happened. No one knows who this man was, despite journalists attempts to find him. There are suspects, but no positive ID as far as I know. He was not killed, as I understand it. The tanks did indeed contribute to the failure of the protests. The picture did indeed contribute to the rest of the world, including a 14-year-old kid in Iowa, give a damn about politics and media.                        </div>

                            In Revolutions, standing in front of the tank means you've largely resolved things. You are coming home with your groceries and see the agents of the old revolution (the tanks). Now, you want to do something, so you declare you will interpose yourself and stop them.<br/>
<br/>
There are several outcomes -  <br/>
<br/>
You fail your unrest - you move to help, but you can't bring yourself to take sides.<br/>
<br/>
You succeed your hurdle, but fail your roll - you arrive too late.<br/>
<br/>
You succeed your roll, and beat the hurdle - move in front of the tanks, they stop.<br/>
<br/>
You succeed your roll, but fail to beat the hurdle - you move in front of the tanks, but they do not stop.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, the next scene is when your family learns what has happened.<br/>

                            Ben's right on the failed revolution point, despite the fact that 1989 did see successful revolutions, on this same model, all across Eastern Europe. Brand's mention of "unions" reminded me a lot more of Solidarity than Tian'anmen.<br/><br/>Also, there are wide reports that the PLA troops from Beijing were sympathetic to the protesters, so the army was forced to bring in troops from the outer provinces in order to clear the square. So there was, to a certain extent, a victory for non-violence.                        </div>

Oh, and using the Hero Quest rules, if the goal is to change the world, then the mechanics to use are, of course, the heroquesting mechanics. That dude, in the picture above, is in the throws of a heroquest. Quite literally.<br/>

                            I have been mulling this over for a while now, and it is a tough question.  The thing that is so striking about the events surounding Tank Man is...well, the incredible intimacy of the moment--it's two men, tank man and tank driver, standing before each other.  We know so little about it--only that he stood in front of the tanks and refused to yield, and the tanks did.  <br/><br/>A lot of resolution mechanics, on the other hand, gets on the table when we know the why and wherefore.  We see this in the examples--is he trying to stop a tank, fuel a revolution, embarass a nation?  As soon as we do that, I feel like we are missing something.  This is a guy walking in front of a tank, carrying with him what can only be terribly personal, human hopes and fears.  Is there any real hope of a resolution when that man did that?<br/><br/>Let me take the D&amp;D example again.  I would leave it as straight Diplomacy, if we *wanted* to take it to that level, but let's imagine something different.<br/><br/>DM (setting color, tone): You are returnign home from the grocery store, see the tanks rolling down the street, knowing in your heart where they are headed, knowing the danger...<br/><br/>Player (interrupting): I step in front of the column of tanks.<br/><br/>DM: What?  It's a tank, you've got groceries...<br/><br/>Player: I step in front of the column.<br/><br/>DM: ok, it starts to turn to go around you...<br/><br/>Player: I keep moving, staying in front of the tanks.<br/><br/>DM: *rolls intimidate check, player holds steady* Shit, I, I mean, he doesn't want to run you over, the tanks back up and drive off.  Why did you do that?<br/><br/>Player: *shrugs* felt like the right thing<br/><br/>I feel like if it isn't two *people* looking at each other in that conflict, even re-enacted, there is something going a little awry in the portrayal.  Figuring out the fate of a nation or revolution just seems out of place.  The resolution mechanic, outside of the character's courage, seems out of place.<br/><br/>It only makes powerful sense when, even just for a moment, the DM takes the tank driver's perspective and just can't do it.  If the DM takes the opposite tactic and does run the character down, well, that is a different sort of powerful statement.                        </div>

                            In coup d'etat, one of my <a href="http://www.headsofstate.net" rel="nofollow">heads of state</a> games, you would pay persuasion points to stop the tanks. The cost would be based on the number of soldiers you were stopping times the higest status soldier involved, with additional costs if the player just decided to take the action, few costs if you had planned it in advance.<br/><br/>In crimes against humanity the player prosecuting a charge would describe how the poor man was crushed and interview a witness, maybe a bystander or one of the tank drivers. Later the other players would vote on whether the dictator bore responsibility for this event.<br/><br/>In As I lay Dying, a player would introduce this memory on behalf of the tyrant on his death bed, who perhaps was remembering it as part of a surfacing feelings of guilt. After the scene was narrated or acted out, the lead player rolls dice to see if the memory 'sticks' and is considered factual or fails and is viewed as a rumor. If it sticks then this scene would end up in the dictator's obituary.<br/><br/>In Subversive Words, the scene could be experienced directly by the dissident writer or be a fictional account in the writer's underground novel/play etc. In the writer's world the player would have to move the emotional wheel so that an appropriate emotion was in play. In the book world the player would have to play a scrabble letter relevant to the main thrust of the scene (ie T for tank)<br/><br/>In Rest &amp; Relaxation the player would have a real newspaper article on some kind of street demo and transform it to be a memory of this event happening. Then players would vote on whether the altered story was appropriate for the target mood and did a good job using the source story. <br/><br/>maybe others in the series, but I'm probably pushing it already in some of these examples<br/><br/>edit- oh yeah- in the disappeared, this would be a nice scene for one of the innermost cards. The game would have been about a person who was disappeared by the regime during the uprising, and clues would build suggesting the missing person was swept up in some street demo, and this would advance the solution of the mystery.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Isbo</cite>The thing that is so striking about the events surounding Tank Man is...well, the incredible intimacy of the moment--it's two men, tank man and tank driver, standing before each other....</blockquote>
Except that the tank driver has the tank commander talking to/screaming at him over the intercom. And, in the admittedly unlikely case that the lead tank isn't the platoon commander's tank (platoon = 3-5 vehicles), the platoon commander's a couple of tanks back going, "Hey, why the fuck did you stop?" over the radio. And you just have to switch frequencies to raise company HQ and God knows what CCP internal security types who are commanding the whole operation.<br/><br/>Plus tanks are notoriously blind at close quarters, especially if they're "buttoned up" like these ones, i.e. their hatches are closed. (US tank commanders routinely stick their heads out of the hatch, even in downtown combat in Iraq, because they simply can see so much better). The driver sits in the front of the hull with a little slit of armored glass, so he can see right in front of him -- which probably means he can see Tank Man, most of the time. The tank commander sits up in the turret, so he actually has 360 visibility, but as long as he doesn't stick his head out of the hatch, he's looking through vision slits or a little periscope at the top of the turret, which means he has a very narrow field of vision and probably some big blind spots right next to the tank where the turret itself blocks his view.<br/><br/>So we know what's happening with Tank Man. He's standing alone. But inside the tank? Is the tank commander saying, "Crush him, dammit!" and the driver saying, "No"? Or, more probably, it's the driver saying, "What do I do, sir?" and the tank commander is saying, "Uh, try going righ...-- shit! Stop! You're gonna crush him. Okay. Okay. Left - NO! STOP! Dammit, did we run right over him? Fucking periscope -- fucking periscope -- whew! I see him, he's okay, he was just in my blind spot for a minute. He's going to keep doing this, isn't he? Fuck. I do NOT want to make this decision."                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><br/>Part of the discussion ended up focusing on how resolutions systems based on character abilities can end up putting GMs into real binds when the type of action being taken is clearly not something the system supports.<br/><br/>The game is a story of political revolution, of a country with a history of brutal human rights abuse on the eve of a possible cultural revolution lead by students, philosophers, and unions. The powerful regime has sent in the military to end protests and public gatherings, authorizing use of lethal force. Tanks are rolling down the street on the well to quell the movement, and by the end of the day thousands of people will be dead.<br/><br/>Then one player announces "I step out into the street, still holding my groceries in my hand. I walk into the path of the tanks and raise my hand for them to stop. If they try to go around me I step into the way, but I offer no other resistance. They will either stop or they will have to run me over where I stand. I face the world with courage and compassion, and hope that it is the sort of place that can face me back with honesty."<br/><br/>What do you have the player do in order to meet her intent?</blockquote>
<b>Amber DRPG</b><br/><br/>Amber DRPG defines five attributes of conflict (or four and a tie-breaker if you like). For many games, I've used the system but redefined the attributes to match what the game cares about:<br/><br/>in this case, I'll just suppose that the game cares about =<br/>Culture = all competition within the governing system<br/>Ideas = mental flexibility freedom and complexity<br/>Coup = social grace<br/>Endurance<br/>Stuff<br/><br/>(for no particular reason, I'll keep two attributes from the original game, Endurance and Stuff.)
<blockquote>DM (setting color, tone): You are returning home from the grocery store, see the tanks rolling down the street, knowing in your heart where they are headed, knowing the danger...<br/><br/>Player (interrupting): I step in front of the column of tanks.<br/><br/>DM: What? It's a tank, you've got groceries...<br/><br/>Player: I step in front of the column.<br/><br/>DM: ok, it starts to turn to go around you...<br/><br/>Player: I keep moving, staying in front of the tanks.<br/><br/>DM: ok, what attribute is in contest here?<br/><br/>Player: I'd prefer <b>Ideas</b>, but I don't know if anyone is watching or could hear me from inside the tank or the nearby neighborhood. So I'm making this a <b>Coup</b> contest,  risky since I don't know the tank commander at all. Passive stance Coup, working off the pure connect between me and the guy driving that lead tank.<br/><br/>DM: If you break eye contact with the tank guys, you could rally bystanders with Ideas. Gonna try?<br/><br/>Player: Nope. I'll use Coup.<br/><br/>DM (excited): Wow. The tank stops. Man, the whole line of tanks stops! Your Stuff is 1, right?<br/><br/>Player: Uh, oh. Yes. (waits for other shoe....)<br/><br/>DM: Ok, then. Off-screen, the platoon commander radios to brigade for instructions. You've got time and then some. What are you doing now, dude?

<i>Except that the tank driver has the tank commander talking to/screaming at him over the intercom....</i><br/><br/>Good point--the moment, to my mind, is still that driver, that pedestrian.  Sure, there is a chain beyond that, but that chain rests upon the first, the two.  The chain of people beyond that is what gives the moment its amplitude, but it begins with two people, facing each other.  It goes up the chain ("wtf do i do sir?), back down the chain ("Tell him to run him over, tell him to go another way, tell him..."), but the whole chain sits atop that pivot of two people facing each other, pausing in front of each other.  A resolution system that jumps beyond that encounter *right away* to resolve big issues about the revolution, the nation, just isn't focused on what I find interesting about the scene.  Or, more importantly, the intent that Brand wants his player to be able to meet.<br/><br/>Now, if you had a player as the driver, a player as his commander, a player as the big wig back at HQ...whewee, then we have a meaty scene with several different tasks being resolved, all coming back to the driver, to the pedestrian.  For example, what happens if another tank driver is ordered to run down the pedestrian or if the gunner starts to draw a bead on the pedestrian?  If there is a person situated in those choice positions, then the profoundly ethical dimension of that scene (question of compassion) only gets amped up more.  <br/><br/>Which makes me think that as soon as this scene starts to unfold, you want other players jumping on board, taking over other key parts in the scene.  You want smaller scenes, feeding toward that big scene where we figure out what happens to tank man.  I don't know if this quite falls under the umbrella of 'resolution' but it seems like an important element of it.<br/><br/>Although I don't have time to map it out, I bet DitV's system of raises could be meaningfully brought to bear on this sort of scene...TSOY's bringing down the pain would probably work, too.  Both get us to the question of how much you are willing to risk, to wager, how far until you back down.  Although you want to keep actual damage from entering the scene, because it is the threat and not the result upon which the scene builds.  Hmmm...                        </div>

                            Hmmm.  After further thought and discussion, I'm starting to think that maybe modeling this as a conflict between Tank Man and Tank Driver isn't the right way to go about it at all.<br/><br/>It's two conflicts.  One conflict is between Tank Man and The War Machine.  The other conflict is between Tank Driver and The War Machine.  Just humour me for a minute with this.<br/><br/>Depending on your system, Tank Man has already won.  His conflict here was "Am I brave enough to stand up to The War Machine?"  The GM might just give it to him, or the GM might use some sort of game mechanism to determine the outcome.<br/><br/>The conflict between Tank Driver and The War Machine is <i>also</i> "Am I brave enough to stand up to The War Machine?"  <br/><br/>I think the reason this fell into my own personal blind spot is that it's framed as an NPC versus NPC conflict, and as a GM I just instinctually avoid that sort of thing.  But let's take a little detour down the scenario and consider the situation if both Tank Man and Tank Driver were players.<br/><br/>I'm going to switch over to PrimeTime Adventures here.  Tank Man announcing he's going to try to stand in front of the tanks.  The other players love it -- they're throwing gobs of Fan Mail at him.  Everyone wants this to succeed.<br/><br/>Tank Driver announces he's going to try to not run over the other player.  The other players love this just as much -- more Fan Mail comes on in.  Especially from Tank Man.<br/><br/>Now we can see Tank Man and Tank Driver as unlikely allies against The War Machine.  Tank Man is trying to <i>help</i> Tank Driver.  "We're in this together, you and I," I can hear him saying.  "I have found the courage to stand alone against The War Machine.  So can you.  We can stand together."<br/><br/>Damn, I want to play this in PrimeTime Adventures <i>right now.</i><br/><br/>Also, now I know how I'd handle this sort of thing in any given system.  I'd turn over Tank Driver to a player.                        </div>

You know, honestly, that's the best result in any system.  On the other hand, I think with <cite>Polaris</cite> the real result is "But only if your entire family is seized and killed over the next day."  Which isn't bad either.  <br/><br/>Seriously, though, it seems like this is the sort of moment a system should mostly remain silent on.  It's a "say yes," because dice might cheapen it.  What alternative would be more satisfying in the moment than the tanks stop?  (Maybe, maybe: "the tank command opens his hatch and kills tank man with his sidearm") Get to the consequences, because they're all that will contribute to the impact.<br/><br/>That said: <br/><br/><cite>Repertoire</cite><br/>The hostile enclave wants to wipe out the company with their tank.  Stakes: 3 commerce dice.  At least three.  On the other hand, plenty of facts to build on: the actor involved and his steely resolve, plus the tyranny in his home enclave.  The ruthless determination of the enclave.  The producer's ability to command blind loyalty.  Obviously, the failed result is that they gun the engine to run him down and break his foot as his avoids being crushed - which pisses off the producer because now he has to put an understudy on stage.<br/><br/><cite>Spy Game</cite><br/>Either this encounter is related: "Sir, we're getting reports of a protester <em>standing down</em> Chinese tanks in the wake of the Tianamen Square incident" with the accompanying heavy proposal of Guojia Anquan Bu influence.  Or, mid-mission in the midst of unrest, tank man steps into the street as a wrench in the works.  Could be an ace or a king pretty much anywhere.                        </div>

It's a "say yes," because dice might cheapen it. <br/><br/>I'm leaning this direction myself. I don't know if it's that dice 'cheapen' it so much as are likely to miss the point. The dice could choose an outcome or deliver the consequences -- in the many ways described in this thread -- but I don't think that moment is so striking because of any possible outcome or consequence. The act itself is already complete, and the act gains power by encompassing all possible consequences -- the entire list of possible results all make the action more courageous, the moment more tense. I think trying to resolve the question of whether the tanks run him over, or whether the revolution is stopped, is taking something away from the situation, not improving it, because you are inevitably addressing only one small part of the situation.<br/><br/>But I guess that's just a general argument against resolution.                        </div>

<br/>See, the only thing is - and maybe this is what Brand was trying to get at - is that, presented with such a dramatic situation, such an offer or character emulation by one of the players, i don't think i'd be willing to just give the conflict, or skip over the moment and make the conflict the larger issue. I might very well include the after-effects in the resolution of the conflict, but i don't think i would let the moment go by without a challenge.<br/><br/>I don't see how - as a game situation arrising organically - we can tell that this kind of playing to character is different from any other good play that puts a character at risk - or why we would want to treat it differently.

I'm putting my dice into that aspect."<br/>Chris: "Me too."<br/>GM: "I'm putting a lot of dice against stopping the tanks, and a few against your looking badass."<br/>Matt S: "This is a total showdowm, so I'm using Warrior, putting equal dice into both. Not that I have many left."<br/>Chris: "Kadin is yelling out, 'yeah, you show them!'"<br/>***rolling and stuff***<br/>GM: "Well, looks like you lose the facing down part. I'll say that someone has to get out and drag you from the street. But you did win the respect of your crew by not flinching."<br/>John: "So now Fiona has new respect for her dad."<br/>Chris: "Kadin is thinking, 'damn, maybe that boy has something in him after all.'"<br/>Snyder: "Sweet, bonus dice for later on. Plus I'm going to spend some Fortune to get a new connection. One of the people in the crowd is part of the Underground and saw what Gideon did."<br/>John: "Man, this is the best game ever. It's so much cooler than anything Brand Robins could write."                        </div>

                            You could play this in PEQ, but a scenario would have to be developed that could end in this type of situation. This would be the scenario in PEQ:<br/><br/><b>Mission Type</b>: Unconventional Warfare (UW)<br/><br/><b>Situation</b>: A people's revolution is on the verge of being crushed, and although the country is our biggest trading partner, it is against our interest to allow that to happen. All progress towards civil rights will be destroyed if this is allowed to happen.<br/><br/><b>The Mission</b>: After insertion, the team will coordinate with the leaders of the revolution to develop a situation unfavorable to our trading partner's continued oppression of civil rights.<br/><br/><b>Final Situation</b>: In this mission, only one of these three outcomes can occur: 1. The team can fail completely and all die. 2. The team can grow an underground movement, which will in the future influence the change in the government. 3. 1000s will be killed, but a powerful image for the continuation of the revolution will be broadcast worldwide putting political pressure on the trading partner.<br/><br/>Half of the team splits and the Rogue side is working towards number three. It is threat level six and the rogue team only needs one Steel Point to convert to a success for them to reach threat level seven. The rogue operators see the tanks coming down the street. The Rogue WO orders his Communications Sgt to video tape the scene for broadcast back to ODB, and then, because he is dressed in native clothing and looks native, the WO decides to step out in front of the tank and block it from moving.<br/><br/><b>Skills Used</b>: The CS is using Computers &amp; Communications and spending a Steel Point. The WO is using Enemy Tactics, because he knows how the enemies chain of command will operate. He knows the driver will stop, the tank officer will pass off the decision to platoon commander, PC to HQ. The tank will stop long enough to create a good video. The WO is also spending a Steel Point.<br/><br/><b>Resolution</b>: The CS passes his skill test, but fails the Steel Point. He is able to record whatever is going to happen, but doesn't move the team to winning the scenario. The WO passes his knowledge of enemy tactics and indeed the tank stops. He also succeeds in his Steel Point roll. This moves the team into Threat Level Seven and the rogue team is close to winning. This will result in outcome three. Now the team will have to survive a final fight in an alley and near the video camera to see if they can get the video broadcast. the CS and WS will fight, and the WO just stands in front of the tank. They will have to kill the 21 soldiers that the Red Army has dispatched to take out the video feed.                        </div>

<br/>
Tank - Armour [+4] Tank [+2] Slow [-2]<br/>
<br/>
Protester - Wants a better world [+6] Resolute [+6] Everyday Life [-2]<br/>
<br/>
Protester -"I step out into the street, still holding my groceries in my hand. I walk into the path of the tanks and raise my hand for them to stop. If they try to go around me I step into the way, but I offer no other resistance. They will either stop or they will have to run me over where I stand. I face the world with courage and compassion, and hope that it is the sort of place that can face me back with honesty." <br/>
Gm - "Now I want you roll : Wants a better world and  Resolute  for a total of +12  against the tanks ...... ummmmm no qualites  damn! dice roll happens. The Tanks  stop ! <br/>
<br/>
ok true this is entirely weighted on the protesters side but simple as anything in this system.                        </div>

                            Since you're alluding to Tianamen Square, it's a good opportunity to break out the I Ching-based resolution system, in which the character's action determines the lower trigram (player's call) and the nature of the world's opposition, resistance, or recalcitrance determines the upper trigram (GM's call).  The two together form a hexagram whose oracular meaning is interpreted by the player.<br/><br/>Let's see...the character's action is <i>ken</i>, "arresting progress" while the tanks are <i>chen</i>, "movement, perilousness."  The resulting hexagram is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2362&amp;Mode=like">#62</a>, <i>Hsiao Kuo</i>, "Small Excesses," and the accompanying judgment is that "there will be progress and attainment.  But it will be advantageous to be firm and correct; small excesses are permitted in small affairs, but not in great affairs.  Like the notes that come down from a bird on the wing:  to descend is better than to ascend.  There will in this way be great good fortune."<br/><br/>[The player may then make reference to his Sun Tzu in order to determine the degree to which his behavior while firm departs from the (tactically) correct].<br/><br/>"Hmm," says the player.  "I guess I can stop them for a little while, since delaying the tanks is a small affair but sending them back to their barracks is a great one.  To ascend would be to advance toward the tank, while to descend would be to melt back into the crowd.  So how about I'm pulled back into the throng, and the tanks roll by as I watch, shaken, lucky not to have been killed?"<br/><br/>"All right.  What about the bit about the notes coming down from the bird on the wing?"<br/><br/>"That's--oh, wait a minute.  How about the image of me in front of the tanks gets picked up by the news media and descends via satellite link upon the rest of the world, putting pressure on the regime in the days and weeks ahead?"<br/><br/>"I can live with that."                        </div>

                            I have to agree with Judson on how it would fly in <i>Polaris</i>. You, as player, will eagerly accept such horrible stipulation, because it will let you keep your awesome in the game. And your opponent knows it. <i>Twist the knife!</i> </div>
