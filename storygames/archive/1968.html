<p>Hiya all.  For those of you that don't know, <em>the Infected</em> is my game-in-production about monster movies.  Very specifically, it's about the kind of movies where the protagonists and everyone they know and love are being threatened with turning into monsters themselves.  Like zombie movies.  Dig?</p>
<p>It's been something like a month and a half since I've really done any work on it at all.  Personal &amp; financial issues kinda drained away my creativity for a while.  But now I'm back and chugging away.</p>
<p>The last playtest was run by <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21841.0" rel="nofollow">Mark Causey at Camp Nerdly 0</a>.  The session was far from a resounding success, but the players were able to hit me with some excellent feedback.  The biggest stumbling blocks in the session seemed to be the weak-ass prose that I was using in lieu of the art that the game needs, but hadn't been produced yet as well as the "secrecy thang".  Both of those issues are off the table right now though.  I'm quite confident that the finished art product will fix the prose issues and the secrecy thing is totally fixed with the new reading of what you're supposed to do with the cards.</p>
<p>In fact, Joe, I realize upon reading that thread again I never directly replied to you about if the secrecy thing even exists anymore.  The answer is:  It can exist, if the individual player wants it to.  But only until the first time they lay down a chip on a conflict.  Because that's the moment they <em>must</em> tell everyone what's so broken about their character's life.</p>
<p>What has been really itching in my brain is something that Mark said in his meaty post there on the second page.</p>
<p><em>My mind keeps coming back to how I'd like to play the game. I know that this won't necessarily vibe with the game as written currently, but .... get rid of the GM and let everyone play a character.</em></p>
<p>And what's weird is, my immediate reaction upon reading this was <em>Mark's totally right.  The GM needs something to invest in.</em>  Which is totally not what he said.  But that's what I heard.  The GM gets nothing to invest in throughout the course of the game, and that sucks a bit.  The GM doesn't get to engineer any situation, author any secrets, or even really keep control of any uber-kewl villians.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what I was thinking of today when the solution dawned on me.  There is always at least one awesome-kewl villain in every session of <em>the Infected</em>.  It's the infection!  See, right now, creating the infection during play is very hippy-style.  It's a general consensus thing where everyone gets their say on what the infection is, where it came from, and what kind of effect it has on people.  But hey, what if that was all the baliwick of the GM exclusively?  What if the GM was allowed/encouraged to create the infection in the same way that one might create a character?</p>
<p>This is what I'm imagining.  The game would start with all the players authoring the setting in the same hippy style as before.  A little bit of consensus and excitement-following about where &amp; when the story should take place.  But, after the Motivation Cards are handed out, and while the players are taking a moment to interpret what those cards mean to them, the GM takes a moment to jot down some quick and directed notes on the infection.</p>
<p>What is the origin of the infection?  I think sticking with the same three broad categories (industrial, natural, and supernatural) will be cool.  The GM should also make a quick and more specific note about the origin.  Like:  <em>The priest left a curse on his bastards!</em>, or <em>Industrial waste accident!</em>, or some such.</p>
<p>What is the vector of the infection?  How is it transferred from one character to another?  It may seem minor and trivial, but it really does hold a lot of flavor.  An infection spread by mosquito is going to have a different story than one spread by bite or one spread by The Seven Evil Words.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of the infection?  This will totally be a super-fun area.  I'm imagining the GM should be jotting down a handful of symptoms that appear in infected characters.  Which could totally be anything from "blotchy skin" to "running puss" to "reanimates after death" to "howls at the moon".  I'm also imagining that the text of the game could include a long list of example symptoms.  The final text here would have to be careful to not loose the underlining fact that the infection turns everyone into monsters eventually.  An infection with nothing but mundane sympoms would fall flat.  Even if there are no gross physical transformations, there still needs to be something monsterous there.  As exhibit A, I present to you <strong>28 Days Later</strong>.  No massive physical transformations.  Not even the walking dead.  Just a monsterous desire to spread the infection coupled with a penchant for sprinting.</p>
<p>Now, I'm imagining that taking those three 'stats' for the infection, keeping it's nature within the GM's authority, and some text alluding to treating the infection it's self like a villain that's out to ruin the PCs, and I theorize that now the GM has something to invest in.  It's still just a theory in need of testing.  And I welcome any thoughts or opinions.</p>

                            So, Eric, I like this. A lot.<br/><br/>The first thought I had after reading that is:<br/>-have the GM draw a Need card, and try to fill the Infection's need. Think about what the Martyr card would mean in the hands of a zombie horde.<br/><br/>...I'm not entirely sure if I was serious or not.<br/><br/>I want to question the "secret until first conflict" thing. I think that's cool, but stopping to declare "oh, by the way, this all stems from my need to re-unite with my father. You see, he's a banker from..." would trip up the scene. I think all Needs should be declared before play starts.<br/><br/>I think that this gives the GM an interest and investment, but I don't think it necessarily solves (a part of) the problem Mark was talking about. Let me give you a quick refresh of part of our game:<br/><br/>I snap. I go fucking mental. From whiney emo artist to goreshow in no time flat. I arrive at my girlfriend's doorstep drenched in blood, with a shard of glass as my weapon, to rescue her. I slaughter more zombies on my way back to the safehouse.<br/><br/>...I get to the safehouse, and they won't let me in. I'm infected. I tell them I don't care about myself, I just want them to take in my girlfriend. They won't.<br/><br/>I bust down the door, and they shoot at me. Fighting breaks out in the safehouse, over how to handle the situation of me, and who's really in control, and who should be let in, and "what are we coming to, anyways?!"<br/><br/>And Mark says "zombies are pressing close, and they are going to attempt to attack you."<br/><br/>And... sure, he could have thrown more zombies in throughout. He could have said "zombies!" at every corner during this long string of disputes. But, it wouldn't have added any tension to the situation. The real horror at that point was that the humans were pointing guns at each other, and no zombie horde could heighten that. So Mark didn't want to derail the action. He felt comfortable letting us have at it with rusty knives for a bit.<br/><br/>...And thus, we won our Story Goals, because the zombie pressure wasn't there. The issue wasn't "Mark wasn't putting pressure on us", but "there is no way for the GM to heighten interpersonal tension, so if we turn inward we will likely all win our story goals".<br/><br/>I like your Infection-as-character thing, but also want to add an idea.<br/><br/>I am foggy on the details of the system, so if I botch details just fix them. The GM should be able to give us Infection dice, instead of rolling them on a infected's behalf. Essentially, we become the infected for that moment. If we win, we normally get to move a story chip. But, if the INFECTED dice we roll dominate (somehow) the REGULAR dice we roll, its a victory for the infected. We resolve no chips.<br/><br/>...Thus, if me and Kevin Allen Jr. get into a mexican standoff, pointing guns at each other and screaming, Mark Causey can just be like "I'm giving Joe 2 Infected dice and Kevin 1. You guys are horrorshow enough for this scene without the addition of zombies". I roll my regular dice, the 1 infected die I already had, plus the 2 Infected dice Mark just temporarily gave me. I beat Kevin, but my infected dice beat my regular dice, thus I don't move closer to resolving my story goal - all I do is fuck everyone over, but come out on top.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>

<p><em>"there is no way for the GM to heighten interpersonal tension, so if we turn inward we will likely all win our story goals".</em></p>
<p>Before we really go into details on how to fix this issue, I need to understand exactly what happened more clearly.  So, I hope you'll forgive me when I totally gloss over your suggested fix for now.</p>
<p>Who was your character in conflict with when you put in your chip, making it an important story goal?  The safehouse folks?  Where they NPCs?  Important NPCs, the kind that were authored on slips of paper?  Was there another player involved in the conflict, and on which side?  Did they also put in chips on this conflict?</p>
<p>Edited to add:  I think what we're talking about now is a completely seperate issue from what I was attacking with the infection-as-character thing.  However, I suspect that the two issues may end up coming together in the solution.  Which remains to be seen.</p>

Breathers.<br/><br/>Zombie movies have breathers.  28 Days later, in the convenience stop.   A pause in the action, a little side scene where someone goes "So, what's <i>your </i>deal?", and we all find out.                        </div>

                            I was playing a whiney emo artist kid.<br/>Kevin Allen Jr. was playing a wigged-out drug addict.<br/><br/>Everyone was holed up in his safehouse.<br/><br/>My Need was to save my girlfriend. I forget his need.<br/><br/>My immediate goal was to get her into the safehouse by force. That meant kicking in the door, and that was forwarding my goals. I think I slid a chip forward.<br/>I don't remember if K-to-the-A-with-the-Junior slid a chip forward or not. His goal was to shoot out my kneecaps, I think.<br/><br/>In general: sometimes a player character directly opposes another player character. We did this many times in our game. We sometimes were sliding chips as a result of that, because it furthered our goals. Mark throwing zombies into the mix so he wasn't left out would have... been just that. It would have been the GM tossing in dice so he wasn't left out. If the horror turns inwards, there needs to be a way for the GM to mechanically re-enforce that, if the GM role still exists.<br/><br/><br/>[My suggestion is that the GM gets to feed us Infection dice (if he wants to) when we become monsters (by turning on our allies), but if the monster within (represented by the infected dice we roll) trumps the hero within (regular dice), then our chips are not resolved nor are our goals REALLY moved forward.]                        </div>

                            These are my preliminary thoughts. I'm kinda rushed today.
<blockquote><cite>Eric said:</cite>What if the GM was allowed/encouraged to create the infection in the same way that one might create a character? </blockquote>
Okay, cool. Take narration of the infectionâ€™s changes and growth and the victimsâ€™ activities out of the other playersâ€™ hands and let these responsibilities fall solely on the GM. I sorta did this at one point at Camp Nerdly 0. I had them start to catch on fire as a progression. Would it be cool to have significant descriptions tie to the amount of dice used by the GM? For example: If in the second act I have only zombies that suck on fear attack the characters (which was established in the first act), Iâ€™ll use one die. But if I were to narrate that their prehensile nerves had wormed their way out of their body and were being used for attacking and grabbing, which I established in this act, I could use two dice?
<blockquote><cite>Eric said:</cite>What is the vector of the infection? How is it transferred from one character to another? It may seem minor and trivial, but it really does hold a lot of flavor. An infection spread by mosquito is going to have a different story than one spread by bite or one spread by The Seven Evil Words.</blockquote>
Very cool addition to the Infection repertoire. I like it.
<blockquote><cite>Eric said:</cite>An infection with nothing but mundane sympoms would fall flat.</blockquote>
Maybe categorize typical symptoms into â€œMundaneâ€, â€œSemi-monstrousâ€, and â€œMonstrousâ€ (or, even Act 1, 2, or 3).

Iâ€™m all for it at this point. Iâ€™ve always liked the Infection itself a little more than my characters, anyway.

I can see a few possibilities to fix this. You could have a follow up scene immediately afterward to explain, heighten the tension by calling for a flashback in the middle of the terror, or make sure you explain it beforehand if itâ€™ll take a while.                        </div>

                            Well Eric, I've questioned the need for a GM role since the beginning ... I think those infected dice are your GM.  In Joe's example, those dice get tossed around like fanmail to the participants who are advancing the infection's agenda, whatever that is.  Maybe its agenda is always the same - to fuck shit up and increase entropy.  Are you fucking shit up?  Here, have some dice.  <br/><br/>Of course, I'm an anti-GM zealot, but there you go.                        </div>

<p>Jason,</p>
<p>I know you don't believe in the power of the GM in this game.  That's cool.  But I'm out of ways to explain why it's just not a good option to go without.  I didn't put the GM in this game out of habit.  I put the GM in this game because I feel that it adds something vital and important to the play.  I am open to improving and refining the GM experience.  But I am not open to removing the GM from the system.</p>
<p>edited to add:  I'll be back later on tonight or tomorrow with better responses for everything else.  Today is TSOY day, and I'm behind schedule for getting prepared.  Catcha all later.</p>

<p>Levi,</p>
<p>Breathers.  Great idea.  I'll have to dig &amp; look &amp; see if there's some way I can smoothly incorporate them.</p>
<p>Joe,</p>
<p>Well, I'm not getting a clear picture of what went down that made it feel too easy to win your goals.  Which isn't a huge deal right now, because I still see lots of playtesting in the future for this game, so if it's a repeating issue I'll be sure to see it again.  And the more I see it, the more likely I can fix it properly.</p>
<p>But, for now, instead of talking about that specific game, I can speak generally about the GM and his obligation to disrupt the goals of the characters and what tools he has at his disposal.</p>
<p>The first GM tool is his single basic D6.  The GM can roll this die for narrating pretty much anything.  From narrating an angry NPC to an earthquake to the lack of adequate lighting.  If the GM narrates then he gets to use that die.  Granted, it's not much on it's own, but it's easy to get it some backup.  If Jason is rolling toe to toe with Lisa and I want Jason to win the conflict, then I can narrate in some help for him (or just some obstacles for Lisa) and roll that die.  Now Jason can use it as one of his own if it's good enough.</p>
<p>The second GM tool are the named NPCs.  Once a player puts a name on an NPC slip, that doesn't mean that the GM has to wait for the NPC to go to monster status to narrate them or use their dice.  If the GM can narrate a named NPC as your opposition, and none of the players are willing or able to reverse that narration, then the GM gets those dice.  Furthermore, if the named NPC is <em>infected</em>, then you can't reverse the narration.  The GM can totally trump and use those dice.  So, in the Jason v. Lisa scenario I could narrate a named NPC into the scene to help Jason win over Lisa if I wanted to.  Or, if the GM is pretty confident that the NPC dice plus the base D6 are enough, I could roll as a third branch of the conflict without adding my dice to either of the other characters.</p>
<p>Of course, once a named NPC goes monster, then it's all the GMs to use.</p>
<p>The third and final tool for the GM to fuck with your goals is, of course, the infected dice.  According to the current text of the rules, the GM gets those dice when there's a monster in the scene.  The number of dice the GM may roll is dependant on how likely it is that the PCs can escape the violence of the monsters and the current scene number.</p>
<p>Ok, so that's what the GM has that he can use, right?  So let's cover a couple different situations and where they might break down.  In all these situations, let's assume that it's totally inappropriate for the GM to use any infected dice.  There are no monsters and there's no good reason to bring a monster into the scene.  In fact, bringing a monster into the scene at that particular point may be counter-awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Situation 1</strong><br/>
Player A vs. Player B in conflict.  Player A has wagered a chip, but Player B has not.  In this situation, the GM should be all about helping out Player B.  It should be really easy for the GM to bring in at least his base D6 just to help player B out.  Some situational or setting narration that either makes things easy for Character B or hard for Character A.  No problem.   If there are named NPCs currently unclaimed (or monsterous/infected) then the GM should be narrating them in, if it can be made to make sense.  If none of the current available named NPCs can logically show up, then the GM can always narrate in a new NPC and try to make them so awesome that someone wants to immediately jot that character's name down on a slip.</p>
<p>Even if the only thing the GM can add is his base D6, then this situation should still be good.  Player A can only gain the advantage if he either has more NPCs on his side than player B or if he's using his own infected dice.  In the first case he's risking the welare of the NPCs and in the second he's becoming a monster himself, and is therefore not winning his goal cheaply.</p>
<p><strong>Situation <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a></strong><br/>
Player A vs. Player B.  Both players have wagered a chip.  The GM cannot loose here.  One of these players is not going to loose their chip.  It's totally awesome.  The GM might throw his weight behind helping the player who currently holds the most chips or he might just form a third branch to the conflict to try to keep either player from winning.</p>
<p><strong>Situation <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a></strong><br/>
Multiple PCs vs. an NPC.  More than one PC has dropped a chip for this conflict.  This situation... shit, this might just be broken as all hell.  If the NPC dice the GM starts with aren't formidable enough to challenge the PCs and the GM can't summon up any monstery goodness, then the players are almost certain to win this one hands down.</p>
<p>I think I'll need to see this breakdown occurr in play before I can figure out how to patch it.  I suspect that while I'm trying to fix something else, I'll end up patching this situation before it ever even comes up.</p>
<p>A question just occurred to me.  You guys played the first playtest with the Desperate &amp; Crazy modification.  Which makes it easier for the PCs to win ties, but also should be eating the hell out of the NPCs.  Were the Desperate / Crazy players assigning the extra point of Harm to their NPCs in those conflicts?</p>
