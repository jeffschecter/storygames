Let's say I'm coming at this as a complete outsider, someone who doesn't know anyone who is an established part of the hobby, hasn't ever been to the Forge (let alone participated in those discussions) and has no awareness of the wide scattering of blogs which compose most of the hobby's development now. Given all that, improbable as it may be, let's say I'm interested in picking up the hobby cold. Where do I go? What single, unified text do I turn to to explain to me relationship maps, scene-based resolution, flags and other such core concepts.

It's kinda like hearing about all these awesome new German Board Games, and wanting to find the Instrumental German Board Game, that will explain everything that is cool about German Board Games. German Board Games usually involve strategy, not a lot of die rolling (if any), play that begins and ends in about 90 minutes, card based randomizers, trading, a goal system where you have "x resources" and the winner is the one whose Lowest Resource is higher than anyone else's Lowest Resource.<br/><br/>Settlers? Puerto Rico? Tigris &amp; Euphrates? Tikal? El Grande?  <br/>Settlers has dice, though.<br/>Tigris &amp; Euphrates really doesn't have a lot of trading.<br/>El Grande is a little dated.<br/>Puerto Rico has "Roles", and not a lot of inter-person trading<br/><br/>It's hard to find the "quintissential german board game, by which playing it exposes you to All the core elements of those kinds of games". So as Jason says, why not go to a club/local meetup, try a few, and see which ones you like? That's probably the best thing.<br/><br/>I think the equivalent of Settlers of Catan (for German Board Games) in the Story Games world *might* be Primetime Adventures. The equivalent of Puerto Rico *might* be Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78359/#Comment_78359" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T08:37:29+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  8:37AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2007 8:37AM by Graham.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What single, unified text do I turn to to explain to me relationship maps, scene-based resolution, flags and other such core concepts. </blockquote>\nI think it's the Forge.

The reason I say is this is because, although D&amp;D was my first game, it was so because of name recognition and an interest in fantasy. By the time I got it (Christmas 1982: Basic and Expert sets... wrapped together in green, gold, and red plaid paper), it wasn't the only game in the market, nor was it even the best for a beginner. If I could go back in time, I'd probably tell myself to get Tunnels &amp; Trolls, or even The Fantasy Trip.<br/><br/>So, what is the game that is common amongst story-gamers? What single game stands as a symbol for the "new wave?"<br/><br/>To me, it's definitely Burning Wheel. Dogs in the Vineyard runs a very, very close second... DitV is to Burning Wheel as Traveller was to D&amp;D in the olden days (for purposes of this conversation).<br/><br/>But just like D&amp;D, I don't think BW would be a very good thing to hand off to someone who doesn't know anything about the hobby. I think they could end up being so intimidated that they'd never want to play anything but Parker Bros. games ever again. So, if what you're really looking for is "What's a good game to introduce new players to the hobby" I'd have to say Donjon, it's simple, but fun... and it can be taken easily from an introduction to "I think you're ready for the 'REAL POWER' now."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78390/#Comment_78390" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T09:25:56+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  9:25AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So how do people feel about writing an intro guide, specifically designed to introduce two kinds of people to story games:\n<ol>\n<li>Newcomers to RPGs altogether</li>\n<li>Gamers who have a background in classic RPGs where the GM writes a plot and players explore it</li></ol>\nI'm trying to be as specific as possible here, to get some focus.

Jason posted that while I walked away from my machine)<br/><br/>I've noticed that most of these games often mention how they are different from traditional RPGS in the rules. There should be much less emphasis on the games being an evolution of standard RPGs. If someone who had never driven a car or ridden motorcycle asked me what it was like to drive, it wouldn't do them much good for me to say, "Well, it's a lot different than riding a motorcycle." I think that once story games just start being what they are without reference to what has come before, then the "student can best the master."<br/><br/>But it's not even just the games themselves. Reviews of games have a really bad habit of comparison, too. Even articles about traditional games will often reference games that have similar mechanics. With story games, there seems to be a lot of "This may not be what you're used to..." By the same token, I think if designers referenced the differences less, there would be less motivation for reviewers to do so as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78394/#Comment_78394" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T09:32:16+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  9:32AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2007 9:32AM by misuba.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sophie: yes.

The current basic box set is more of a board game than anything else and, judging from the number of confused newbies I've seen on the WotC boards, seems to do a pretty lousy job of introducing roleplaying concepts.<br/><br/>The closest there seems to be to a good basic boxed set is "D&amp;D for Dummies", but that's not really so much an introduction to the hobby as it is a book that tells you how to use the $100 worth of books you already bought.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't know <i>how</i> kids these days are expected to break into the hobby. The few under-twenty-somethings I've gamed with in recent years were either introduced to D&amp;D by their gamer parents (which is <i>freakin' awesome!</i>) or somehow migrated over from WoW.<br/><br/>What was cool about the 80s box set was that it represented an attempt to spread the hobby past its wargaming roots. You could buy the damn thing at <i>toy stores</i>, for crying out loud! That's something I'd really like to see today: a concerted effort to move roleplaying beyond geek culture. <br/><br/>I can think of at least half a dozen bright, imaginative, creative people I've known over the years who probably would have found roleplaying to be an engaging and rewarding hobby--<i>but</i>, since they weren't into dragons, vampires, or space ships, there wasn't a game I could show them and say "here, you might like this."

In my experience people who have never seen an RPG before have dramatically different challenges than people coming at it from playing D&amp;D or White Wolf games.  The former never have issues with how authority is parceled out, for example, while the latter generally do unless it maps to a model they've used previously.  The former often need help connecting mechanics to effect, while the latter never do.  <br/><br/>I'm not sold on "story game" as a thing, personally.  I think we're really just talking about a specific mode of play we find productive and fun.  That's semantics, but important semantics.

I guess there's some clarification required here. I'm not looking for the definitive story game game. I'm not looking for a game to start people off. I'm looking for a resource that will give people, gamers or otherwise, a glimpse and some knowledge into the hobby itself. Handing someone a game to teach them a game doesn't seem productive to me. That's handholding, and that never results in learning... teach a man to fish, you know.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd perhaps a little off the beaten path, but no less relevant is the concept of who we broadcast to with the glossary as Andy called it... that's tough. I find trying to communicate story games to hard and fast traditional gamers is tough. Hell, you're giving a niche market a niche to step into... niche within a niche? That's strange. That isn't to say that it shouldn't be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nDialoguing with non-gamers though is a little easier. I think with traditional RPGs, the fear and paranoia about playing them comes from, "All them funny dice," as opposed to a story. We're not a far shot from literature, film, expressionism.

Just to note I haven't played it yet, but am planning to in the next 2-3 months or so. But anyway, the game has you being preparation by creating a relationship map of various main characters. When you are done, you choose the characters on that map you want to play and stat them out. That's pretty hardcore "Story Gaming" there, and plus draws upon R-Maps to boot.<br/><br/>The problem is that the text kinda assumes you know what an R-Map is (or can guess at what a good one looks like) and doesn't really show you step-by-step how to do it. There's a lot of other stuff that's sort of taken for granted there, too. But it's a solid example.<br/><br/>And when I started thinking about Legends of Alyria, my mind wandered to two other games that will probably be released/in playable form/etc in the next year or so, which I totally recommend keeping an eye on (to see if you dig this style or not):<br/><br/>Vincent Baker's Art, Grace and Guts. Like LoA: You roll on some tables, figure out What the Background is, What Will Happen, and Who is Involved. Then you choose characters from the list of Who is Involved, stat them out, and roleplay. At the end of the session, you check this list to see which characters Must be played in the next scenario, and which characters will be left behind.  It's very clever. It smells like a gimmick at first, but it's a machine that produces cool stories.<br/><br/>Clinton Nixon's Inuma. You create the setting together with your friends. Then, you create a pool of characters that populate the world. Finally, you go back, choose one, and play them in an open scenario. When you're done, you put those characters back in the box, then decide which ones to play next time.<br/><br/>Please don't use this as an impetus to pester either author: :-)  They'll be done when they're done.  However, int he forms that I've played them, they are exemplary of what story games is all about: Maybe not all Flags and R-Maps, but definitely "Setting the Scope of the Story FIRST. Then make characters."<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78995/#Comment_78995" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-01T12:18:33+00:00" title="July  1, 2007 12:18PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is something that has been on and off of my radar, so forgive me for prodding at the proposal a little.<br/><br/><b>Core text by committee?</b><br/>If  people outside the hobby are to sit down and read a piece of technical non-fiction about it, I believe they need to be guided by a personal voice. I certainly wouldn't have read the GNS essays when I returned to the hobby after 10 years away, if the text wasn't delivered via a voice that engaged me (in this case, Ron Edwards's). I believe that a genuine shift in the way you think about things, and remembrance of what you have experienced, benefits enormously from a voice, an individual, telling you these things.<br/><br/>So, being a worrier, I have a bit of a worry that if half a dozen of us contributed to the Core Text, you wouldn't get that. Personal voice would be smoothed over in the service of consistency. Alternatively, voice would be piecemeal and flit from section to section. Those within the community might well enjoy those flashes of character - reading the Marginalia commentary in the Push 1 preview, I chuckled at exactly this - but that's a pleasure accorded by familiarity. <br/><br/>An alternative, and one I would love to see, is a bunch of people having a crack at this <b>independently</b>, with the community/chums acting to support these individual visions. The story game movement has been very successful writing content using this praxis, and I really think it's the one to continue with.*  I tried it <a href="http://farmerversusfox.blogspot.com/2006/03/making-case-for-story-games-i-why-make.html" rel="nofollow">over</a> <a href="http://farmerversusfox.blogspot.com/2006/03/making-case-for-story-games-ii-why.html" rel="nofollow">a</a> <a href="http://farmerversusfox.blogspot.com/2006/03/making-case-for-story-games-iii-why.html" rel="nofollow">year ago</a>, more on the general overview than specific techniques, and although it's neither definitive, pinpoint accurate, or immune to controversy, I'm pretty sure it fulfilled my immediate needs, providing something to share with curious friends if my cup-of-tea pitch** has stirred them up.<br/><br/><b>Game vs How-to</b><br/>I am absolutely certain that any Core Text must be interactive. I mean, absolutely. Just as a purely textual book about visual art could never act as an entry text to that medium, so should this contain hooks that demand doing, trying, shaping. I'm certain that Ben was not being flippant when suggesting the Pool, and agree that it or something like it should form part of any package that is trying to open up story gaming.<br/><br/><b>Go you!</b><br/>My penultimate thought is that this is something that we could all really do with. I'm really heartened that so many people are enthusiastic about this; I was only energised to write my posts back when because my social groups were almost exclusively non-gamer at that time, and it pressed upon me to explain this new activity. Opening up the hobby = 100% awesome! I might be very well wrong in exhorting an authorial perspective***. I want to make sure that people are aware of the impact of approaching this kind of project in a particular way.<br/><br/><b>Who, me? Yes, you!</b><br/>My ultimate thought is: if you want to write content for an intro to story games, consider where you are coming from. I wrote about my perspectives after 6 months of exposure to the games and a vestigial history of rpging, and it showed: in a bad way, that I was certainly oversimplifying or missing some of the variety of play due to ignorance, and in a good way, in that was fairly aware of what in gaming is novel and what is familiarity tilted on one side. If I try to improve it now - which I may still do - I must be aware that I may do harm as well as help the text, by making false assumptions or eliding what are complex issues, or worse still assume that more explanation is needed than the case. <br/><br/>So, consider your experience! I'm not warning off the veterans by any means (though they should be extra cognizant of their position). I am inviting, urging the people reading who still consider all this malarkey pretty new to consider having a stab. If not now, then in 3,4 months or so. You are probably the gateway we all wish to be.<br/><br/><br/>*Hey, I'm not forgetting the awesome projects like cons, stickers, and books of names, where it really is a genuinely shared endeavour. They are great! Different to what we're talking about here, though.<br/>**I don't do elevators.<br/>***hmmm...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78998/#Comment_78998" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-01T12:22:38+00:00" title="July  1, 2007 12:22PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ***<br/>Just  to turn 180, a really appetising prospect would be to approach the text using the democratisation of creative input attitude that fuels the games themselves.

What worked for me was to pick up one game that you think will fit what you want to play. In my case, it was PTA. I love that it can be played as a generic game system. It is fast, balanced and supports "campaign" play. I have played  a 60's Spy game, a Middle Age's and a "Heroe's" one too. I adapted a GMless version which has been working very well for us too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I see it, the other concepts are tools and are generally universal. Flags, kickers, bangs, relationship flowcharts/maps, etc. Plus, well-defined stakes for each single die-roll/card play.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnhappily, IMO, the boat is being missed somewhere because an unifying location containing all these concepts has not being created. If it happened, they would be readily available and could be more widely used and I am sure a great chunk of players and GMs would be greatly appreciative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure the reason for that and I could just especulate. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, these concepts are a work in progress and people are afraid to set them in stone. Maybe, it is more interesting to keep them scattered so they remain restricted and people have to have a true interest in Indie games to have access to them, possibly making it/us special. <br/>\n<br/>\nInitially, I bought 7 Leagues after reading about it at rpg.net and it brought me to the Indie games.<br/>\nThen, after research, I bought PTA and I could have ended here.<br/>\nBecause of my interest in playing GMless, I bought Universalis but, possibly, only because I found it in my FLGS. And, it helped me adapt my GMless version of PTA.<br/>\nI recently placed an order for Polaris and should get Grey Ranks when it comes out to understand better GMless games.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndie games helped crystalize thoughts that I had about RPGs. They provide a very positive change in paradigm. I recently played a 4-session PTA game with my friends in Brazil who are long time (&gt;15 years) traditional players and have only played D&amp;D for the past 3-4 years. And, they really, truely loved it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79940/#Comment_79940" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-07T07:30:44+00:00" title="July  7, 2007  7:30AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The following website gave me definitions of some tools/concept that Iam/was missing:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://random.average-bear.com/pmwiki.php/Sorcerer/HomePage                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79961/#Comment_79961" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-07T11:04:12+00:00" title="July  7, 2007 11:04AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Figures I'd end up starting such a engaging and active discussion the same week I decide to force myself to switch to Dvorak typing.

The Forge made it pretty clear that its constituents were, at the core at least, self-declared game designers, who would debate amongst themselves and then use their conclusions to produce and present their finished works to a more general audience. Making the discussion accessible simply wasn't a priority. The approach was somewhat justified, since it helped create a focussed, driven and involved community for the purpose of forcing a rather significant concept change on an established medium.

The main issue seems to be the fact that, apart from a few fragmentary Wikipedia articles, there is no primer.I can, <em>eventually</em>, purchase the recommended game titles and go through them. The problem lies in the fact that this will take time and money, which is in short supply.I am not aware of any role-playing game conventions in the entire <em>region</em> where I live, much less in the country where I live (that's South East Asia and Malaysia, respectively). And even then, most of them, I suspect, will focus on old-school RPGs.Yes, you're all talking shop. And not a lot of it makes sense, or would make sense, but for the fact that the terminology and language used is... unfamiliar. It's <em>jargon</em> for god's sake; I should know the feeling I'm getting, I work in IT Support.I haven't done much posting because I have this feeling that if I do, it'll end with me running away from the forum while being pelted with popcorn and the jeers of oldbies.<br/>So what's a guy to do? Seriously, other than picking up Burning Wheel and Dogs in the Vineyard and trying to sell the idea to my RP group, most of whom have <em>less</em> experience and interest than I do?</blockquote>\nHey, T-Boy, it's totally true that we use jargon here.  As I'm sure you're aware, working in IT as you do, it makes conversation a lot easier.  The price is that someone who doesn't understand the jargon has a harder time participating.  Now, there's been discussions (heated ones) on this subject in the past, but the long and short of it is, we're probably never going to stop using jargon - we just blather on to each other too damn much to explain the same concept over and over every time we post, you know?  But here's what I, personally, will do to try to meet you (and anybody else reading this who's in similar straights) halfway.  You start a thread, and ask anything you want to ask.  Anything at all.  I (and I'm sure many others) will do my level best to answer those questions, and I will furthermore do my level best to keep anyone from throwing popcorn at you.<br/><br/>Now, that's specifically on the subject of jargon.  In answer to your question about what to do, I'd recommend picking a game.  Whatever game you think will interest you and your friends the most.  (If you need some help with that, I'm always happy to explain any of the games that I've played.)  Then, buy that game.  And play it.  And talk about it here.  It may not seem like it, but most of us weren't in on this particular scene when it was born.  I know I wasn't.  But that's exactly how I became part of it: I bought and played Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>So that's my advice, and my offer.

It was helpful to me. It is also in, like, my top 10 fun games of all time.<br/><br/>There seems to be an assumption here which I think is... very wrong-headed. The assumption is that there's this one bulk of techniques and all "indie games" use those techniques. This is wrong, and harmful. For instance, I'm demo-ing Polaris for some guys who are used to playing Dogs in the Vineyard. I go "all right, we've got to a conflict," and they go "cool, what's at stake is do I beat the demon."<br/><br/>I go "wrong wrong wrong wrong I WILL GOUGE YOUR EYEBALLS OUT WITH A SPOON." There is no specific "at stake" in Polaris, there never was, and there never will be. Furthermore, if you graft in notions that you've picked up from Dogs in the Vineyard like "what's at stake is do I kill the demon", you'll kill all the interest and tension in the game dead immediately. And this really is a bigger problem than just these one guys I ran a demo for: I've seen people mutilate my poor game with it over and over. I've seen people mutilate Dogs by using PTA's stakes. I've seen people mutilate PTA by using passive GM assumptions from, I dunno where, Universalis I suppose.<br/><br/>I can see where this comes from. There are two assumptions which I think a lot of people carry over from mainstream games. The first is that role-playing game rules are infinitely graftable: a rule which is fun in game A is necessarily just as fun when used in game B.  This is true only inasmuch as your game is just a pile of rules and doesn't contain any rules which work together. The second is that all games basically use the same techniques. There's a lot more in common to between a good RIFTS GM and being a good GURPS GM than there is between being a good Dogs in the Vineyard GM and being a good Bliss Stage GM.  In fact, if you try to GM Bliss Stage like Dogs in the Vineyard, you will screw yourself out of a good time, because the GM in each game has a totally different set of responsibilities.<br/><br/>Let's take the Pool as an example, since it was linked earlier this thread. Go read it. See how, for instance, the monologue of victory rules mesh with the Pool size rules? If you ported (as many early failed attempts at the Pool children did) the monologue of victory rules straight into another role-playing game, without making them dependent on a resource pool, you totally change around what a monologue of victory means. Do you see that?  Do you also see how it would be totally futile to, say, graft a Dogs' style town creation system into the pool?  It makes no sense!  Nothing happens!<br/><br/>See how this makes defining shared terms tricky at best, harmful at worst?<br/><br/>Protect your eyeballs!<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80005/#Comment_80005" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-07T15:10:54+00:00" title="July  7, 2007  3:10PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Ben said.

The assumption is that there's this one bulk of techniques and all "indie games" use those techniques. This is wrong, and harmful. For instance, I'm demo-ing Polaris for some guys who are used to playing Dogs in the Vineyard. I go "all right, we've got to a conflict," and they go "cool, what's at stake is do I beat the demon."<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI easily understand that. But, why hide these techniques??? If you like them, you can adapt them to your favorite game. Or you can play the game that implements the technique you like the best. Or, you can mutilate another game that you like but you think would be even better if you introduced an element that was not intended for by the author. Are you going to sue me if I prefer to play Polaris using Conflict/Stakes and having fun with it???<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more information I have, the better decisions I can make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80015/#Comment_80015" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-07T17:08:46+00:00" title="July  7, 2007  5:08PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: AndyPosted By: Ronaldo<br/>\nLets make a documment that contains some of the main definitions/tips that "are commonly used/were better defined/are new to" story-games.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey Ronaldo:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis weekend, if I have time, I'll put a big fat linky thing from this page to the S-G Wiki (www.story-games.com/codex). From there, I'll start a new thread and ask folks to try to start building pages that explain some of these 'more famous' techniques, or just add their own techniques. There will probably be a lot of terminology hand-wringing, and editing, re-editing and the like in typical Wikipedia Warz style, but like Jason I think it's attainable and worth giving a shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll try to come up with a methodology that lets people characterize stuff, and tries to take the fangs out of some of the jargon (take 5 people who use Bangs, and probably three of those people have one idea of what a Bang "really is", and the other two each have their own ideas about what a Bang "really is", frex). I want to do this in a way that offers interested folks techniques without getting hung up on definition minutiae.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll start this up this coming week.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Andy<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would be great! Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't get me wrong, I have been browsing this website and reading books for the better part of 9 months now. I have a fair grasp of most of the concepts by now.

Whatever game you think will interest you and your friends the most. (If you need some help with that, I'm always happy to explain any of the games that I've played.) Then, buy that game. And play it. And talk about it here. It may not seem like it, but most of us weren't in on this particular scene when it was born. I know I wasn't.

I've managed to corral a loose group of friends into committing playing this game. Game session, due to the many factors beyond my control, will be some time in August and September.

No one's entitled to anything, except their opinions.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: Jason Morningstar</cite>For my part, I think I understand what you are asking for and I don't think it is unreasonable.

But are you telling me that there are no clear methods of design or basic principles that you all agree upon? Sure, each game may have different ways of looking at say, conflict resolution, or scene framing... but none of you can agree upon what, exactly, is scene-framing? Or, you know, conflict resolution?<br/><br/>I mean, it's not as if I'm demanding a dictionary of terms and techniques -- far from it. What I'd like to see remains the same -- a primer. Primers necessarily do not have to be comprehensive or even 100% accurate -- they just need to get the reader started.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: Ronaldo</cite>We saw just in this thread, 3 people or situations that come from outside the Indie games core, probably from traditional RPG groups and background, who say that they /us would really appreciate to see some of the recurrents terms and techniques available for referrence in a rational manner.</blockquote>\nYou know what'd be more important than a central reference, arranged in a rational manner? Just a single page, laying out the hobby in general and linking new people to important posts and ideas that drive the hobby.

There will probably be a lot of terminology hand-wringing, and editing, re-editing and the like in typical Wikipedia Warz style, but like Jason I think it's attainable and worth giving a shot.</blockquote>\nAwesome!

All I'm asking for is a place where, if one is so inclined, one can learn more about story games and what kinds of ideas story games have explored, so to speak. <br/><br/>The Wiki is a good start, but I've had the advantage of reading this thing for a few months and quietly digesting the information. I know that <cite>Dogs in the Vineyard</cite>, <cite>Primetime Adventures</cite>, <cite>Burning Wheel</cite> and a few other games loom large in this community's... shared frame, so to speak.<br/><br/>But I've got gaps in my knowledge. Basic, fundamental gaps. I didn't know what bangs and kickers were until I saw this thread (still can't exactly remember them, myself). I understand GNS is no longer considered up to date or accurate. I don't know why. I don't know what's replaced it as the dominant model for critically describing story-games, apart from the fact that it's called the Big Model. Hell, I don't even know if Chad's PDQ system is considered a story-game or not, and the reasons why.<br/><br/>Hell, I know the side effect of these gaps; I suspect I'm asking questions that I suspect have been answered before, have been argued and rehashed a thousand times. But there isn't even a measly FAQ to handle all of my stupid questions. Is there?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted by: Tyler Bachelder</cite>To those that say to just pick up and play, you've yet to take into account that some of us lack the means to facilitate play.

Now, first of all, I'm going to assume that you are both honest and correct when you say that you just can't put a group together to play anything other than D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Second, that's kind of a bummer, that you're not getting to do things that you think will be fun.<br/><br/>Third, and I know it sucks, but story games aren't and shouldn't be written with you in mind.  It's all about play.  The game is not the book - the game is what you do with the book.  Pointing to a shelf of books and saying "Pick whichever you like, play it, and talk about it," should be the perfect way of introducing story games because <i>that's what the games are for</i>.  Saying that we should have some alternate introduction for people who can't play is kind of like saying that there should be some alternate way of playing paint ball for people who are paralyzed.  It's just the nature of the beast that some people are restricted from full participation.  And seriously, I know it sucks.  I've had periods of time where my gaming was severely limited.

It's all about play.  The game is not the book - the game is what you do with the book.</blockquote>\nRight. And with some kind of Story Game Basic Set, one of the things you could do with the book is introduce brand-new people to the hobby--even if one of those brand-new people was yourself.\n<blockquote>  Pointing to a shelf of books and saying "Pick whichever you like, play it, and talk about it," should be the perfect way of introducing story games because<i>that's what the games are for</i>.  <br/></blockquote>\nI have to disagree here. Even assuming there <i>was</i> a shelf full of story games to pick from (I've spent a lot of time in gaming stores and I've never even seen <i>one</i> story game there, let alone a whole shelf full of them), how many of those are well suited to being Joe Newbie's First Game? And even if some are, how many of them are <i>actively marketed towards</i> non-gamers?<br/><br/>Now, obviously, not every game needs to be newbie-friendly and not every designer needs to have "bring new people into the hobby" as one of their goals. But it seems to me that there <i>is</i> a need for some kind of introductory game to serve as a gateway into the larger hobby--or even better, an anthology of short introductory games followed by a chapter of "if you like [<i>this</i> sample game], you might enjoy [<i>that</i> real game]."\n<blockquote>Saying that we should have some alternate introduction for people who can't play is kind of like saying that there should be some alternate way of playing paint ball for people who are paralyzed.</blockquote>\nNah, I see it more as saying that it would be nice if someone took steps to bring paintball to a wider audience by, for example, organizing games in city parks or indoor paintball ranges instead of making them drive out to someone's scary compound in the woods to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80267/#Comment_80267" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T12:03:39+00:00" title="July  9, 2007 12:03PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (I'm currently working on a <a href="http://story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=User_talk:MiSuBa" rel="nofollow">possible new version of the Story Games Codex front page</a> that takes some of this stuff forward - if anyone wants to make suggestions for improvements I'd appreciate it.

If we were suggesting a document that tried to cover all existing story-game techniques in all their conflicting technioues, than yeah, it would be an impossible goal. But, as you even term it, the idea is just to teach basic techniques that work right away.\n<blockquote>An expanded document, the excellent<i>design patterns of successful role-playing games</i>, already exists. </blockquote>\nAdmittedly, I think I last saw the document you mention while it was still a rough, but I found it unworkablely obtuse.\n<blockquote>2) A game which will introduce players of traditional games into story games ideas.

They're questions.</blockquote>\nYes, they are.<br/><br/>When a group of players makes use of these techniques to alter a game to their liking, they are altering the design of the game.  They are changing the answers to those questions.  It is important that they recognize this, and that they make any alterations with this in mind.  Because, to be plain, simply tossing in changes to one rule can have a "cascade" effect on other rules that are linked up by design and may not, at first glance, appear to be.<br/><br/>Which means that if, f'rex, a given article on "Scene Framing" decribed a stack of different ways to frame a scene, mentioning each in the context of "a game that works this way", and went on to note things that each method does and <i>doesn't</i> work well with, and why...   <br/><br/>That'd be a damn sight more useful to such folks.<br/><br/>I don't think that anyone can <i>stop</i> house-ruling from occuring, and protesting alterations to a game beyond saying <i>"look, the designer is not responsible after this point"</i> is bullshit.<br/><br/>Does that mean that I think the designer has any responsibility to <i>help</i> people house-rule in constructive and useful ways?  Absolutely not.<br/><br/>But as a form of game support, that's cool stuff.  Allowing that support to grow around a game - and even pointing it in a possibly fruitful directions - has given many well-reputed games a far more solid 'presence' than they might have otherwise had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81371/#Comment_81371" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T21:17:30+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  9:17PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2007 9:19PM by E.T.Smith.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Go for it.</blockquote>\nAlright, I finally started <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3621" rel="nofollow">Part Two</a> of this Discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3476/show-me-the-story-game-basic-set/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3476/show-me-the-story-game-basic-set">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3476/show-me-the-story-game-basic-set/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3476/show-me-the-story-game-basic-set/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3476%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3476%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
