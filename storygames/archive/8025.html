It was pretty fun! I'll give a brief overview of the fiction, and then some rules/technique highlights.<br/>\n<br/>\nA huge plane went down in the snowy mountains of South America. In it, people were strapped to the walls of the plane and that was all the plane held. Everyone was dead except for Ami, Tom, and Nathan's characters. Ami's power wasn't exactly evident at the beginning, which is cool. Tom had liquid metal arms, and Nathan heard strange thoughts. Nathan was making Tom rip off a guard's head at the beginning, and he clutched it thereafter as his "mom".<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Nathan definitely set a weird vibe up from the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmi's character quickly became the leader, and everyone went to collecting stuff for survival. She knew that they were being chased, and saw the spy plane drop coffins like bombs near their area. The chase was on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe group quickly made their way to a cave, which turned out to lead to a vent for an underground series of labs. They opened the hatch and found themselves staring at a jungle, which apparently had dinosaurs. They kept finding bodies of scientists as they proceeded onward. They eventually found Eric's character, who it was determined had a small sun in his head. Eric's character couldn't talk, and started destroying the lab he was in trying to use the computer. Eventually he made it to an elevator and everyone followed. This is when the Chasers started to catch up. The elevator started malfunctioning and Tom was able to stop it with his arms. It opened into two different levels. Eric's character went up top and the others went below. Inside were all of these vats with clones of Ami's character's sisters and cousins. The Chasers finally arrived with a mass of zombie like people following. I can't really remember how, but they were destroyed when it was revealed that Ami's character could bring dead things back to life. We then found out that the Chasers were not from this world, and these labs were the last hope for humanity. Ami was the new Eve and had to go about bringing the world back. Tom protected her, Nathan stayed, looking for the head he'd lost with the strange voices, and Eric's character was never heard from again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe decided to play that we looked like ourselves, and make the "what I look like in the mirror" be more of a "how do I not look like who I am". This was a new group to me and although we knew each other I thought it would be good to not get confused on the fiction so much if we were all different from who we looked like.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone made up three questions. I know that Ami had some trouble with these and I helped her out as best I could. She took one question that I wanted inserted into the story as her own and it ended up coloring the rest of the story. I think it might be fun for the GM to have questions out on the table that people could answer when an answer is needed, but it might not have the oomph of answering a personal question.<br/>\n<br/>\nI messed up on having the Chasers not show up in the first card until the system demanded they move forward. I think it worked out okay, but the pressure was definitely lower at the beginning. We followed Nathan's request that it all be underground.<br/>\n<br/>\nA quirk that I'd intended to be momentary (the Chasers forcing answers from corpses) ended up getting picked up by Nathan as he had them pull the corpses along. I was wanting the Chasers to be so badass that they didn't need an army, but I didn't let that get in the way. I made sure to incorporate everyone's additions as best I could.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used the Mountain Witch fishing technique a bit, but it was weird, because the fiction has the characters with amnesia. It's kind of like making up a question and answering on the spot with no dice. Still, I think it helped make the group contribute when they may have been used to the GM making up all the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may have made a big mistake not having any NPCs in the game (everyone is dead all around them - I was making sure that Ami's question "Why are we still alive?" mean something). There wasn't any interaction that wasn't between the characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou really have to be a "dick" to GM this. Make people roll every time, and I mean every time, something interesting could happen with success and failure. Don't let things ride. This will keep the pacing on board. Otherwise, people get way far ahead of the Chasers. Eric suggested that anytime someone wanted to move to a scene they should have to roll. I ended up doing all of the cards, and I treated it like a dungeon, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the only thing that Psi * Run needs is good GM and player advice. It could easily be done at this point, I think.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177378/#Comment_177378" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T08:39:53+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  8:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and I really liked the idea of having the GM assign a die if the Chasers are in the same scene as the characters.

That set everything up nicely. Everyone picked up on the nature of the ending concept and embraced it. Just like they immediately picked up on and ran with the concept that when you roll and reveal something in the middle of the game, the surrounding scene informs that revelation. They knew to make something that had just happened be meaningful.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177633/#Comment_177633" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T17:04:16+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  5:04PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris Moore, can ya tell me the idea behind giving players an extra die to use or ignore?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tomg" title="tomg"><img alt="tomg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tomgurg.googlepages.com/tinyrobot1.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tomg">tomg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177641/#Comment_177641" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T19:20:34+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  7:20PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tom here.<br>\nHere are my views on the game in general followed by comments on Mark's GMing.<br>\n<br>\nI liked this game a lot.  It took all of 20 minutes to get up and going.  I am favoring games that ask questions in character generation and this one does that with a twist - they are answered in the game.  At times by the other players.  That was very cool.  Conflict mechanic is very nice.  I like being able to assign/choose the consequences for the catagory for maximum effect or best story.  The premise is a good one.  It lends itself to a variety of stories or genres.  I liked the 'trail mechanic', the way of visualizing the chase.  It is simple, inexpensive, and effective.  <br>\nThe weirdness of our game was sweet.  Everyone was on board with it and fed off of each other to build some really fun scenes.  Eric, Ami, Nathan, and Mark made it a fantastic game.  My only regret/drawback was that I was slow getting into the game myself.  I was too passive early on.  I would like to revisit this character some time.  <br/>\nMark did a very good job with the game I thought.  He came with an idea for what he would like to see but was flexible enough to allow us to take the game where we wanted it to go.  He guided us well and contributed ideas.  I do agree with him that we should have been rolling conflicts earlier and more often.  But to his credit he was allowing us to build our story.  I appreciate that.<br/>\nNathan, Ami, and Eric are awesome to game with.  Their creativity set an atmosphere where collaboration was foremost.  It brought out some extremely fun things from us all.  One of the best was Nathan's character.  He had murdered his mother for eating his little brother and yet carried her head around with him (by proxy).  She continued to talk to him though...through the heads he acquired.  His powers increased exponentially when he was experimented on in prison.  He was able to talk to the dead and control them too.  Things got weird then.<br/>\nAll in all it was a truly fantastic game session.

Low rolls kick start the game, and, as Vincent has said about GMing this game: "Follow the low roll."<br/>\n<br/>\nMore to come,<br/>\n<br/>\nChris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177704/#Comment_177704" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T12:02:55+00:00" title="November  7, 2008 12:02PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more question, Marc and others:<br/>\n<br/>\nWas there ever a question of "who gets to go first" for a particular roll in a scene?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177712/#Comment_177712" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T13:11:47+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  1:11PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was one situation.

Sorry for the lateness and all.<br/>We just treated it as a single conflict.<br/>Eric wanted to get away(leave the elevator, along with the pilot's head), and I just didn't want him to take mother's head.<br/>So, the conflict was simply this; Eric's dude leaves the elevator along with my treasured possession(Win!), or Eric's dude leaves the elevator without the head(Lose).<br/>Eric lost the roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
