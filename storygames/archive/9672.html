You need to play with someone a long time and you need to play with them in situations that allow them to express a CA, as well as others, so they can experience it.<br/>So I'd suggest playing in situations that emphasise one particular CA for a while, then play to emphasise another CA, and then play to emphasise the third CA. Repeat a few times, and see which ones the players liked best - by asking them, and also, watching to see if their enthusiasm in play matches their description of their experience.<br/><br/>There's also the counter-question: does it matter?<br/><br/>There's a subset of gamers (me among them) that demand their play involve a specific CA. But I believe they are the minority. Many players are happy with any CA, so play that emphasises one over another will simply be "fun", whichever CA happens to be the focus at the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214869/#Comment_214869" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T12:22:40+00:00" title="June 28, 2009 12:22PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This question (and some of the answers) seem to hinge on the idea that a person and a CA are permanently connected (especially the idea that you have to watch them play for a long while). If you watched me play for a long time you would see different CAs dominate in different contexts. Certainly in Diaspora, there are very different things going on during the world building phase than in character building than in play. Even between the refresh (the first few minutes of recap and character modification) and the minutes immediately following, the CA at the table is different.

We can say that somebody enjoys a given CA, but the people for whom there is a singular identification for one and only CA are a very marginal minority, and often a socially awkward one at that. Most people can take a given activity on its own terms when those are explained honestly, and thus enjoy a wide range of CA. Even those people you often meet that refuse to play anything but D&amp;D and actively sabotage play if anybody tries anything new - I wouldn't characterize most of them as "having" a CA, but rather I'd just say that they refuse to blur their rpg cultural politics by accepting that there are different ways to play than their own. Trick them into playing some other CA either within D&amp;D or in a game they don't recognize as a roleplaying game, and it often works just fine.<br/><br/>This being said, the simplest method I use in recognizing how people approach different CA is to play different games with them, making notes of how they do with them. This usually gives me data on what people <i>don't</i> like, and even then only if the person stands out from the rest of the crew. For example, typical CA information for me comes in the form of having a really successful, clean session in a certain CA with one player who gets totally sidelined by the play because he doesn't understand what we're doing. This might indicate some other communication trouble, but it might also mean that the person outright doesn't understand the CA we demonstrated, and is unable or unwilling to participate in it.<br/><br/>In other words: insofar as a person can be said to have a CA, you might say that their CA is the one they perform in best.<br/><br/>Another viewpoint would be to ask the people themselves. Play different CA games with them and ask which they liked best. I get lots of data this way as well. The players don't actually need to understand CA or GNS here, as I was in the game with them and can thus say what the CA of the given game was. If somebody consistently ranks the narrativist games above gamist ones, for example, then that's a pretty clear sign that the player has a preference. Most people have this sort of slight preferences, I've found. They are only semi-permanent and tend to shift through time, as opportunities in different CA come up. For example, D&amp;D 4th edition has caused a global increase in gamist priorities, as people are excited by the new gamist possibilities the game has to offer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214873/#Comment_214873" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T12:34:34+00:00" title="June 28, 2009 12:34PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: if you played with me and tried to find a CA for me by observing the sort of play I enjoy, you'd probably just get confused about what CA even means. This is simply because my CA is different in different games, as happens for most people who know how to follow a given game's instructions over their own universal rpg theory. So when I play D&amp;D, it's gamist, and when I play TSoY, it's narrativist.

CA is only perceived in how people interact, so an individual's CA preference can really only be deducted by asking them or observing how they <i>don't</i> fit in with a group. If they're fitting in what the group is doing, then you can just say that they are playing along with the group's CA, but what does that say about "their own" CA?<br/><br/>When we play and the CA is working, I have a constant feeling that I am communicating in a pertinent and active manner with the other player(s). My part in play is not just a rote participation, but it pushes an envelope actively, and the other players can see that and nod, smile and otherwise react to what I'm doing. In other words: a functional group CA is recognized as coherent communication of the purpose of play. When we're not coherent, I feel like I'm talking to a wall: my cues get missed and the other player gives input I can't work with. And even if I can work with it, I know myself that I'm just twisting their intent around to make it fit my own desires in the game.<br/><br/>As you can see from above, recognizing the CA when play is on-going is pretty easy if you're one of the players, because you can check what your own internal agenda is and then look at your social contact with the others and judge whether they're getting enjoyment out of the same thing you are. Through the last years I've had increasingly less trouble with recognizing the CA because I've become a more methodical and purposeful roleplayer; I don't usually go into a game without having a clear systemic model for what the game is supposed to do and how. Understanding this model in the abstract makes it trivial to recognize the GNS mode as well.<br/><br/>If I'm external to the play and just observing it from outside, then I need to empathize with the players and basically try to understand their focus from outside the communication loop, just by observing the signs. This is still possible, especially if you trust that you understand the general thrust of what the players are doing. It's not that difficult to notice whether somebody is having fun and contributing in a relevant way in a 4th edition D&amp;D session, for example.<br/><br/>(In any case note that I'm not discussing a single moment of play here: I'm observing the processes players engage in during the game, not individual choices, so there is always plenty of history that comes before a given moment and makes the reactions, interaction and initiatives the players take understandable. I don't have to observe an entire reward cycle if I already have a good guess as to what is going on, note; for example, in all CoC play I've seen there have basically been three different CAs, so I just need to observe enough to distinguish between those to have a pretty good guess as to what is going in the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214880/#Comment_214880" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T13:38:37+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  1:38PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I just realized that I only discussed coherent play above. You can observe individual CA signs in incoherent play by looking at what the players are <i>trying</i> to do. It's a bit of a hit or miss situation when you don't see the initiatives pan out successfully, but observe long enough and have a good enough model to back your theory, and you might get a pretty decent picture of what the player is up to. For example, it's even a bit of a cliche that a player who goes combat-crazy in a railroaded adventure might be looking for meaningful challenges to beat; it's not a given, but if you have prior knowledge of the usual interpretations of a given game, the local play culture, the personality of the player in question and so on, then you might be able to empathise and make a guess as to what the player's CA would look like if it were functioning properly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214885/#Comment_214885" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T14:07:33+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  2:07PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2009 2:08PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really intrigued by the way people play <i>World of Warcraft</i> differently - given what it is, and the limitations of the medium, I'd say it doesn't actually support Story Now, as there's almost no dynamic, long-lasting input that is meaningful in that regard. <br/><br/>Eero, I really like this thought of yours: <i>You can observe individual CA signs in incoherent play by looking at what the players are trying to do</i>. <br/><br/>With that idea in mind, I can express what I'm talking about with WoW - folks who are primarily into getting the best gear possible, PVPing, and so on could be pursuing Step On Up goals; folks who are mostly into taking in all the scenery, finding cool spots to take screen-shots, and *maybe* folks who like to "RP" could be pursuing Right to Dream goals; folks like me, who eat up the fluff like none other and try to riff on the themes introduced or implied by said fluff, and then desperately wish the game was affected more permanently by completed quests - - I know that for me at least that's a yearning for Story Now play.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that, yes, while everybody is into this stuff to some degree, you run into folks who really can't be arsed to do at least one of those broad "paths" - hardcore PVPers and folks who grind for epic gear seem, in my experience, to not really care about RPing at all, see quests only as transactions, and usually ignore the scenery entirely unless something really cool is happening, like a Guild spelling words with their bodies. I, for instance, enjoy having better gear, but have little to no interest in doing much to get it if it means I have to deviate from exploring the "storyline"; an old Guild buddy of mine will occasionally comment on the differences in tone in said storyline, but he's a classic raid/gear/PVP type in everything else.<br/><br/>EDIT: I phrased things carefully here; social priorities are a different kettle of fish entirely, as they are not aesthetic ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214886/#Comment_214886" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T14:12:58+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  2:12PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2009 2:15PM by Graham.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>As you can see from above, recognizing the CA when play is on-going is pretty easy if you're one of the players, because you can check what your own internal agenda is and then look at your social contact with the others and judge whether they're getting enjoyment out of the same thing you are.</blockquote>\nBut, aaaargh.

So, your question is out of scope. You don't have moments where people "are Gamist" or "use Gamism". You have a pattern of everyone at the table encouraging and elevating challenge and risk above other aesthetic elements in the game, and that is Gamist.<br/><br/>At a particular time, what you have is someone either a.) having a positive, supporting reaction to someone else showing guts and acumen in the face of risk, or b.) showing guts and acumen in the face of risk and seeking positive, supporting reactions, subtly or overtly depending on their social tendencies. This is not Gamist play, but as a trend in an individual player's behavior, it's probably an expressed desire for Gamist play.<br/><br/>If it helps, using any creative agenda term as a noun is confusing, I think. I prefer to use them as adjectives only as often as I can, most often modifying the words "emphasis", "priority", "play", "support", or "wanker".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214894/#Comment_214894" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T14:30:21+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  2:30PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All right, Leonard.

For example, in Poison'd you can usually recognize Narrativism when a player decides that his character can't stand another character anymore due to what he did. Sparks tend to fly at that moment of value judgment. That's a turning point for the game's reward cycle, so that's where we see the CA in action most clearly.<br/><br/>Recognizing functional Simulationism is more difficult, but it's that simply because there aren't very many coherent sim games. This doesn't mean that there isn't coherent sim play, but it does mean that people have very different rules sets and play practices in mind when they think of simulationism. For example, in <i>Dead of Night</i> (one of those rare coherent sim games) I see the sim very clearly when the GM adjudicates the tension chips and decides to bring in some content based on their number: it's a pleasurable point of contact between the rules and the GM's imagination, one where everybody gets to appreciate how the player in question interprets the rules into the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214913/#Comment_214913" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-28T15:34:22+00:00" title="June 28, 2009  3:34PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2009 3:38PM by Graham.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I'm confused.

I told you to play with a group "for a long time" to understand their creative agenda, with the assumption that they would play the same game with the same CA, and you would have needed that time to (1) simply get to know them - it's not always easy to understand a person you don't know, and (2) to see and entire cycle of play to start to end (that for some games is a lot of time)<br/><br/>At no time I suggested, I think, that people play with only a CA or that a single person can have a CA.  A Creative Agenda is something AN ENTIRE GROUP has, for the entire duration of a cycle of play. If there isn't a common CA, there isn't a CA, period.  You don' have a game where X has a CA and Y ha another, you only have an incoherent game.

You're playing coherently if the actions of the other players seem purposeful and fun to you while they also respond with affirmation to your actions, pretty much.<br/><br/>You identify the GNS mode of your play in a coherent group by analyzing your own experience of the play: what was it that you enjoyed in the game yourself? What were the elements that the whole group clearly appreciated and took to consideration in their interaction? If these were challenge-based, then it's Gamism. If the play was about theme, then it is Narrativism. If it was about letting the experience play out with consensual imagining, then it was Simulationist. Think back on what actually was the core content of play and what it was that your group enjoyed about the experience.<br/><br/>Vincent has said something pretty smart about this: most people can't really understand the different GNS modes without actually experiencing them in play. So it's possible that unless you've experienced the different sorts of play, you can't categorize your own play effectively simply for the lack of context. Play analysis isn't the simplest of things anyway, as you need to be able to look at what happens and notice the pertinent things over the inconsequential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214988/#Comment_214988" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T02:41:47+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  2:41AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 2:44AM by Graham.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>If the play was about theme, then it is Narrativism.

To the people who says that they have all three in their games: In mine, too. In EVERYBODY'S games. But I have a clear sense, when these things conflicts, of what "has priority"<br/><br/>Look at what you (plural, as a group) consider (even implicitly) as more important, what is the center of the game, and what happen on the sidelines, what happen during the climax of a game and what happen during the intervals to take a breath.   <br/><br/>It's a priority that has to be seen during the entire (bigger) cycle of play.  For example, in my old D&amp;D games, people passed entire sessions simply enjoying their character, role-playing and making silly things. But it wasn't a "moment with a different CA", it was a moment to take a breath between dungeons. It wasn't ever in discussion that the game was about fighting and winning.

This does not imply incherence GNS-wise, it just means that the group is exploring the fiction. Exploration does not come in the way of premise-addressing, because they happen in different parts of the process: typically you'd first explore the fiction to find out interesting nuances, and only then start addressing premise, being informed of those nuances.<br/><br/>What would make the exploration into real simulationism would be if the premise-addressing were not validated when it's time came. This is really quite easy to see in that a player addressing premise with his choices is making a moral decision, while a player enforcing the dream derives his choices from established genre or story facts. For example, he might decide that because we saw earlier that the character is stingy, he'll be stingy now as well. A premise-addressing player will be more likely to choose against prior indications because that makes for a clearer statement. All situational, of course, but that's often how you distinguish sim vs. nar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214996/#Comment_214996" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T05:41:48+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  5:41AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So it's possible that Graham's group may empirically demonstrate play that's 40% N, 40% S, 10% G, and 10% unrecognizable, right? In which case N and S have equal priority. Doesn't Forge theory already allow for the possibility of "mixed" Creative Agenda? I seem to recall such a thing being possible, and relatively uncontroversial.

So I'll grant you that it's possible that "there is in every moment the desire to show your worth as a player, the enjoyment of the game world, and some sort of theme," at the level of the individual player, it's not relevant to determining the CA of a group, which emerges as a product of the group's demonstrated behavior.<br/><br/>Certainly that's what I take away from this comment:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>CA is not a function of "presence": it's a function of "priority"  (so, I disagree with Guy's post above)<br/><br/>If you take a long cycle of play (and CA is observed in the longest in a game), you'll have moments where you'll play to win a conflict, moment's where you'll explore a premise, etc. etc: ALL these are pleasurable things, that happen often in rpgs. To the people who says that they have all three in their games: In mine, too. In EVERYBODY'S games. But I have a clear sense, when these things conflicts, of what "has priority"<br/><br/>Look at what you (plural, as a group) consider (even implicitly) as more important, what is the center of the game, and what happen on the sidelines, what happen during the climax of a game and what happen during the intervals to take a breath.</blockquote>\nIt seems unreasonable and not a little dogmatic to insist that one and only one Agenda must take priority in every play group, but perhaps I misunderstand your point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215002/#Comment_215002" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T06:28:28+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  6:28AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2009 6:33AM by Graham.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But, Moreno, that example is available to us.

GNS modes are not about individual feelings, but rather about the focused attention of the group itself. Each of the items on Steve's list can happen in any agenda mode. For example, caring about outcomes - in a gamist game you care about an outcome because you're invested in it as a challenge, but that doesn't mean you don't care about the outcomes in other modes; you might well care about the outcome because of your sympathy towards the protagonist character (a major issue in <i>Zombie Cinema</i>), for example.<br/><br/>As for whether GNS agendae can mix - you don't see an agenda mix in a single game session (or at least a single united communication situation; a session could shift gears in the middle, but that'd break the currently on-going reward cycle) simply because the agenda requires coherent play from the players to manifest at all. If you're not playing towards the same agenda, chances are that your agenda will only be instantiated as failed overtures towards getting it off the ground. This doesn't mean that you can't switch agendas as a person or as a group, but I've never witnessed this "40% narrativist" phenomenon myself; I don't in fact understand how it could happen, as the agenda modes are discrete units. It makes as little sense as would an aeroplane that was 40% bicycle.<br/><br/>Concerning Graham's original question, I do admit that it's not simple to answer this if you want unambiguous and mechanical guidelines. Roleplaying is so very rich and varied a phenomenon that the best I can do is give advice about recognizing the CA in individual games. For example, I could make a guess that if players are planning to blow up monsters in Call of Cthulhu and they prepare accordingly, then it's probably the gamist variety of the game that you have going; blowing up monsters, and especially explicitly and concernedly preparing to do that, doesn't really play a role in the very different sim variant CoC which assumes that the players are going to enjoy playing characters who are basically clueless as to the dangers they're going to encounter. Player activity, the mechanical points of contact and reward cycle stress points are so different in different games that I can't off-hand give any better advice than trying to understand what the players think that they are doing while playing, and seeing if those understandings match into a coherent communication between the players. If it does, then you have a CA in the group, and you can look into the psychological satisfaction that is served by that CA - which in turn tells you which GNS mode that CA represents. It's abstract, but barring a concrete game system to reflect on (and one I know pretty well, to boot), that's pretty much the best I can do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215097/#Comment_215097" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T12:31:16+00:00" title="June 29, 2009 12:31PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are we talking about the CA at work in the game as it progresses, or the CA <i>preference </i>of the individual player?  <br/>I feel like I'm hearing people talk about both interchangeably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215101/#Comment_215101" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T12:45:44+00:00" title="June 29, 2009 12:45PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I understand it, we started from the preference, but are currently hashing how to even notice CA in action.

While one could indeed <i>develop </i>a CA <i>preference</i> (which would not necessarily map neatly to one of the big 3 CA "nodes") after much experimenting with different CAs in action, for most players of games CA ought to be a hat that they wear, different from time to time, to harmonize with the people they're gaming with and the system they're using and everything... Everybody's preferred CA should be "any, as long as there's one".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215119/#Comment_215119" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T13:58:50+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  1:58PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>A standardized CA assessment tool that people could download and administer to each other or to their groups would be handy, even if it's not perfect.

I promised myself I'd stay out of this.<br/><br/>These never work because people are terrible at evaluating their own CAs from surface details.  I have a friend who swears that all she really wants to do is imagine her cool character doing cool stunts and stuff.  Except, that when you actually watch what she's doing she (a) loads up her characters with issues and (b) doesn't engage unless those issues are in play and her "cool character doing cool stuff" is in some way hitting those issues.  Based on surface level self-evaluation she claims she's a Right To Dream preference player but a Big Model savey external observer can tell she's as hard-core Story Now as they come.<br/><br/>I have similarly met people who are all about "the story."  Everything they talk about is about "the story."  But in play it is observed that by "about the story" they mean "conforms to the expected pre-play assumptions about what THIS story is "supposed" to be about/like."  Based on surface level self-evaluation they claim they're a Story Now preference player but based on external observations they're clearly Right To Dream preference players.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215125/#Comment_215125" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-29T14:21:03+00:00" title="June 29, 2009  2:21PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please, please, please... enough of these "what's my CA?" for Eris' sake.<br/><br/>When I'm in a group to play (coherently) Agon or DnD4E, that group (and that game) will have a Step On Up CA<br/>When I'm in a group to play (coherently) DitV that group (and that game) will have a Story Now CA<br/><br/>...or not, and the game will be incoherent.

Between Bill_White's podcast and the related discussions to identifying instances of GNS, I learned quite a bit about the connection between theory and actual play.  I've been hammering out the kinks out of my group's play and I was getting hung up on things related to what falls into which creative agenda.  Now I see that the way forward for getting the kind of play I want is to concentrate on the actual expressions of the elements of exploration.  I don't need to categorize those expressions in order to look at the actual behaviours of play that produce them.<br/><br/>This discussion was very timely for me.  I'm starting to think that Ron Edward's presentation of the Big Model in 2003 is better than his later amendments of it.  The major difference being that Creative Agenda (aesthetic priorities of the players) was defined as being the expression of elements of exploration through techniques rather than being the skewer that affixes every part of play together (including social contract issues that are entirely outside of creative agenda).<br/><br/>PS.  Just read Play Unsafe.  Awesome stuff.  After I read it I pulled my copy of Impro off the shelf.

When, usually, almost every group played always with the same CA, even with different games (if a game doesn't push or provoke a specific CA, as in the case of most traditional rpgs, there is no push to change gameplay), identifying incoherence and CA clash was a good way to solve many problems.  (and still is, for most of gamers "out there" who never played a coherent game)<br/><br/>With coherent games, changing CA is as changing game: today one, tomorrow another. It's for this reason that for THIS crowd, it isn't so important anymore IN PLAY. But it's become much more important in design, because you can't handwave the question anymore with a "these rules are only suggestion, if they don't work change them"

the CA of an instance of play.<br/><br/>At the end of the instance of play, look at what people said and did and how the group reacted to them. Find those things that the group rewarded with praise, affirmation, and collaboration. If there was a kind of synergy among the group regarding a certain class of things, you probably have a creative agenda. <br/><br/>Which one? Well, if those things tended to prioritize _performance with risk_ (see <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/21/" rel="nofollow">Gamism: Step on Up</a>), then you have a Gamist instance of play. If those things tended to prioritize _delving into problematic issues during play_ (see <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/narr_essay.html" rel="nofollow">Narrativism: Story Now</a>), then you have a Narrativist instance of play. If those things tended to prioritize _celebration of source material_ or _"getting it right"_, (see <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/15/" rel="nofollow">Simulationism: The Right to Dream</a>), then you have a Simulationist instance of play.<br/><br/>If those things tended not to prioritize any of those things, then you don't have G, N, or S (but maybe you have some other creative agenda; people have suggested Immersionism as a possible fourth option, though it strikes me as a technical agenda, not a creative agenda). If those things tended not to prioritize anything at all, then you probably don't even have a creative agenda present in the instance of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215314/#Comment_215314" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T08:23:27+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  8:23AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hypothesis:<br/><br/>There's a reason the official fall-back position of the theory has always* been that you don't categorize players, just play.<br/><br/>There's also a reason why categorizing any traditional game took "hundreds of hours of play" over "multiple groups" by only a few qualified experts and we still never got an answer on Hero system.<br/><br/>It's kinda like like <a href="http://www.steorn.com/orbo/" rel="nofollow">the Orbo!</a>: if you nailed it down people might decide it didn't work!<br/><br/>[ Note: unlike the Orbo, self-reporting, although traditionally unpopular in theory dialog, <i>is</i> reasonably good if you can ever agree on terms.

It's so easily falsifiable. I have, at different times in different play sessions, prioritized what I'd call Gamism, Narrativism, and Simulationism. You can't categorize me as one of those three things, because I like them all at different times. Maybe you can say, in this game, Adam was a Narrativist, but that only makes sense to me if you mean "Adam was trying to make the game session Narrativist," and that's a redefinition of the creative agenda.<br/><br/>Categorizing games (rather than sessions of games) is likewise not useful, because it's long been held that you can play any set of rules any way you want. Some ways for certain groups might be more fun than other ways. You could spend hundreds of hours with multiple groups playing Hero System and never get a good answer, though you might learn that people tended to play a certain way and have fun more that way. Doesn't say a damned thing about what CA the game "is."<br/><br/>All that's left to categorize is the instance of play. That's not a fall-back position. It's the evolved position, as far as I can tell. The earlier essays like "GNS and Other Matters..." did talk about categorizing players, player goals, and (to a lesser extent) games. This was abandoned over years (a decade?) of discussion because it didn't hold up, which is all you can wish of any developing theory.<br/><br/>That is, it <i>didn't</i> work, so they changed it.

Everybody having had a great time + strong agreement about all of the above is an indicator of coherence: go on.<br/><br/>2) Examine AP reports and your own memories looking for the critical points when making a different choice would possibly have "ruined" the game for you and everybody involved but (possibly) the chooser.

Which was most important, looking back at the entire instance of play? What was rewarded the most? What got people arguing or exclaiming "yes!"? What in play made people wince and go, "oooh...." Was escaping important because you felt your characters wanted to survive, because survival was part of the essence of the world you were playing in? That just sounds like a setting/situation/character thing. Or was it really about using all your resources to beat the fucking GM, who was using all of his own resources to stop you from escaping? Was it AWESOME that the GM battled it out with the players, and one side emerged victorious? Would it have been awesome if the GM had stopped you all (and was it awesome because the GM had proved he had better skillz than the players)? Or was the real fun--the real payoff--involved in creating this twisted Cthulhu asylum setting, setting up a dangerous situation for the characters, and seeing what happened?

Making points about important questions of humanity? You can tell they were the most important because these are the things that got affirmed and rewarded by other players. <br><br>Here are some /potential/ "tells" for Sim vs. Gam. How often did exploitation of the rules trump in-game reality? That might suggest a Gamist CA if exploiting the rules was considered good and clever and was regularly rewarded by the group with applause, groans of "aw, man, you got me there!" and so on. Or was it the opposite, with in-game reality sometimes trumping the rules? How often did the group (or GM) agree to ignore a rule or fudge a die because it didn't make sense for the game? "Getting it right" ("it" being the setting, the character, the situation, etc.) at expense of the rules is a potential Sim tell.<br><br>Now, you will often see both kinds of tells in a game. Hell, you'll see Narr tells, too. But if you look at a complete play instance, you might see a pattern where one of those seems to be prioritized /by the entire group/.

That's a creative agenda. <br><br>If you don't see that kind of alignment, you probably don't have a creative agenda. Or you have different players competing for different creative agendas and thus no creative agenda. If the light scatters in different directions, it's incoherent light. It still might be bright.

I don't necessarily even believe everything in The Big Model. I agree with most of what I have said here, though.

You do stuff. <br/>2. You are rewarded by the game (which is not necessarily the CA payoff I am talking about). <br/>3. You start doing stuff again. It's more or less a repetition of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, only with new stuff (and it can't be new stuff until #2).<br/><br/>The cycle of play is #1-#2, starting a new one at <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.<br/><br/>So for D&amp;D 4E:<br/><br/>1. You explore some place, maybe talk to some people, then you fight monsters and limp home to rest.<br/>2. You do this until you gain enough XP to level up.<br/>3. Now that you're higher level, repeat <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but with more dangerous monsters.<br/><br/>I can measure that instance of play in 4E without knowing anything about creative agenda. Everyone gets the "leveling up" bit as the cycle of play.<br/><br/>For Sorcerer:<br/><br/>1. You write a Kicker. You role-play stuff about that Kicker and demons make your life miserable.<br/>2. Eventually, you resolve that Kicker in the fiction. I think you get a stat bump or something.<br/>3. ...and you're allowed to write a new Kicker and start playing again.<br/><br/>I can measure that instance of play in Sorcerer without knowing anything about creative agenda. Everyone gets the "write a new Kicker" bit as the cycle of play.<br/><br/>What does a complete cycle of play look like for JAGS? Something like this?<br/><br/>1. Play for a while, earn XP or something like that.<br/>2. Between play sessions, maybe between scenes, spend XP and improve the character.<br/>3. Play more.<br/><br/>I don't think the CA payoff is tied up in that cycle. An instance of play might not even have a CA payoff. This payoff I am talking about is the group getting all jazzed about stuff everyone did.<br/><br/>You could totally play Sorcerer as a Gamist thing. If all the players were focusing on using the game rules to beat each other down without any real regard for what point they were trying to make, and they all got hot and bothered about the competitive or challenge elements of it, it could conceivably be a Gamist instance of play. <br/><br/>I think the "instance of play" thing is just a minimum amount of play to examine so you don't mistake excitement over techniques as the CA or miss some crucial part of play in evaluating CA. If you were to watch only the preamble bar scene in a D&amp;D game, you might get the impression it was not a Gamist game. But watch players optimize their characters for combat and then watch them use those optimizations in combat to earn XP so they can level up and optimize for stronger creatures, and watch the players /really get into doing those things/, and you realize that the bar RP was not really relevant to the main priority of the game, which was kicking ass and testing the character build and getting to the next level. Is bar RP fun? Seems to be! Was it the main priority of play?

You can only measure instances of play if you know the CA.<br/></blockquote>\nI'd say that those two are inextricably observed together. To perceive a CA in practice you have to first observe human behavior at the game table, then construct a theory of the mind to explain it ("those people are having fun because of this and that"), and only then can you affirm your theory by further observation. In other words, you have to first observe to find a potential reward cycle, after which you can put the CA to words, after which you can do further observation to affirm your theory. That first observation, however, is necessarily arbitrarily based on your own play experiences and understanding of human nature - you have to project your own experiences on what you see and try to imagine what the players are doing.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is what trips Graham up - we can't really do direct observation of what goes on in other people's heads, so we have to interpret their social signs, which in turn has to be done on the basis of our own internal models of what <i>could</i> be going on. It's pretty difficult to build a model of order out of the chaos of continuous human interaction if you don't have the first inkling of what could be happening, which interactions are pertinent and which are just noise for your purposes. Knowing that people usually want to gain more xp for their D&amp;D characters helps immensely in this, for example, as you can reflect this prior experience against what you're seeing in practice. That might help you affirm a reward cycle that seems to be happening in the game, which in turn tells you about the CA.<br/><br/>To put it even more conscisely: you can't observe the CA, you can only observe instances of play. If you can spot the reward cycles in those instances, you can classify the rewards in GNS terms to arrive at a CA mode. There is no circularity because reward cycles are not defined by the CA you want to observe; you have to observe when people are rewarded and describe the CA in those terms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215428/#Comment_215428" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T11:58:40+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 11:58AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simple solution.

You will have to provide a detailed description of play and he may ask you lots of questions and it may take 2 or 3 pages of posts but if you really want to work it out he will probably work it out with you.

You are rewarded by the game (which is not necessarily the CA payoff I am talking about).<br/>3. You start doing stuff again. It's more or less a repetition of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, only with new stuff (and it can't be new stuff until #2).<br/><br/>The cycle of play is #1-#2, starting a new one at <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.<br/><br/>So for D&amp;D 4E:<br/><br/>1. You explore some place, maybe talk to some people, then you fight monsters and limp home to rest.<br/>2. You do this until you gain enough XP to level up.<br/>3. Now that you're higher level, repeat <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but with more dangerous monsters.<br/><br/><b>I can measure that instance of play in 4E without knowing anything about creative agenda. Everyone gets the "leveling up" bit as the cycle of play.</b><br/></blockquote>\nThis relates "instance of play" to the mechanical reward system which is (most people think) related--but not the same thing (that is: going up in level isn't the same as completing an instance of play--certainly getting extra dice isn't the pay-off in DitV, for example--nor even may completing a town be).<br/><br/>So if we are using the term "Instance of play" to just mean: enough of the game that it's indicative then okay--not circular--but certainly not necessarily enough to measure CA since a single dungeon in a fantasy game would let you see enough to know what the game was like--and people could even level up--but there could be (and often is) a lot more going on. Yes?<br/><br/>So I think there are two separate usages here.<br/><br/>I took a look at the glossary which defines Instance of play as:\n<blockquote>Sufficient time spent on role-playing necessary to identify all features of System in operation. According to the Big Model, once these features are identified and evaluated in terms of a given group?s Social Contract, then Creative Agenda (or its absence) may also be identified. In practice, an Instance of play is rarely shorter than a full session, and may be much longer.</blockquote>\nI think that 'all features,' 'in operation,' and 'in terms of a given group's Social Contract' are probably all sufficiently nuanced that multiple meanings could be derived.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215442/#Comment_215442" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T12:38:59+00:00" title="June 30, 2009 12:38PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>To put it even more conscisely: you can't observe the CA, you can only observe instances of play.

"Reward cycle" is better, as it pretty much defines the necessary time-span for observing CA in its name already - to observe CA, you need to observe the structural buildup and release of value a given game provides to its players. In most games this takes over fifteen minutes, say, but it's rarely more than one session in the games I play nowadays. You can read "instance of play" as an earlier, more vague term for the same thing if you want.<br/><br/>(Not my idea, this term - I picked it up at the Forge a couple of years ago, I think.)<br/><br/>Couple of simple examples of reward cycles:\n<ul>\n<li>In 4th edition D&amp;D the basic reward cycle concerns winning a battle: it starts when the combat encounter is defined by the GM, and ends when the tension is released around the end, at the moment when everybody sees what the outcome will be. I'd say that the great majority of how a 4th ed. D&amp;D experience pans out depends on what role this combat subgame plays in the group's toolbox. I would be slightly surprised by a 4th edition group whose CA I couldn't observe from when, why and how they set up and resolve combats.</li>\n<li>In an advocation-based narrativist game, like Dogs in the Vineyard, Shadow of Yesterday or Zombie Cinema, to name a few, a basic reward cycle concerns reveal of information, choice situations caused by the revealed conditions, and the consequences of those choices. This basic model creates a dramatic arc; the way an individual game sets up and handles these cycles contributes much to its basic nature. The length of the process varies: in Dogs it's pretty much by definition (caused by the town creation rules) one session per 1-3 arcs, in TSoY it can range from 3 per session to one per three sessions (usually in the quicker end at my table, but I've read of groups who play a much more textured and leisurely game), while in Zombie Cinema it's one per fifteen minutes of play if the players are doing their job. You can see functional narrativism very clearly in these games if you know to observe the existence and functioning of this model; the games tend to fail if these reward cycles do not happen for some reason, as they are the designed main content for those games.</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215464/#Comment_215464" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T13:12:03+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  1:12PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marco</cite>Your initial example to which I replied said:<br/>Let's say it took two sessions for you to play out the asylum escape from start to finish -- that sounds like a complete instance of play.</blockquote>\nThis doesn't reference going up levels or getting Xp or anything related to mechanics.

As far as I understand what Ron and others have said, you should be asking, "What behaviors are the players observably rewarding and affirming?" For example, I take a big risk in D&amp;D 4E and I roll well and it saves the whole party, and everyone including the DM shout in excitement because that moment was awesome, my risk-taking was awesome, and so on.<br/>\n<blockquote>This usage is circular: The way I know if the asylum break-out was enough to measure a CA by is if a CA was measurable.

In fact, I think I explicitly said the opposite.<br/><br/>You know it's an instance of play when you've basically played out the main parts of the game, especially the reward system (not the social payoff). Are you telling me that you don't see D&amp;D's explore-fight-level cycle as an instance of play? Or Sorcerer's Kicker-play-resolve cycle? Because if it seems obvious that those are instances of play, then maybe you can describe how you know they are instances of play better than I have described.<br/><br/>I mean, you can argue with the nuances of the definitions of terms in the Glossary's definition of "instance of play," but I think you get what they mean. I think a reasonable person gets what it means. I don't think there's <i>that much</i> disagreement with it when you start talking particulars. I do think that defining it can be tricky.

In many games they even align with reward cycles, such as in Dogs in the Vineyard. This is likely a very fruitful area of study, one on which I might have a thing or two to say myself. As can be seen above, my understanding (or opinion, depending on how monolithic you think "Forge theory" is) is that nobody has really shown how mechanical cycles of a game align with its reward cycles. The D&amp;D level-up is actually a really good counter-example and food for thought in this regard, as it's pretty obvious at least in my experience that the level-up is not a reward in the CA sense; it's a movement to a new crunch environment and enjoyable because of how it promises new things (new powers, new challenges) in the future, but it's not the psychological reward claimed by GNS. I can imagine ways of playing D&amp;D in which level-up were the goal of the reward cycle, but it's not usual by any means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_215487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215487/#Comment_215487" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T13:53:37+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  1:53PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me the way to identify if a cycle has reached its natural completion would be: If we'd stop the game NOW, right NOW and change game entirely... would you feel it was an interrupted game? Or would you think "ok, maybe the story isn't over yet, but it's a nice stopping point"?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the first case you already got at least one full cycle. In the second case you want more, so clearly you were not rewarded. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nEmpirical, but is it dumb?<br/>\n<br/>\nA complete reward cycle for DnD4 IMO still depends heavily on how the game is played, and who is playing (4E is not *that* focused). I could imagine for example the completion of a full Tier (Paragon, and the others that I can't remember) to be a probable "complete instance of play". This is not necessarily syncronized to "a full campaign" or "a level".<br/>\n<br/>\nFor other games it's easier, especially if they have an endgame. The "instance of play" is simply "a full game, start to finish".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_215490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/215490/#Comment_215490" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-30T14:03:32+00:00" title="June 30, 2009  2:03PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my problem with the shit I said up there. Assume you're playing 4E in a nonstandard way and you and your friends are really getting off on address of premise in the game. Will you see that in the instance of play I described? Will you see that in what seems to jazz the players between the start of 1st level and the time you level to 2nd?  Fuck, will you even see that between the time you start a combat and kill the damned owlbear? <br><br>If not, you could argue that it wasn't an instance of play in the first place. Maybe it takes longer to address premise and see the payoff. <br><br>This is the essence of Marco's argument and he has a great point.
