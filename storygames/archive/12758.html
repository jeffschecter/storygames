I don't have any experience with White Wolf games save picking up a copy of Changeling: The Lost and reading it with thoughts towards either hacking it or using some of its elements for other games.  I wasn't doing as much role-playing in the 90s and vampires and werewolves have rarely held much appeal for me.<br/><br/>I haven't bought it yet but I was thumbing though a copy of Geist and felt there were a lot of cool ideas in it in terms of color &amp; setting.  It occurred to me that I've had a lot of ghosts or ghost-like hauntings in most of my recent gaming.  Love in the Time of Sei\xf0.  Apocalypse World.  S/lay w/Me.  All with ghosts, spirits, unquiet dead.<br/><br/>If you have read it, are you aware of any influence on any games you've read or designed, either directly or from some the sources that it draws upon?<br/><br/>Even if you haven't read it, do you like/use ghosts in your games?  What about ghosts appeals to you, why do you think they're interesting?<br/><br/>I have some personal regrets.  Some of the characters I play are pretty regretful.  I think the idea of spirits appeals to a sense in me that it would be nice if it were true that it's never too late for second chances.  Plot devices around ghosts suggest that possibilty in an unusual and entertaining context.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286852/#Comment_286852" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T17:27:23+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  5:27PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't recall using ghosts, ever. It just didn't happen. I recall reading through Wraith and Orpheus way back when, and enjoyed the read. Hunter too. For ghosts from the external point of view.<br/><br/>Ghosts tend to be very emotional and passionate beings. There are ghosts full of regrets, who just float around and moan their despair. And there are angry ghosts that fling things around and scares the hell out of people.<br/><br/>Is there such a thing as a happy ghost? Besides Casper? And he wasn't even that happy to begin with... I suppose there are mischievous ghosts in folklore, so it's possible, I guess.<br/><br/>Ghosts tend to lose their grip on their identity over time. They forget who they are. They are still angry or sorrowful, they just can't seem to remember why.<br/><br/>Ghosts need to move on, but usually can't. Often for the very reason they are so angry/sad. And since they have only a limited effect on the mortal world, they need to enlist their help... If they even realize what needs to be done. And sometimes, they are scared of moving on (just like sometimes kids are scared of growing up) and try to sabotage other's effort to resolve whatever keeps them from leaving.<br/><br/>Yes, I would love to play a ghost story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286854/#Comment_286854" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T17:44:58+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  5:44PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the ghost story is probably in many ways my favorite genre to GM, and I've had some omdest success.

I don't have any familiarity with the actual Wraith game but there was a GHOST/ECHO hack that someone did that was suggestive of Wraith that is intriguing to me.  That Wraith: The Great War book is of particular interest and I hadn't heard of it.  Christian (xenopulse) ran a PTA game for our group set in WWI, and inspired primarily by Carnivale.  I remember now that it too had an important ghost, "The Lady of the Trenches".<br/><br/>I don't really want to play "ghost stories" as such, and I have a hard time imagining an enthralling game where all the PCs play ghosts.  I just like them in my games as devices and am looking for good ways to use them, (some of which I'm sure I can get from RPG objects that have ghosts at their center).<br/><br/>Ghosts are cool because they are both high and low status.  They are needy, having at least one need and they are incapable of fulfilling that need themselves.  But players and characters often feel a certain deference to them whether from natural respect for the dead, fear of some potential curse, or because they seem invulnerable to all of the standard levers one might apply to an NPC.  <br/><br/>Ghosts often know things too.  They are ancient historians and they may also act as oracles.  As with Apocalypse World's psychic maelstrom, they can be used by the GM to communicate things to players that might otherwise be impossible to know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286955/#Comment_286955" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T10:41:30+00:00" title="August 17, 2010 10:41AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2010 10:42AM by fnord3125.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geist is pretty cool.

Starting from death really did, in my opinion, give the game hope.  You don't have to worry about keeping yourself alive any longer; now you can focus on what's REALLY important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287602/#Comment_287602" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T13:29:01+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  1:29PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the stated theme in the second edition was "Spitting in Oblivion's Eye" the idea was that your character was saying "I exist, no matter what you say." Which is a pretty powerful thing when everything in the environment wants to see you undone. Pretty neat take on being a ghost, imo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287829/#Comment_287829" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T09:46:36+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  9:46AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geist is... OK. The book is written in the standard White Wolf style, where they don't explain everything but explain the utter hell out of other bits, leaving you somewhere between dying of thirst and drowning. The setting is cool, and the ideas are great, but if the core ideas (powerful ghosts with unfinished business bonding with humans at the moment of death and becoming something more; beings empowered to abuse or lay to rest the unquiet echoes of the dead) had been pushed front-and-centre and given a Story First! treatment, it would've been much more powerful.<br/><br/>As it stands, it might be worth a read for setting material, and then just hacking the themes for Solar System or Dresden Files. In fact, I think the DFRPG is quickly going to replace ALL of the White Wold books on my shelves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
