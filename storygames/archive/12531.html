You could create a 4-to-a-page flier for the awards... encouraging people to vote for the people's choice award, and attend the award ceremonies*.<br/><br/>*obviously, that would require you know where and when the ceremonies are.<br/><br/>Then, you could upload the 1-page PDF to this thread. Then, someone who works in a big office could print off 500 without their boss flipping out.<br/><br/>Ryan Macklin could promote it every day on This Just In... From Gencon. Including a live podcast from the award ceremonies.<br/><br/>Every blogger could blog about the awards coming up.<br/>Every podcaster could podcast it.<br/><br/>People working booths could say "Hey, did you know that tomorrow at 5, that game you're holding might win an award?

But, of course, note the "NW" in that title.<br/>It'd be great at Camp Nerdly, for the same reasons (small con, hub of indie designers and gamers), and suck for the same reason (too regional).<br/><br/>Most of the ideal conventions are pretty regional.<br/>In North America, it seems like some good conventions to hold the awards at are: Gencon, Dreamation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_281623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281623/#Comment_281623" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-19T09:13:35+00:00" title="July 19, 2010  9:13AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to blag about this!

I doubt I could run to seven of them.<br/><br/>[EDIT] It's not that I'm unwilling to give my time, it's just I don't have any money and I wouldn't feel good about offering a sub-standard trophy.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284225/#Comment_284225" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T21:12:32+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  9:12PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2010 9:13PM by jhkim.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A quick update here.

Rather than have them be just another thing that happens in a sea of other festivities, why not make the awards ceremony the marquee event of a smaller con? Not only would that call more attention to them as This Important Thing That Is Happening, it would also serve to boost the importance of that smaller con, I would think.</blockquote>\nWhile this is cool, it brings up a complicated question: what con?<br/><br/>See, it'd be great at Go Play NW, a hub of indie designers and gamers. But, of course, note the "NW" in that title.<br/>It'd be great at Camp Nerdly, for the same reasons (small con, hub of indie designers and gamers), and suck for the same reason (too regional).<br/><br/>Most of the ideal conventions are pretty regional.<br/>In North America, it seems like some good conventions to hold the awards at are: Gencon, Dreamation.<br/><br/>I think Lester's right.<br/><br/>And Joe: what con is <i>not</i> regional?

The Day After Ragnarok won the Indie RPG Award  for Best Supplement, and the Gold ENnie for Best Setting. I expected neither of those to happen, and I am hugely gratified by the two very different signals, both alike in dignity, sent by those awards. [...] Before I leave this paragraph, I'd like to apologize to the Indie RPG Award folks for missing the ceremony -- after last year's un-ceremonious award, I'd dropped the event off my radar, and I further never imagined that my very, very trad game book -- published by someone else, for two rulesets (so far) I didn't design -- was even eligible, to say nothing of imagining it could win. So I'm baffled, surprised, and very pleased and grateful.</blockquote>\nI confess that I didn't even think of this before reading that doubt expressed in that quote. I know that the definition of "Indie" of the Indie RPG Award is much more "open" than the one used at the Forge or elsewhere, so I simply assumed that that supplement was Indie by that definition, that Ken Hite was self-publishing it or something like that.<br/><br/>But after reading that "published by someone else", I wanted to check the definition of "indie" for the Award.<br/><br/>From the <a href="http://www.rpg-awards.com/license.shtml" rel="nofollow">Quinck And Dirty Guide To Gaming Licenses</a> in the award's site:\n<blockquote>Pinnacle's Savaged License  \tIneligible since games must be approved by Pinnacle.</blockquote>\nSo, I would like to know from someone what is the case:<br/>1) That supplement was published with another, different, license, that make it eligible for the award.<br/>2) That supplement was not eligible for the award.<br/>3) That page on the award site is wrong and should be modified (so that any other publisher of Savage World's supplements can register next year, without being mislead from that page)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286431/#Comment_286431" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T10:16:15+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 10:16AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, that part of the FAQ is from over six years ago and I should update it.  <br/><br/>Basically, part of Ken's comments are off-base.  Being traditional and/or being a supplement for rulesets you didn't design do not at all disqualify an entry from the awards.  For example, Thou Art But a Warrior is also for someone else's ruleset.  <br/><br/>The licensing part is more tricky.  Notably, there were some complaints regarding Mouse Guard winning last year.  Both Mark Smylie's Archaia Press and Luke Crane had won Indie RPG awards in the past with no complaints, but some people felt that the collaboration meant that the result was no longer independent.  As a result, for this year, I left it up to the voters rather than trying to make my own judgments for each entry.  I put instructions with the voting that if any voter had an issue with an entry, they should speak up <b>before</b> the results were announced.  <br/><br/>I think I will revise the FAQ to no longer be absolute.  The problem is this - Most RPG small press and independent press basically consist of one author helped by their friends and/or family.  What I really would not want is to absolutely disqualify collaborations - where one author publishes with the help of another.  For example, the RPGirl Zine was also a collaboration of authors, and prospective authors had to make submissions which were judged for inclusion.  <br/><br/>As for The Day After Ragnarok...  Ken Hite has self-published before, and has been on the Indie RPG Award voter list since before I took over the awards.  Pinnacle as far as I know is the design house of author Shane Lacy Hensley.  The question is whether this should be considered a collaboration or a non-independent work-for-hire.  I'm not sure how I'll do it in the future, but for this year, we decided by none of the voters objecting to its indie-ness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286440/#Comment_286440" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T11:27:04+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 11:27AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2010 11:29AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Point of note: Ken owns copyright/IP on DAR.

The problem is that it's considered too restrictive by a lot of people, but the same people can't agree to a common different definition that isn't maddening vague.<br/><br/>Talking about that...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>First of all, that part of the FAQ is from over six years ago and I should update it.</blockquote>\n[...]\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>The licensing part is more tricky.  Notably, there were some complaints regarding Mouse Guard winning last year.  Both Mark Smylie's Archaia Press and Luke Crane had won Indie RPG awards in the past with no complaints, but some people felt that the collaboration meant that the result was no longer independent.  As a result, for this year, I left it up to the voters rather than trying to make my own judgments for each entry.  I put instructions with the voting that if any voter had an issue with an entry, they should speak up<b>before</b>the results were announced.</blockquote>\nThanks for clarifying this, John, but I see this as a TERRIBLE way to judge if a game is eligible or not.<br/><br/>Without clear guidelines, without any real rule for being eligible apart from "nobody has issue with the inclusion", don't you see that it become a "my friends can participate, the people I don't like... I will have issue with!"  kind of award? The very same thing that it was (falsely) accused to be at the beginning by the usual forge-haters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286464/#Comment_286464" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T12:59:05+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 12:59PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough, Moreno.  The FAQ should definitely be updated.  <br/><br/>The thing is that there are many RPG books that are clearly non-independent.  An amateur author submits a work on spec, or a professional author is paid up front - and their copyright is then owned by the company they submitted to, who edit and publish it as they see fit.  <br/><br/>Conversely, there are authors who completely make and sell their product on their own.  <br/><br/>Even though there is a huge grey area between these two, I think the distinction is still very important - and gets at the vitally important principle of creator control.  The problem is that creator control isn't something that is obvious just from the packaging of a product, and I don't want to have to do investigative work on every entry to the awards to find out the contract they were written under.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
