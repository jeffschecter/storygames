My "theme" was more present in the music than in the lyrics. That meant the big jumps in tone were saved for the times when we switched playlists and not in the middle of scenes. Last time I had a list that kept a common lyrical theme, but could swing from soft to speedy, which was a bit jarring when it happened in a slow scene. I did allow for more gradual changes, though. My theme was "Turn on, Tune in, Drop out", and it started happy, went to soft and smooth, and ended up trippy. These were slow changes that crept into the narrative instead of forcing itself in.<br/><br/>I also used more instrumental music. Don't know if this made it better. The music is supposed to be front and center, but the narrative tends to take over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin" title="Colin"><img alt="Colin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin">Colin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453388/#Comment_453388" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-19T16:55:15+00:00" title="May 19, 2016  4:55PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an approach that makes sense!

Like, because of my general tastes I tend to put a lot of hard rock &amp; metal in, but I've usually tried to temper that with some classical, or softer styles of rock or even pop I wouldn't quite care for out context, etc.<br/><br/>However, I too have generally tried to avoid any abrupt "jumps": what I strive for is for a piece to follow into the next without too much of a gap, despite their differences. It's helpful that quite a number of rock, metal or classical pieces are quite varied themselves, with intros or endings which may be faster or slower than their mid-sections, for example, or having their own arc with solos and tempo changes etc. So my ideal approach is to select candidate tracks first, based on my title/theme but with an eye toward variety, and then choose how to arrange them based on their beginnings and endings so that the transitions are as soft as possible.<br/><br/>Because of the rules, the above doesn't really apply to the first two tracks, though, which need be chosen for their lyrics. I didn't use to pay much attention to that, but I've come to think that one's choice of the <i>third</i> track (i.e. potentially the first in the first scene, after setup) might be quite important.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X" title="Charlie_X"><img alt="Charlie_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/513/nSBLNVCY6RNQO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie_X">Charlie_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453593/#Comment_453593" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-27T15:06:48+00:00" title="May 27, 2016  3:06PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It really depends on what you want to do with the theme. One of my group went for angry poppy revenge tracks, mainly as a lot of albums she'd been listening to had them. Another went for weird German music mixed with old radio reports. I went for a rough Riot Grrl theme and realised there were things out of that wheelhouse I wanted as they just sounded like good driving tracks, so I called mine "Asphalt Riot" and had done with it.<br/><br/>One I have lined up at the moment I wanted to start calm, escalate and then calm down again, to see what would happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
