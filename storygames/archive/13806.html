(Bear with me here.) The idea that not only does every character in the game have a definitive moral stance, but that you can<i>actually use magic to detect what that code is</i>colors the game more deeply than you might think. If you ask a bunch of people "what makes this game great", pretty much no one will yell out "the alignment system", but I think it is a big part of it. I'm not entirely sure how, though</blockquote>\nAnd then Jamie said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>And Detect Evil is great if you just want to play a game where you kill monsters with no moral ambiguity.  They needed killin'.  (They nerfed this in Pathfinder, interestingly - you can't detect alignment on low level characters.  It's like, "Look, how cute, he's trying to be evil, but he's such a n00b it doesn't show up on my evil detector." - we actually had some good moral-arguing-banter-roleplay in my last Pathfinder campaign.)</blockquote>\nI really want to hear more about this.<br/><br/>I've played a lot of D&amp;D, and I can't remember a single instance, ever, when alignments enhanced our gaming. The only times they ever even made sense was when they helped us reimagine characters (e.g. "What does it mean that your character is Neutral Evil?" "Well, what I really mean is that he is selfish, and doesn't see the world in terms of black and white, but rather in shades of grey." "Oh, OK, cool."). So I suppose that merely posing the question ("Is your character good or evil? Lawful or Chaotic?") puts you in a position to consider your character in a way you might not normally ever ponder. (Who among us ever wonders, walking through life, "Am I good or evil? Is that grocery store attendant good or evil?" "Good" and "evil" are rarely seen as personal identities, but more often assigned as descriptions of acts and choices.)<br/><br/>For my groups, dealing with Evil alignments among the "heroes" was particularly problematic. What does it mean to be evil? If I am evil, do I think of myself that way? (If detection magic has ever been used on you, how do you <i>feel</i> about discovering you are "evil"? That must be bizarre.) How can I, as a player, portray my character being evil without just, say, engaging in random violence or spoiling the game for everyone (D&amp;D was rarely a good game for PvP play, as it generally assumes a team of heroes working together)? And so on. Problematic.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>In this thread, please tell us about a time when D&amp;D alignments or something very similar (you know what I mean) made for some Truly Great Gaming, or elevated your game to something better than it would have been in their absence. Surprising events, revelations, unusual scenarios?<br/><br/>How can alignments awesome-ify a game? (You can also share some stories of how alignments really ruined a game, but if you do it had better be <i>really really entertaining</i>.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312537/#Comment_312537" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T16:06:11+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  4:06PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I only like lawful evil in theory, because whenever I've asked a group if I could play it ("So, like, I take joy in human suffering, but I honor contracts, am honest, keep my promises ... so you'll know you can trust me, but it'll be letter-of-the-law type trust ...") they've said no.<br/><br/>So ...

If the bandits registered evil we probably would have slain them without mercy.<br/><br/>That said - we were all various stripes of 'good' - if there had been no alignment system at all, we probably wouldn't have been arguing. The exact circumstance was we had a contract with the local king to execute unrepentant bandits by sword or rope - so the lawful good guy was like, "Let's fulfill our charter and execute them painlessly" whereas the chaotic good guys were split, maybe we should take them prisoner, and somebody then said, "Well, what if they repent?" And so we ended up herding dozens of 'repentant' bandits back to town, some of which turned into loyal NPCs and others of which started trouble.

The paladin or cleric just _says_ "trust me, that person is evil, kill them." And why do you believe that guy? Because he's lawful good? How do you know he's lawful good? Because he says so, and he's part of some well recognized religion which says "this is what's right and wrong, we're lawful good, trust us."<br/><br/>If everyone had Detect Evil / Know Alignment it would be one thing.

Even in our current game, the evil girl is acting nice, the neutral guy is a bastard...it just doesn't click. Remember that chart where Batman is ALL alignments? Yeah.<br/><br/>The first time alignment made any sense to me was when I realized it's not (or rather wasn't) supposed to be a morality system at all. It's about <i>which powers you're aligned with</i>. Whose side are you on? Chaos-Neutral/Unaligned-Law. Just remember this game was in part inspired by Elric. I like James Maliszewski's interpretation and largely agree with it: Law is the side of human order, the universe makes sense, we want to survive it it.

They're more like a slew of individuals with various levels of skill coming together for a mission, possibly with rival parties out and about working at cross-purposes. From session to session, composition of any party can change up.<br/><br/>And this is more or less drawn from an earlier "Ideal" wargaming situation: An ongoing campaign game with multiple factions ( played by different individuals) with roughly the breakdown of: Coalition A, Coalition B, and a whole bunch of individual singular factions who might swing either way or even switch up depending upon how the play progresses and how much members of either coalition can bribe/threaten/browbeat them.<br/><br/>( Anyone who wants to natter on with me about that last bit, or just ask why that's so doubleplus awesome in a wargame context, just whisper me and we'll start a new thread. People tend to talk about the wargaming roots of rpgs only in the context of mechanics and overlook the influence of techniques.)<br/><br/>As an answer to the original question, it's all about those Neutrals of various shades, and occaisonally about those guys who bite the bullet and flip from Coalition A to Coalition B and the opposite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera" title="XanatosChimera"><img alt="XanatosChimera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera">XanatosChimera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312679/#Comment_312679" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T12:05:56+00:00" title="February 15, 2011 12:05PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2011 12:07PM by XanatosChimera.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It did kind make me wonder about the world where the good aligned heroes could commit genocide and still be considered good in D&amp;D.

If alignment's not supposed to matter -- if folks everywhere are just folks, tryin' to get by -- then it's counterproductive to make any more than a small fraction of them Good or Evil, and certainly entire races/civilizations/cities shouldn't have any particular alignment at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312716/#Comment_312716" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T14:19:08+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  2:19PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>It's all in the setup, I think.

I don't really get the argument that we don't need alignment then.<br/><br/>Either that or don't make it "complex views of the world" but simply two warring sides (the original alignment axis, before Arduin spoiled it).

TNG had one episode where the society seemed idellic and utopian and so forth, but there was only one penalty for ANY transgression: death.  It was the same if you accidentally stepped on grass with a "do not step on" sign, or in this case white board or if you murdered an orphan and her fluffy bunny and then made goblets and utensils out of their skulls and bones.<br/><br/>This could arguably be a Lawful Evil society.  The point I was getting at was they didn't see themselves as Evil.  The only time it was termed evil was by the outsiders on the TNG crew who had run afoul of the unknown law.  Similarly, the orcs are commonly termed evil because they rob and/or kill others, but encountering a band of orcs in an adventure usually leads to the characters attacking first and killing them and stealing their loot. the only difference is that the character sheets say X-good or neutral on them while all orcs are automatically X-evil. Even the farmers.  4e did generally address this by adding the "Unaligned" alignment.  But they did also caricature the other outlooks... again the aligment really seemed to be a judgement from the player character point of view. Arguably the Raven Queen's philosophy could be termed evil as well.<br/><br/>And the Lawful Good PC is still lawful good after masscaring a band of over-matched kobolds instead of just knocking them out and tying them up or just scaring them off and leaving them be.  The same action by a group of NPCs puts them under the X-evil set of alignments but the PCs are not seen as such for the same actions.  Even robbers who don't kill their victims are termed evil, but the PCs who massacre them are good even though the PCs could have simply captured them, and brought them back for trial and a prison term for example (or execution by torture) which was relegated to evil by Enlightenment thinkers.  The thing is that the dark-ages society didn't see torturing someone to death as evil.  Theft was evil from the point of view of the shopkeeper who lost a loaf of bread, but not seen as evil from the point of view of the starving person who stole it.<br/><br/>A band of ragged, ill-equipped and poor kobolds are robbing people just to survive and get rich, PCs routinely massacre, grave-rob etc also to get richer and more powerful... sometimes they take out a lich or dragon in the process of this as well.  I just think that it's a little odd to assign the same alignment to a band of robbers as to a character like Halaster or Szass Tam.  Halaster traps and tortures people just for the hell of it (he's also insane, so one might ask if he is actually criminally responsible for his actions)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312752/#Comment_312752" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T17:25:39+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  5:25PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2011 5:26PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>I think the point might be that cartoonish is alright, when it comes to wizards who are hurling meteors at orcs.</blockquote>\nBasically, yeah.  I mean, there's precious little in your typical D&amp;D setting that makes any damn sense at all -- from big things like gods and magic to little things like castle walls, it's chock full of unrealistic fantasy stuff.  It's a great backdrop for a particular kind of fun that is not seeking to hold a mirror up to the real world.<br/><br/><br/>In practice, our local games of D&amp;D have mostly either minimized alignments entirely (to the point where they're just generalized statements about worldviews with no particular game impact), or used them exclusively as talking points for party setup and in-character conflicts ("no evil characters in this party," CG and LG characters have a lot they can discuss in most situations, etc.).<br/><br/>Probably the most interesting setup we did was the one where everyone chose a single patron deity at character creation.  You shared that god's alignment, and your moral compass was basically "What would my god want me to do?"  The other gods existed and did all the usual D&amp;D god stuff, sure, but only <i>your god</i> cared about <i>you</i>.  Detect spells and alignment-based magic all worked normally, but we would drag everything back to the bottom line of who you worshiped, and how faithful you were in that worship.

The same action by a group of NPCs puts them under the X-evil set of alignments but the PCs are not seen as such for the same actions. Even robbers who don't kill their victims are termed evil, but the PCs who massacre them are good even though the PCs could have simply captured them, and brought them back for trial and a prison term for example (or execution by torture) which was relegated to evil by Enlightenment thinkers. The thing is that the dark-ages society didn't see torturing someone to death as evil. Theft was evil from the point of view of the shopkeeper who lost a loaf of bread, but not seen as evil from the point of view of the starving person who stole it.</blockquote>\nI have never played a D&amp;D game where slaughter was an acceptable course of action for a good PC. Killing and fighting yes, but your fighting against people who are fighting back. Stabbing people in the back, killing enemies who surrender, etc... were things that very few PC would ever do. If you're using alignment scales (a la Dragonlance) there's no way in hell you wouldn't slide towards Evil and Chaos if you killed a surrendered enemy. Sturm Brightblade or Human Dragonbane would risk there lives in order to take the super-evil Ogres of Krynn captive if they refused to fight. That's why those Lawful Good character's interesting, they put meaningful and dangerous restraints on their own behavior.<br/><br/>This may be my bias, but Dragonlance seems like D&amp;D  par excellence and the aligned organizations in that game never stop being interesting to me. The evil characters are evil, but not, in my mind cartoonish, just exaggerated in the same way everything else about D&amp;D is exaggeration.<br/><br/>It seems to me like most people look at alignments and choose to use them only in the extreme, and never imagine that they can be nuanced. The very idea of Chaotic Good to me, or Lawful Evil is very nuanced... I can name excellent well rendered characters from dozens forms of fiction that still fit well into the alignment system, espescially when thinking of characters from fairy tales, myths and pulp fantasy that D&amp;D uses as its source of inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312779/#Comment_312779" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T23:09:39+00:00" title="February 15, 2011 11:09PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot of this sort of misses the point about alignments being something detectable in-game.

What I somewhat obliquely was saying is that because alignment was this arbitrary and external concept that does not sync with how we as people view ourselves (in that we tend to believe that people can change, that how you act is a choice, that making good choices about how you act makes you a good person) the construct of alignment in D20/D&amp;D is broken as designed. I mean, even disregarding the many subjective interpretations of "good" behavior, the idea that there's one and only one True good way to act is preposterous on its face. Nor does it address arguments of situational ethics.<br/><br/>I think the idea that the word "Evil" means nothing except what some spell tells you seems to run counter to how the concept is presented in most incarnations of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I suspect we're on the same page with this discussion, but wanted to address any confusion I might've added with how I presented my opinion on the matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calithena" title="Calithena"><img alt="Calithena" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calithena">Calithena</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312808/#Comment_312808" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T06:00:53+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  6:00AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2011 6:02AM by Calithena.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main functions of alignment in D&amp;D; as I've seen them:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Lawful Good - gives the player a license to be moralistic and the DM a license to demand that the player do things with his character. (The latter, less so, also for 'good'.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Chaotic anything, Evil anything, or even True Neutral - gives the player a license to fuck over the other players by betraying, robbing, abandoning, and/or killing their PCs when it suits him or her.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Occasionally, alignment can be used as a vector for moral dilemmas, particularly the good 'corner' alignments, but really any of them work. This is like (1b) but softer and more interesting - 'you are lawful and good - your king is asking you to assassinate someone secretly'; 'you are chaotic and good; your people can have peace, but only if they agree to leave the woods and settle in the village' type stuff. This requires player cooperation, though, and often these dilemmas will be just as persuasive (or not) to any player regardless of his or her character's alignment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a huge fan of D&amp;D; but I don't think alignment particularly contributes to play in most cases, and there are some instances where I think it contributes unproductively. That said, it's a way of categorizing people that intrigues non-gamers quite a bit - it's one of the few RPG mechanics that has infiltrated ordinary discourse in the broader culture.

The "pitch" in D&amp;D does tend to start explaining alignment as a player choice for a character, and give examples of alignment using actions characters take; however, if the goal is to somehow understand how alignment actually works in a game world, this is a horrible place to start. Instead, given that the system comes with things like detect alignment spells, understanding <i>must</i> start by answering the question "what is it that spells like detect alignment are detecting"?<br><br/>How you choose to answer this question for your game makes a fundamental, if subtle, difference in the whole game world.<br/><br/>In one game I played in, the idea was that since detect alignment was usually a devine spell, the answer it gave was filtered through the world-view of the god that gave it. Thus, any in-game discussion didn't involve words like "lawful evil", but rather "how righteous you were in the eyes of Thor". Similarly, spells like protection from evil or dispel evil used the same filtering concept.<br/><br/>In another game, alignment was viewed as an "intrinsic nature" that you were born with and trapped in, and the spells detected this; however, because spells like detect alignment exist, basically <i>everyone</i> knew of this "intrinsic nature trap" as a proven fact and a good deal of the background story of the game world involved various factions and forces seeking a way to break out of the trap. It led to invasions, wars, flimsy justification, and so on. This game, naturally, required a good deal of buy-in from the players in order to play within their trap.<br/><br/>You could argue that the "start by deciding why detect alignment works" approach is more of a house rule sort of thing. Maybe. On the other hand, the mere existence of spells like detect alignment and protection from evil in the game leads inevitably to this question sooner or later, so seems to me to be clearly part of the rules, though not a very well explained part.<br/><br/>To my mind, if you have ever created a campaign world where you didn't answer this question, then your campaign world is incomplete. The fact that most published campaign worlds don't answer this question is really no excuse.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312832/#Comment_312832" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T08:14:05+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  8:14AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I can't shake this impression that Alignment has something to do with political rhetoric (American, of course, because D&amp;D is American).

I like this angle.</blockquote>\nReading this whole thread, it's pretty clear that my whole approach in this area is different than most people's.<br/><br/>Seems like the standard approach is "We like our game world to be a certain way. The alignment rules conflict with that way, so we ignore most of them and hand-wave the rest. The fun is playing in the world we want to play in."<br/><br/>I always thought the point was "given that the alignment system exists in the world, what divergence does that require the game world to have that our world does not? The fun is in fleshing that out and playing with the ramifications in that world."

So what you're saying is that the justification for Alignment is that it's D&amp;D. Okay, that's kind of what I'm saying too. It's a legacy item that conveniently jibes with the way a lot of Americans think about war and violence.<br/><br/>That's not at all a circular argument. All I said was: the examples you give are not of D&amp;D, while what we are discussing is D&amp;D. If our discussion is about "alignment" as an idea outside of dungeoncrawling fantasy adventure games, we can keep on talking about how stupid and unrealistic it is and try to make it into more statements about broad cultures.<br/><br/>D&amp;D is, from the text, a game about going into evil places, killing evil things, and taking their treasure. This includes wizards hurling meteors at orcs. Within that framework, alignment works fine, and makes as much sense as the wizard, the meteor, or the orc.<br/><br/>You say that alignment makes D&amp;D cartoony like it's a bad thing. Alignment certainly isn't the only thing that makes D&amp;D cartoony, and that's a great thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312940/#Comment_312940" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T14:45:37+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  2:45PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had fun with alignment a couple times.<br/><br/>Once, I played a cleric of Shiva. I was focused on the dual nature of Shiva - Creation/Destruction, Man/Woman, etc. My character was unable to get his head completely around that dual nature and basically ended up with a split personality. But it split along racial lines. So my character was Good toward humans, but Evil toward demihumans (he particularly hated halfers, like centaurs and satyrs and mer and such). So if you used a Detect Evil on him, your answer would depend on who you were - I used the alignment system as a mechanical reinforcement of my character's pathological racism. We had one person playing a half-elf in the party when I played. So as a player, I talked with her about it outside of game and got her buy in to be gunning for her character - I made sure she was well stocked with magical healing and such, so she wouldn't be relying on my character to serve his party role toward her during game. During the game, there was an encounter where we ended up needing to perform some sort of sacrifice in order to move on. I got the monster to eat the half-elf's finger as the sacrifice (she suffered a semi-permanent -1 to damage or something like that). That was a perfect win for me and my character - cause grief to the hated half-elf without being a total jerkface out of game and making the other players hate me. Good times. And I think having the good/evil duality be present in the game let to that interesting character concept, which I don't think I would have thought about otherwise. That being said, it was a rare instance of alignments actually being interesting. And I was customizing the general mechanic a bit to achieve it.<br/><br/>More recently, I spent over a year playing a Lawful Evil character in a LARP campaign. In that world, there's no detection spells and you don't have to have an alignment or anything. But the campaign world grew out of an old tabletop D&amp;D campaign, so the faction I made the character in was created as an example of a Lawful Evil concept. The faction was a knightly order known as the Shadowblades. And the cool thing about them is that they have a well justified semi-good-guy-ness to them - one of the primary goals of the order is to fight demons. However, they do so in a "by any means necessary" sort of way - but not quite "any means" because he held a few things to be much closer to inviolate than the general player base. I created the character on purpose to throw a little more PvP conflict into the game, but, again, without being a total jerkface. Part of the fun was in the fact that, as you guys have been describing, a lot of the players were playing "whatever we do is right cause we're the good guys" style. So my character would call them on their shenanigans. If they made a deal with an NPC and then broke it because they decided he was a bad guy so their word didn't matter, I'd call them on that. If they got annoyed with an NPC that they were trying to get information from and started torturing them, I'd call them on that. I didn't believe in torture - I took prisoners for very specific purposes. If I was going to offer a prisoner an opportunity to earn their freedom by giving up information, I would do just that - I'd let them know how things were and then ask questions - If I got satisfying answers, I let them go and if not, I'd kill them. If I wanted to take prisoners in order to do an army to army prisoner exchange, then I did that. But torture was unacceptable. But some things that were considered culturally unacceptable in the world, I did. Like using necromancy to raise the corpses of my enemies to fight other enemies - I had no problem doing that - in fact I was saving lives by doing so. I had tons of fun playing a character with a bizarre sense of morality who felt 100% justified about his actions. He even had some good-guy tendencies, but those were tempered with a bizarre twist. For example, he would throw himself into danger in a way that looked very much like a heroic good guy. But if you asked him why he was willing to put himself into such dangerous situations, he would explain that everyone else was obviously too incompetent to handle such a situation, so he had to do it himself. One of my goals with the character was to make people like him, but feel bad about themselves for liking him. And he accomplished that goal admirably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312946/#Comment_312946" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T15:45:56+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  3:45PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite><br/>I mean, next we're going to say that D&amp;D bears a Randian<i>Greed is good</i>message because you get XP for gold, disregard laws and kick peasants?</blockquote>\nI have said before that D&amp;D presents an implicitly petit-bourgeois view of the world, a world of small businesses and self-made entrepreneurs.

The players were diplomats on behalf of a green dragon (colors of scales had nothing to do with alignment in this game world and bigger monsters were often rulers over kingdoms).  They had made a pact with the drow empress whose expansive empire was beneath the Green Lady's forests and were escorting a drow assassin to go kill their enemy.<br/><br/>A paladin came across them, did the ole Detect Evil and saw the drow, glowing like a beacon of evil but the diplomat/adventurers weren't having it.  They ditched the paladin NPC and went on their way.<br/><br/>The paladin came back later, while they were sleeping, cut down their assassin and whooped on them.  They killed the bastard and were really, really pissed off.<br/><br/>Honestly, looking back, we were playing the wrong game for that campaign.  D&amp;D 3.0 just isn't an optimal choice for the kind of morally gray diplomatic cloak and dagger fantasy power playing we were looking for.  This was one of many indications that we had the wrong game books in front of us but, looking back, it was interesting how upset they were.<br/><br/>"A holy knight would never do that!"<br/><br/>Folks were pissed off.<br/><br/>Ah, alignment.<br/><br/>As I said in the thread quoted above, I like the idea that there are these ideals, these places and deities and beings who are wells filled with good, evil, law and chaos but what I like even more is that the players are trying to sort through this shit in the mud, trying to figure out what it all means while dealing with monsters and shit in a complicated world built on these kinda crazy not-reallly-human moral compass points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312961/#Comment_312961" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T16:21:12+00:00" title="February 16, 2011  4:21PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>Sure, but at that level it's superfluous too.

I basically want to write "GOOD GUY" all over, this is the core idea of the character. Alignment does that. The fact that I'm a good guy is actually a thing, on my character sheet, and a fact that other people conclusively know about me. If I want to play a person trying to be good, there's another game for that (it's called Burning Wheel).<br/><br/>Alignment establishes D&amp;D as a world of moral absolutism. There's good guys and bad guys, and we know which one we are.<br/><br/>No, alignment doesn't make sense, but neither do a lot of things in D&amp;D.

Is she driven by hatred or some other dark emotion? And then we had races that, culturally, tended to be motivated by their darker urges.

If the guy you said was Neutral Good kills the bad guy you were "suppose" to question after it surrenders, than ha! now your evil -15% XP or whatever.<br/><br/>Good and a "a good guy" are not one in the same. Paladins can be assholes in the sense that you wouldn't want to be their friends, but they can't be assholes in the sense that they would assassinate a sleeping enemy based on the use of Detect Evil... not without ceasing to have access to their paladin powers (if your going by MY understanding of RAW).<br/><br/>Can't remember the exact source but some 2e book strongly advises having evil guys just hanging out and being normal once in a while. You could be friends with someone who was evil, or even love them (once again, going back to Dragonlance, the relationship between Caramon and Raistlin and the rest of the companions seems to fit very much into the world of D&amp;D alignments and I think it makes for good dramatic content. Once agian this also underlies alignment change, Raistlin begins with self-avowed neutrality and becomes evil over time. Despite being evil, he works with good forces because their ultimate agendas ally themselves against a common enemy).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312993/#Comment_312993" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-16T23:54:59+00:00" title="February 16, 2011 11:54PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: philaros</cite>Hey Jeff, would you please bow out of this discussion and start a new thread if you want to talk about "how D&amp;D alignment is stupid and perpetuates the evils of the modern American society"?</blockquote>\nWell, shit, if people would just accept my extremely cogent points without arguing, there'd be no problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313026/#Comment_313026" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T08:01:53+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  8:01AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2011 8:12AM by sage.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for indulging the sidebar, but it has made me think about how Alignment has made for awesome gaming: it's kind of flagging what the game isn't about.<br/><br/>I've played plenty of games where 'Chaotic Good' was a lot like more explicit flagging, along the lines of Beliefs. Alignments are not meant to be challenged like beliefs, they're a way of communicating what the game is explicitly not about. The way that alignment has made my gaming more awesome is by removing a potential fruitful void to focus on what the game is about.<br/><br/>Writing down Chaotic Good specifically says you don't want to worry about law, just kick some evil ass, and have the people praise you for it. Lawful Evil says you want a hierarchy of evil you can climb, inspiring more fear and hatred along the way. It's an explicit way of communicating interests and assumptions.<br/><br/>It's actually a great, sneaky way of communicating what the game's about without creating a lot of background. I don't have to explain that my fighter stands up for the weak by freeing the slaves of the evil empire of Kara'urh, or that my barbarian fights for the Redclaw Clan to drive off the demons of the dark woods. I can just say "Neutral Good" or "Chaotic Good" and get on with it. In a game where one of the most reasonable opening scenes is your characters outside the entrance to an undergound treasure trove, that's a powerful shortcut.<br/><br/>It's also an explicit fantasy tag, telling you this is a fantasy game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313029/#Comment_313029" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-17T08:27:38+00:00" title="February 17, 2011  8:27AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2011 8:32AM by Wordman.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Like many other rules in D&amp;D, it's a lot of fun to start with "this is the way the world works" and then try to extrapolate <i>what else must be true</i>.<a id="Item_53" name="Item_53"></a></blockquote>\nYes.

The player, being familiar with AD&amp;D assumed Lawful Good, and when the Drow who had ambushed them, and previously taken a High-elf Prisoner (but not killed, interestingly enough), surrendered, the player realised that he couldn't go through with killing.<br/><br/>Ostensibly the benefit of alignment is that in a game where the primary mechanical means of interaction is combat, and for which the reward is XP, having a mechanic that imposes an XP penalty is a good way to encourage alternative courses of action. Now, you could probably get the exact same result with a well thought out social combat mechanic, or even the direction 2E was going with giving rewards for completion of quests, as well as acting in character, and de-emphasising combat rewards. <br/><br/>It makes sense really, the game gets interesting as you acquire new powers, and you acquire new powers by leveling up, which comes by way of XP, which explicitly comes by way of killing. Obviously you'll be looking at killing things as a primary course of action, so you need something to encourage alternate courses of action. Alignment encourages non-combat actions by way of discouraging combat in certain situations. Where it falls apart though is leaving the option for non-Good alignments. Once you're neutral, killing becomes a pretty viable option, and people would go for chaotic neutral simply because they could act based on mechanical benefit and not have their alignment conflict. It essentially became the metagaming alignment, and unless you played someone insane, wouldn't really lead to any roleplaying.<br/><br/>Probably much more interesting would be to have each character with a code of ethics, and Dragonlance 5th Age went this direction by having nature and demeanor (and mechanically encouraging "good" type natures and demeanors by having them on the low numbered cards. Having a list of things you must do or must not do provides some good roleplaying constraints, and doesn't lead to the kinds of (out of game) arguments alignment leads to. In game are certainly quite possible, and barring planescape it probably works out better. It's also what Palladium/RIFTS did, which definitely confirms that's how people around the time were using alignment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera" title="XanatosChimera"><img alt="XanatosChimera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera">XanatosChimera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313397/#Comment_313397" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-19T19:15:31+00:00" title="February 19, 2011  7:15PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've heard that the Alignments worked well with Planescape.

The alignment is also tied to your soul, your soul goes to the appropriate alignment plane when you die, so someone LE has their soul going to the 9 Hells, where they'll be converted into low level Baatezu and eventually work their way up, someone CE will have their soul going to the Abyss and become a Tanaari. Some of the alignment planes produce some very interesting creatures and events, such as the LN plane, Mechanus, being home to the Modrons - mechanical creatures that are perfectly lawful, who for some reason on a regular basis go on a rampage throughout the planes.<br/><br/>Planescape also had factions, all associated with alignments, so naturally when you /align/ with a /faction/, alignment starts making a lot more sense.<br/><br/>As a side effect, if you're at all aware of Planescape cosmology, it works very well in every campaign setting except for Dark Sun and Ravenloft. In both settings alignment is largely meaningless, as in the former you're cut off from all the planes, except for ethereal, and in the latter everything is tainted by evil, and you're never leaving it anyway (if Vecna can't get out, your soul certainly isn't leaving once you die). Krynn is also a bit odd, given that it has some specific laws as far as time travel and magic go, making it something of a hybrid in terms of aplicability of Planescape cosmology.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_313411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313411/#Comment_313411" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-20T01:22:56+00:00" title="February 20, 2011  1:22AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forgotten Realms also draws on it quite well, everyone worships a deity, and you'd have to have an alignment that's only one step removed, so you've already got your primary faction set up with a deity, and then your alignment would have some effect on who you would likely interact with as well (again, usually only someone one step removed).

Given that the alignment system started as law vs chaos, it would make some sense, although Rod of Seven Parts certainly suggests lawful = good and chaotic = evil. You'd wonder what happens if the primordial forces of law or chaos won completely. If law won, things would be incredibly boring, there wouldn't be any choice, but people would still be alive.

In D&amp;D, if you go to the 9 Hells you work your way up the ranks (over a few thousand years) to becoming a demon prince, so the ultimate reward is worth the price you pay you get there, and you want to show you're committed to that path by stomping over everyone around you.<br/><br/>You've pretty much got the Abyss to go into, where everyone is backstabbing everyone else, and you could advance pretty quickly if you're smart enough, the 9 Hells where everything is more organised and if you play it right you won't get taken out early, or the really smart route which is becoming a Yugoloth where you're essentially just hired out as guardians and there isn't much in-fighting.<br/><br/>Any of the other alignments, you don't get power. So if you're good, you might get some short term power while alive, but after dying all you get is to be a member of a utopia, and occasionally duke it out with Baatezu and Tanari.<br/><br/>So yeah, you would actually consider yourself evil and see it as a path to power. It would also explain why Evil Wizards become Liches - they're already pretty powerful and they want to stay that way instead of working their way back up as some demon's bitch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_313859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/313859/#Comment_313859" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-23T07:36:40+00:00" title="February 23, 2011  7:36AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>Tristan, I think your pretty much describing Good and Evil as put forth in D&amp;D...</blockquote>\nThat was sort of my point.

John's playing a Thief, and he's decided he's a goblin (using the Halfling move). As we introduced characters, he says he's Good. Of course, he's a Thief, so he can say whatever he wants about his alignment, but he says it's the truth. He was hit by a spell that changed his alignment, he used to be the typical evil goblin. He's not much of a thinker, so he hasn't really pieced together how he's changed. He just knows his former best friend the Bard now seems kind of mean, and that the formerly annoying Ranger is now someone he looks up to.<br/><br/>So, having the idea of being Good or Evil be a concrete thing gave us a great seed for lots of great moments. As it turns out, the spell that shifted the thief's alignment had been planted by the bard, etc.<br/><br/>Yes, we can puzzle over who thinks of themselves as evil and so on, but I tend to view alignment as part of a game as being a cue. When I see alignment, it says: evil is not subtle or banal in this game, it's full-on mustachio-twirling cackling Evil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314125/#Comment_314125" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-24T11:52:11+00:00" title="February 24, 2011 11:52AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool, thanks.

Thinking on it more, I think the thing that really made it cool was that, since being evil or good is something you could objectively be, we could say that a spell did it, and it's a concrete thing. It wasn't a goblin who had become good, he was a goblin who was forced against his will to become good, but now was actually good. Sure, it doesn't make a lot of sense in a real-world way, but in the shorthand of a fantasy RPG, it was great, and led to many great moments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314297/#Comment_314297" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-25T16:24:58+00:00" title="February 25, 2011  4:24PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>What, then, if you've decided to be EVIL in a quest for power (like becoming a lich or demon lord or whatever), but you seek that power because you have a long-term dream to accomplish something GOOD?</blockquote>\nThen you end up as a Ravenloft domain lord, constantly taunted by being unable to do whatever good it was you wanted to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315757/#Comment_315757" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T12:50:21+00:00" title="March  7, 2011 12:50PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read a rather interesting take in AD&amp;D First Quest - alignments aren't there for the players as much as the DM. The characters are heroes, so they're obviously good, and it's a little bit of a guideline for the players on how to act within being good. For the DM, the alignment helps determine how the NPCs will act. If they're lawful it means they're organised and act with planning, and if they're chaotic it means they improvise and do whatever they want. If you're dealing with LE NPCs they'd be heavily organised, fighting in formation, but also predictable. If you're dealing with CE NPCs they'd be scattered, each individual doing their own thing, but unpredictable. In both cases because they're evil, they'd be selfish and not likely to risk their own life to help out an ally. <br/><br/>Of course that conflicts with not having an LG thief, since that would basically be Danny Ocean mixed with Robin Hood, and having detect alignment is rather weird, unless detect evil and know alignment are going for different things, with know alignment being a type of ESP spell that reads general tendencies of someone's personality, while detect evil is meant to find supernatural or particularly powerful evil, so Artemis Entreri wouldn't show up on detect evil, but would show up as evil with know alignment, but Ghost would show up quite readily on detect evil because of the corrupting power of his artifact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13806/d-d-alignments-how-they-make-for-great-gaming" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13806/d-d-alignments-how-they-make-for-great-gaming" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13806/d-d-alignments-how-they-make-for-great-gaming/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13806%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13806%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
