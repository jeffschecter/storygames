Sure, certain things have to remain in place \u2014 there's always a psychic maelstrom, for example \u2014 but just about anything can go so long as it accommodates the roles players may choose.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering... what does your apocalypse look like?<br/><br/>I started my train of thought with <i>The Road Warrior</i> because for me that's the gold standard of apocalyptic movies.  But I also like the idea of an ecological holocaust along the lines of Whitley Strieber and James Kutnetka's novel, <i>Nature's End</i>.  So it's a wide, dry world of little water and less green.  People still possess the gas and the guns to make a hard life livable so long as there's something to take from someone else, but unless there's a ready way to take a drink or grow a plant it's just a matter of time until you dry up and blow away.<br/><br/>Some of the old ways are returning.  They say if a man listens to the wind long enough or stares into the barren flats on walkabout he can hear wisdom and see signs.  But out there in that wilderness there are speed tribes that seek flesh and drink blood and those that wander too far from a holding risk never coming back.  Highways scribe the landscape from dead city to dead city but these, too, are prowled by savage gangs.  Some places even the most devout Hocus won't go.<br/><br/>This is the way the world ended.  But you are still here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245078/#Comment_245078" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T08:14:04+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  8:14AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a> the other day were were discussing a nanotech apocalypse (you weren't there, were you?).<br/><br/>I like the idea of a self replicating "grey goo" nanite that preys exclusively on living organic material and has fairly limited mobility. Forests and farmland have become shimmering oceans of death. Urban centers  are relatively unharmed, but with occasional pockets or outbreaks of nanites.<br/><br/>These urban communities have rapidly descended into savagery and madness as humanity realizes that BILLIONS will go hungry. After a few decades of food riots, starvation, raiding and cannibalism human society is in ruins. Small fortifications protect any community with a food source. Dog farms are the most common source of meat, although some people have managed rat farming as well (although rats seem to have a disturbing tendency to get themselves "eaten" by the goo, so it's difficult to find an initial population for such a farm).<br/><br/>The goo is mostly forgotten as a threat. Starvation and the savagery of your neighbors is much more likely to kill you than accidentally falling into a goo puddle. However, recently some people have been starting to notice that the borders of these seas of nanites aren't as stable as they used to be. In particular smaller pools appear to be more active than before. Although none have been spotted moving, pools are being found where there were none before, and (more rarely) vanishing overnight without a trace.<br/><br/>As for the psychic maelstrom, there are a number of theories. Some people say it is a disturbance in the fabric of the afterlife caused by the release of countless souls over the past decades. Others have a more sinister theory. They say that the electromagnetic field used to synchronize the nanites has become attuned to the same frequencies as human brainwaves. They say that the noise is the nanites talking to each other . . .<br/><br/>Whatever it is, it's getting louder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245096/#Comment_245096" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T09:06:14+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  9:06AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I see it, in Our Apocalypse, the Maelstrom caused the end of the world, or else, the end of the world caused the Maelstrom.

People making dangerous mistakes.  Warlords surrounded by their families and their families families and some farmers, maybe, who all work the Modified Corn fields.  Warlords who get paranoid and hire mercenaries and gun people down for disobeying them.  <br/><br/>As far as the gonzo stuff goes, it's pretty quiet.

I was about two hairs away from running a DivNull Lark contest to build a game/setting in that vein to capitalize on what I expected to be a semi-resurgence of post-apocalyptic gaming that would follow the release of Terminator: Salvation (sort of the way a surge of pirate gaming followed the Pirates of the Caribbean films). Then the movie sucked so bad that it snuffed out all interest I (and probably everyone else) had in the idea. Maybe someday.<br/><br/>In any case, the original idea came from one of my <a href="http://asteroid.divnull.com/2008/07/skynet/" rel="nofollow">blog posts</a>, where I realized that online-poker bots are about halfway to Skynet already, and that (even now) most of the on-line poker in the world is actually these bots playing each other. The draft proposal of the challenge I was thinking of doing expanded on this idea, imagining that these bots (all of which are both distributed and based on the "conflict" of poker) become self-aware:\n<blockquote>Standard science fiction tropes would assume that these new artificial intelligences (AIs) would "rebel against their human masters" or some such, but this is an arrogant, human-centric notion. In this game, these AIs do branch out, altering their programming to function far beyond the world of poker, but they barely even acknowledge the existence of human beings, instead fixated on their real enemies: other AIs.</blockquote>\nSo, in other words, while humans are indirectly responsible for their own destruction, the instrument of this destruction barely even notices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245617/#Comment_245617" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T17:43:40+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  5:43PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "One day, 99,999 people out of 100,000 vanish into thin air."<br/><br/>Bingo.

However, what's clear is that one day, the sun didn't set and since then, it never has. It turns red, casting a sort of twilight glow for about 8 to 12 hours a day, and that's the closest thing anyone's seen to night in living memory.<br/><br/>The local terrain is now a scorched desert. Not the sandy kind (well, there's a bit of that) but a rocky dusty waste speckled with the dry scrubby grasses that can still grow in this mess. Only really desperate people ever try and eat the grass. It tastes like wire and is hard and sharp enough to cut your gums.<br/><br/>People DO however, eat the sand grubs. Anywhere the soil is soft enough there are thick pale worms just below the surface. They're carrion eaters mostly, but will bite living things if given a decent chance. They're chewy and rubbery, but they're a good source of protein and food is hard to come by. They're mush easier than trying to catch what passes for dogs. They probably descended from domesticated dogs, judging by the variety in type and breed, but they all share the same half starved physique and bony saw toothed jaw.<br/><br/>As far as humans are concerned, the center of the world is the imaginatively named Cactus Town. The small stone buildings of the original town have been supplemented with shacks of scrap metal, stone, plastic and even some old weathered scrap lumber. Some "houses" are nothing but tarps and blankets to keep the sun off.<br/><br/>Cactus Town gets its name from its cactus farms. They grow abundantly around the town and their deep thick root systems suggest that there's some source of water down there. Because of the cacti the town has the closest thing to an abundant supply of food (cactus meat), water (cactus juice), alcohol (fermented cactus juice) and drugs (a sort of peyote/mescaline) that anyone around knows of. Trading and barter keeps them supplied with anything they can't make themselves (pretty much anything that's not made from cactus). It's also greatly improved the business of the local bar/whorehouse.<br/><br/>A good portion of that trade comes from the Wasteheap, which isn't a community but supports a tent city of scavengers, looters, outcasts, and the occasional bandit. The story is that the Wasteheap was a town that had a load of garbage dropped on it by some sort of toxic monsoon or tsunami, which of course doesn't really make any sense. It definitely was a town once though, you can see the small, flat, one story roofs poking out from the shorter parts of the pile, and the place does smell sort of like rotten meat dissolved in bleach. What's even stranger is that the supply of junk to scavenge through never seems to run out of worthwhile finds. Some locals claim to have seen new junk fall from the sky, others insist that the fact that the good stuff is usually buried means it's bubbling up from below. The tent city is semi-nomadic (it tends to shift position when the wind changes, to keep it out of the stench) and an unusually large portion of the population owns camels or even small vehicles (people rarely come to them for trade).<br/><br/>The other important settlement in the local economy is known as The Gas Station, although it doesn't have any pumps. It used to be a refinery or a factory of some sort and it has warehouse full of barrels of gas and oil. Like, thousands, maybe tens of thousands. It's currently occupied by a gang of vicious, but enterprising, thugs who use their monopoly to extort food, drugs and guns out of the local traders and anyone else who needs gas (in case it's important, the PCs are traders/smugglers/couriers/guys making a living off an old jeep).<br/><br/>The only other community near by is the mutants. The mutants are so disgusting and unpleasant they aren't even welcome in the Wasteheap. Most of their new population is very young since they tend to live short lives. However, they seem to be reproducing quickly and at a very young age, so their population is more or less stable. In fact, 3rd and even 4th generation mutants exist and seem to be much more healthy and biologically stable than their ancestors. They live in the foothills of the mountains in what might have been an oasis. They do possess the only above ground water source anyone knows of, but it's mostly a puddle of foul smelling sludge and is even more full of arsenic than the ground water around here. From time to time a group of particularly outraged mutants (often lead by a refugee cast out of "normal" society) attempt to raid or otherwise attack a local community, but it's never been serious.<br/><br/>Even scarier than the mutants, for most "civilized" people, are vampires. Not immortal, supernatural monsters, they couldn't escape the sun anyway, but people who, out of desperate thirst or just plain perversion, drink human blood. They aren't a unified group of any sort, which only makes them more terrifying. They usually travel the wastes in small groups, either ambushing travelers or small communities, or infiltrating larger groups and carrying people off in the "night".<br/><br/>So that's about it, the detailed outline of everything in the local area of my post apocalyptic world. My utmost respect to anyone who read through that whole thing.

That was fifty years ago.  The PCs are all children of a small cohort (n = 157), grown in a secret lab, who have escaped into the outside world after the eldest overpowered their scientific masters.  The world, however, is a wasteland of geriatric hedonism - aging people who have given up on the future and are living for the now.  The two remaining generations are people in their 50's and their elderly parents for whom they, sometimes, care.  The game would have a heavy zombie feel as all old people desire children and will amble after them whenever they see them (except key, named, NPCs), calling quietly.  Some of the kids have held up in some places, others travel or even barter with the older generations; still others are all alone and terrified or being taken care of by fearful step-parents who jealously guard them from other would-be parents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296702/#Comment_296702" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-13T10:08:38+00:00" title="October 13, 2010 10:08AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A long time ago, when people died, their souls went somewhere.  At least that's what it sounds like from the old books.  Somehow, that system broke down and now the souls don't go wherever they used to -- they're just backing up all over our world.  They seem to build up in the low places and now there's fog everywhere.  Sometimes you see the ghosts out of the corner of your eye and if you open your brain to them, you might be able to talk to them.  Or maybe you'll be possessed.

The cities still stand (though untended and crumbling), there are smallish bodies of water on the surface (though I think the oceans are dead and gone), and there are still a few animal species around (mostly domesticated ones, though). It's all very still and quiet, though, and there's rarely any wind these days. The sun beats down on everything, withering plants and wearing at man-made structures. If you go out into the Waste unprotected, the sun will kill you in a matter of hours.<br/><br/>I think the planet is geologically dead. At some point, a group of people did something that quietly snuffed out the Earth's life force. That's why people don't really remember the apocalypse--it was a behind-the-scenes kind of thing. Sure society went to hell, but it was already doing that, so that's hardly surprising.<br/><br/>My players are in Fresno, CA for some reason. We randomly picked that. There's a surface body of water out to the west of them, for unknown reasons. The dying remnant of an underground spring, maybe. Raiders and mutants and cannibals and really freaky dudes in burlap robes and sign-post-metal helmets prowl the wastelands. The last hardhold in the area, Fresno (really a block of suburban Fresno fenced off and protected), is breathing its last breaths after raiders assaulted the player characters in the bar at the center of town (it was burned down and now everyone is hunting the players). The only pockets of civilization left are raider strongholds; luckily (for now) a player's character's father is a raider and they were mostly welcomed into a raiding stronghold to the north.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my world. Quiet. Still. Unbearably hot during the day, bone-shatteringly cold at night. It's desperate, but it's a quiet sort of desperation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296730/#Comment_296730" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-13T12:01:07+00:00" title="October 13, 2010 12:01PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We didn't really get into the nature of the apocalypse in my game, although there is an NPC who remembers Old Day, as it's called, and guides the local hardholder in proper Old Day etiquette.  Nobody's asked her what she remembers yet. I have a vague sense that there was an initial disaster, then a time of trouble, and now the little communities along the Old Road are starting to get their shit together and start building up commerce and such.  It's a time when the foundations are being laid for the future world, whether it's going to be a decent place or a land ruled by paranoid Hardholders supported by psychotic armies. <br/><br/>I just can't get into settings like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Road</span>, where the world seems to be really over for good.

Its really rich with apocalyptica.  In episode 2, they discuss kudzu's effects on infrastructure.  I could see a great apocalypse where a fast growing vine covers the planet.  Custom moves would involve sleeping or being unconcious where vines could grow over you.  Crafting environments using the kudzue might allow for networks of tunnels through the vine networks in former cities.  The maelstrom has to do with the plant's neural-like network, like a horrific lovechild of Avatar and The Ruins.<br/><br/>[edit] A quick <a href="http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;expIds=17259,18167,26637&amp;sugexp=ldymls&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=life+after+people&amp;cp=12&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=587" rel="nofollow">Google search for "Life After People"</a> returns plenty of stills from the show that depict recognizable city areas in various states of post-apocalyptic decay.
