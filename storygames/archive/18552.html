That there's something going on? Didn't something strange happen to you lately? No. Hm. Okay, please hear me out before you call me nuts. People have disappeared from my life and no-one but me remembers them. I had this colleague and one day she didn't come to work. No-one noticed. It's like she has never been there. No - she did not just move away or get fired. It's like someone erased her and I'm the only one who notices. Oh, and the people I ask didn't even remember us talking about it five minutes later.<br/></i><br/><br/>This was the opening for a game I played with a friend. I'm not sure what to call it, freeform? I had no idea where it would be going or even if it would work when I came up with it and I was rather nervous when we started, but it worked out beautifully. <br/><br/>In the game:<br/>We talked for a while about how such a thing can be possible - always assuming that I'm not just completely bonkers - and then I started having serious deja vu, like we had done and said this all before. The feeling went away after a while, but we both were suddenly missing people in out lives. Friends we share, people we hang out with - only one of us remembered them. It was ridiculous and we laughed, but there was no denying that this was happening. And then we forgot. What did we talk about? I don't know, roleplaying and stuff, the movie we'd be watching later. Stuff. Nothing out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>Out of the game:<br/>We played the game as ourselves, no characters. I inserted the start of the game into an ongoing conversation, although we later agreed to have some sort of start and stop signal next time (like a coin one player hands to the other). We never really went out of the game while it lasted and we managed to arrive at the same points without talking about it, like when we suddenly both had caught whatever was happening or when we ended the game by forgetting all about it.<br/><br/>We played this game right in the heart of Hamburg, visiting a couple of landmarks on the way and ending up taking the old <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Elbtunnel" rel="nofollow">Elbtunnel</a> to get to the other side of the river. That was not actually planned, but it was a lot of fun to do. <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/bbISW" rel="nofollow">Here's our route.</a> With hindsight, the tunnel was a great way to work towards the end of the game and a nice metaphor. When we arrived on the other end, we pretty much just sat there, looking out over the river towards the city for a good ten minutes, not talking. <a href="http://www.bilderbuch-hamburg.de/bilder/hamburg_st_pauli_hamburger_landungsbr%C3%BCcken_hafen_elbe_wasser_barkasse_anleger_steg_skyline_denkmal_0e45299094_10000x600xin.jpeg" rel="nofollow">The view there is gorgeous</a> and one of my favourite places to see Hamburg.<br/><br/>The game was inspired by a short story by Neil Gaiman, <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cyberpunk/goliath.shtml" rel="nofollow">Goliath</a>. I thought about a couple of other things to do during the game, like pointing out buildings that have not been there yesterday. Or using a tablet/phone that for some reason or other has the ability to show only people that are real, instead of all the people that are just illusions. That would have been a different game, though, maybe I'll try that when I get another chance. This time, we explored how we would deal with it if something like that happens - would we even care if someone told us as long as we did not actually remember the people who are gone?<br/><br/>Another inspiration was the blog Norwegian Style and a <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/three-encounters-with-yourself-by-means-of-guided-and-alert-meditations-in-a-natural-setting" rel="nofollow">game suggested there of just going outside and encounter the supernatural</a>. The idea of just going somewhere and playing there comes from that blog post. We also did the actual game the post described, but that will be another post.<br/><br/>This game was very personal and my absolute favourite part was the way we created the story with unspoken agreement. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy" title="TotallyGuy"><img alt="TotallyGuy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TotallyGuy">TotallyGuy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417274/#Comment_417274" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T02:07:44+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  2:07AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reminds me of a first date I once went on.

I've only done that with children, mostly because it's easier to drag them into an imaginary world. Grown-ups often restrict themselves to do and enjoy free associations. Thanks for sharing.<br/><br/>Building up a joke in a collaborative style works in the same way, where one person makes up a weird and funny situation and others build on that. Like some people sitting in a bar. "We should totally imagine that we were an air band orchestra that wanted to leave all their instruments in the wardrobe." - "Yeah, one guy can leave his air guitar and then the next one another guitar." - "I'm just waiting for someone who wants to leaves the drums."  - "And when everybody have passed the wardrobe, one person can go 'Haha. I smuggled in the flute!"

I did another game with the same friend that was similar to this, I really need to write it up (I've been meaning to for months now) and that was the first time since my childhood I went outside and played make-believe. It still worked and it's a shame that we don't allow ourselves to to that more often.<br/><br/>Chris, my own theory about what made it happen to us was a kind of Matrix we live in and I caught a virus. I transmitted it to my friend and the deja vus were the attempts of the system to repair itself. In the end, the virus was deleted and we were reprogrammed to be good little...what, batteries, computing units, characters in a game? Who knows.<br/><br/>We joked around after the game how it would be to do this to a third person who isn't told that it's a game, but it's not actually all that funny, especially considering people actually have these kind of delusions. Another thing I was considering to bring into the game or to make a game of its own out of is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras%27s_syndrome" rel="nofollow">Capgras's delusion</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fregoli_delusion" rel="nofollow">Fregoli delusion</a>. Both are concepts, if taken for real, that have terrifying consequences. <br/><br/>I do see a danger of losing oneself in such a game, particularly when you play as yourself.  Not a game I would play with someone I don't know very well, I'd be afraid of triggering something.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417290/#Comment_417290" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T06:34:14+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  6:34AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We joked around after the game how it would be to do this to a third person who isn't told that it's a game, but it's not actually all that funny, especially considering people actually have these kind of delusions.</blockquote>\nBased on my experience with collaborative joking. If it's not obvious that the topic is made up, like how people disappeared without anyone noticing it, the person would feel like the odd man out. The thing is, even if that person would understand that you're talking nonsense, it can still render the feel of that person not being able to contribute.<br/><br/>The joke can be funny to make another one wonder what the heck is going on, but it's just funny for a brief moment, and when a minute has passed it's more awkward for the third person because s/he would feel left out. What you need are techniques to drag that person into the conversation. Placing that person into a imaginary situation and then ask questions about it, is one obvious one. Involving things in the story that the person knows really well, and ask about their expertise, is another. Doing a kind of "in game" exercise to help that person to do free associations is a third. Just being able to teach the other in the structure of the communication (accepting/offer) is much worth when it comes to make others contribute.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417300/#Comment_417300" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-27T07:37:54+00:00" title="June 27, 2013  7:37AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Penny For My Thoughts, anyone?

The interpretation there leaned toward dramatic pessimism -- "these people's lives are probably troubled and will come to a grim end".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417401/#Comment_417401" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-28T05:08:43+00:00" title="June 28, 2013  5:08AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Matrix or Inception.<br/><br/>I wonder how you could get players to play out a psychotic delusion if the game were about that.

With the Fregoli delusion, what I'd like to try is a small scene where the person suffering from the delusion finally can't take it any more and tries to confront the one person who has replaced all their friends - who is that person and what do they want? Whether the delusion really is true or not would be the decision of the second player. No idea where this would go, but it would make for an interesting conversation, I think.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
