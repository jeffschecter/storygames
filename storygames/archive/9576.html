I'll probably do Game Chef if it materialises this year, especially if they do another Artists First one, but aside from that I'm feeling somewhat worn out and even a little jaded with the contest culture.<br/><br/>Thing is, I'd like to have another go at running a contest, despite the rather abortive attempt I tried last time (damn depressive spike), but there are just so many of them going on that I think people would just be, like, "Oh, another contest." Sorry for my lack of eloquence tonight, I've been writing all day and I'm all worded out.<br/><br/>Anyway, what does everyone else think? Are there too many contests? Is it just me? Would there be any real point in adding to the glut?

We'll call it the Brand's Contest of Excellence in Roleplaying. Because that sounds like a cool name. <br/><br/>The rules of this contest would go like this: <br/><br/>1) If your game's writing sucks, I will not read it. You lose. <br/>2) If your game uses any mechanic that is a Story Games Darling of the Season, I will not read it. You lose. <br/>3) If your game uses cues to distribute narration rights, I will not read it. You lose. <br/>4) If your game contains reference to anything written by Vincent, Ron, Paul, Matt, other Matt, Luke, or Shreyas, I will not read it. You lose. <br/><br/>5) If your game does not cause me to stop reading it due to violating one of the above rules, I will read it. <br/>6) If it makes me go "Hey, I want to play this" then you move on to Phase 2. If it does not, you lose. <br/><br/>7) I will then play the games that I wanted to play. If I like playing the game, then it will go on to phase 3. If it does not, you lose. <br/><br/>8) In phase 3 I will talk about the game with my group, and probably toss some shit about it around on line. If I want to play it again, then you win and I will send you $20. If I don't, you almost won, but then sucked at the last moment. <br/><br/><br/>It is worth noting that this contest is more or less how I buy RPGs these days, save that as part of the contest you don't get money until phase 3, where as in real life I usually have to pay you around the end of phase 1. So its better for me all around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212451/#Comment_212451" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-15T15:42:04+00:00" title="June 15, 2009  3:42PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2009 3:48PM by ColinC.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Destriarch</cite>What would make it worthwhile?</blockquote>\nIf:<br/><br/>1.

That's pretty vague, so I'll try to give some examples. The Little Game Chef challenge had a suggestion that people hold to 2 page games, and I managed to do so, but had to abandon certain aspects of rpgs in order to fit. Been there. Done that. On the other hand, if the art thing from Game Chef 2008 came up again, I'd enter the art side because I didn't do that before.<br/><br/>So, that's my suggestion. Don't add another contest unless it will push people in new directions. Doing something because it worked before does not mean it will work again unless you've got new people or the old people weren't satisfied with what they did before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212521/#Comment_212521" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T01:25:42+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  1:25AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite><br/>So, that's my suggestion.

Annoyingly, since Game Chef introduces a new element every year, it's getting hard to come up with stuff it hasn't done before. There's also one contest that I really, really loved (and produced one of my favourite games of my own) that never got a sequel. Anyone remember Reversed Engineer? Everyone drew a character sheet with no game, swapped sheets at random with somebody else then designed a game to go with the sheet they got. I loved that one, but that's the only one I'd ever think of immitating and only then because I think as a concept it deserved more than one year of running.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212522/#Comment_212522" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T01:30:12+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  1:30AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, just an idea, I wonder if it would work as a kind of design 'club' rather than an actual contest? i.e. regular challenges get posted, anyone who wants to creates a game to match the challenge and submits it, then anyone else who wants to offers comment and scores on it, maybe with periodic prizes for the ones that get the best results?<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212534/#Comment_212534" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T03:28:44+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  3:28AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with everyone, unless Brand has posted on this thread, in which case I disagree with whatever he's written.<br/><br/>I'm specifically torn between two points:<br/><br/>1.

Here's one I thought about, but didn't run because I was dissappointed that I couldn't get enough players together to playtest the winning games of the contest I did run.<br/><br/><b>One Setting, Two Stories</b><br/><br/>Everybody creates a game setting.<br/>Everybody then creates two rules sets for that setting, designed to support different stories within the setting. This challenges designers to work against themselves to create two really different games. Everyone has habits that we use in mechanics design. This could help people break out of those habits. If going this route, give longer than 10 days.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you could run it like Game Chef 2008. The first stage involves creating settings. The second involves creating rules sets for them. Players then get to compare each others' work, seeing different ways of approaching the same setting, as well as see different ways of structuring setting. This would likely be a week to 10 days per stage.<br/><br/>Yes, it might be possible to reverse it (rules first, setting second), but there's a problem. It has become fashionable to create rpgs where the first step of play is to build the setting, and that pre-empts setting-building part of the contest. It's clumsy to ban such designs, so I suggest have setting building first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212782/#Comment_212782" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-16T21:40:19+00:00" title="June 16, 2009  9:40PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>You need ideas for contests? </blockquote>\nSpeaking of which, what happened to the "suggest a contest idea" thread, which was supposed to be resurrected after a bit?  I never saw it again.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite><br/><b>One Setting, Two Stories</b><br/><br/>Everybody creates a game setting.<br/>Everybody then creates two rules sets for that setting, designed to support different stories within the setting. This challenges designers to work against themselves to create two really different games. Everyone has habits that we use in mechanics design. This could help people break out of those habits. If going this route, give longer than 10 days.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you could run it like Game Chef 2008. The first stage involves creating settings. The second involves creating rules sets for them. Players then get to compare each others' work, seeing different ways of approaching the same setting, as well as see different ways of structuring setting. .</blockquote>\nThis is interesting.  Especially if there's a twist of "everyone designs a setting, then we pick the best one and everyone designs rules for that setting".  Possibly two sets of rules within the same setting.  I know I could have made more than two sets of rules for the Aeromachine challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213158/#Comment_213158" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-18T10:59:13+00:00" title="June 18, 2009 10:59AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9140" rel="nofollow">"I wrote a song about it!

I agree with that too. Contests shouldn't just be about yay, contest. They should be trying to<i>do</i>something interesting.</blockquote>Doesn't make any difference, in my experience. Aside the above all-but-failure, I've also run several Icehouse Game Design Competitions the past couple of years, with minimal participation by designers OR judges, and that's with a theoretical worldwide audience (between IcehouseGames.org and BoardGameGeek promotions).<br/><br/>I've come to the conclusion that the only successful competition is one that has several of the following attributes:<br/>* Name recognition of the organizers and/or judges. (This is remarkably obvious, if one pays attention.)<br/>* Extensive, regular promotion across the Internet. (One site is never enough. Fifty sites MIGHT be.)<br/>* Significant prizes, ideally for more than just First Place. (Cash works, but books or accessories have a surprising cache.)<br/>* Not conflicting with typical busy times: ends of semesters, vacation times, etc. (Dead of winter--February-ish--is often best, it seems.)<br/>* Sponsorship by, promotion prior to, and participation at a major convention. (Typically one-day comps, but they get MOBBED.)<br/>* A vital community of designers reviewing and helping each other during longer-running competitions. (Creativity is contagious; working in a vacuum makes it easier to give up.)<br/>* A unique, inspiring design challenge. (Game Chef popped last year because of Artists First. Conversely, most IGDC Open Design comp submissions are just games folks were making anyway; but new product releases--Martian Coasters most recently--have driven a lot of REALLY cool designs.)<br/><br/>Hope this helps the next comp organizer...
