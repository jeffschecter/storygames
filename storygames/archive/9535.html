I'm going to be picky, since it's for a game I'm writing.<br/><br/>I want art that depicts people made out of objects.<br/><br/>Ideally, they should not be made in a particularly clever way, either. None of these cute little duck-people made of scavenged electrical components. No, imagine someone's walking around a junkyard and says, "Hey, I don't have arms, what's the closest thing I can find on short notice?" and then attaches some copper pipes and needlenose pliers to their jackhammer torso and goes along their way.<br/><br/>All the characters (and indeed the landscape features) in the game are made out of discarded things. Some sample characters that I've worked up so far:\n<ul><li>A refrigerator with vacuum hose arms and legs, rabbit-ear antennae, and a TV inside.</li>\n<li>A womanly shape of burned-out matches, with a chipped porcelain mask and hands made of candelabras.</li>\n<li>Red footy pajamas filled with rusted wind-up toys, carrying sparklers, with a goldfish bowl head.</li></ul>\nDrawings are fine. Grungy, sketchy stuff, dark, maybe ink. Photomanipulation is better. <a href="http://www.mckean-art.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Dave McKean</a> and <a href="http://northerain.deviantart.com/gallery/" rel="nofollow">Northerain</a> are good examples of the sort of photomanipulation style I'm thinking. Edit: Maybe even speedpainting. Grunge is the core idea here.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you do this sort of thing, or know someone who does, I'd love to see it. Even if you're just psyched about the idea and think you can do it well. I should warn you, I'm going to be a little picky.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>--Colin                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211830/#Comment_211830" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T00:53:25+00:00" title="June 12, 2009 12:53AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Think I already answered the RPG Net version of this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211834/#Comment_211834" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T01:20:55+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  1:20AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I'm northerain so...yeah.<br/>Also check out my official portfolio <a href="http://www.ravenkult.com" rel="nofollow">Ravenkult</a> (I don't use deviantart anymore).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
