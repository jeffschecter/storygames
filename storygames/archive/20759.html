Monsterhearts is, at once, a really good fit and a really bad fit for creating that kind of fiction.

I've run only one session of this so far, so it's difficult to draw conclusions. <br/><br/>I'm not sure, for instance, how much of the the thematic shift can be done with player-facing moves and how much can/must come from the MC. For instance, in the session I ran, I informally nixed a couple principles like, "accept people, but only conditionally" and did things like, "give them real friends" or maybe "show them who their real friends are."<br/><br/>I guess I do I think that shift in principles is as important as anything in the player-facing moves.<br/><br/>Re: flags, they're prompts for how you'd like other characters to interact with you. If you're the vampire, you might write one to say "let me feed on you," or "fall in love with me." When someone does, you both mark xp.<br/><br/>Flags come out of a dungeon world context, here's more info: <a href="http://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2015/09/07/from-bonds-to-flags/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://walkingmind.evilhat.com/2015/09/07/from-bonds-to-flags/</a><br/><br/>Another thing that came up in play is the way the level up move neuters xp. You don't really need it, but it makes leveling up less painful. I think I like the level up move more than I like flags/xp, though, if I have to pick one or the other.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455890/#Comment_455890" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-29T19:52:57+00:00" title="August 29, 2016  7:52PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see!

I think I share Paul's confusion about Hold steady and action adventuring. Like, it's totally possible to roll with it and make it fit, but some of the outcomes don't map neatly onto that type of fiction. (I rolled back Hold steady into a more generic Act under fire move for this reason.)<br/><br/>I'm trying to think about what, if anything, is lost from abandoning the original Hold steady move. <br/><br/>Re: the more general concerns about the crossing wires of redemption and self-destruction: I think the concept of the Darkest self has huge utility here. I'm wondering if there's a way of making your Darkest self even more explicitly your antagonist? There's a lot of variability in the self-destructiveness of various skins' Darkest selves. The game I ran had a Ghost in it, for instance, and the Ghost's Darkest self didn't give much mileage as an antagonist.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455897/#Comment_455897" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-30T01:37:37+00:00" title="August 30, 2016  1:37AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also very interested in your Hold steady revision from the other thread:\n<blockquote><br/>When you hold steady...<br/><br/>On a 10+, you're cool.

Do you have any particular thoughts?<br/><br/>I think playing hard with the Darkest Self might be a VERY fruitful direction to go in for this ruleset you're working with.<br/><br/>An initial brainstorm (and this may be going too deep with it, I realize):<br/><br/>When creating your character, define a few things your Darkest Self (your "Shadow"?) likes and wants, and a few things you hate about your Darkest Self.<br/><br/>When it is triggered, there are some bad ongoing things. (Perhaps these are the things you hate about yourself - your Darkest Self is clearly a metaphor for your own self-hatred, right?) Maybe you can't trust anyone or you are unable to have a conversation without putting down or insulting the person you're talking to. These continue until you escape from your Darkest Self.<br/><br/>Your Darkest Self holds some number against you. You can erase this hold by doing the things it wants; once they're all spent, you become yourself again.<br/><br/>Further brainstorm:<br/><br/>Maybe being your Darkest Self is the only way you can gain experience/transform in the game? Each time you emerge from your Darkest Self, you make the "Level Up" move.<br/><br/>Then again, it could just be late at night...
