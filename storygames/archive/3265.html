Certainly D&amp;D 3.x has moved back in that direction, but its interesting that that tradition of play has continued in a section of the hobby that doesn't even really consider it an RPG.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74143/#Comment_74143" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T19:41:05+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  7:41PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2007 7:56PM by komradebob.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's actually more like an evolutionary split. Skirmish miniatures gaming with a bit more story-development thrown in than folks generally associate with one-off battle games is a pretty common ( if not as well-known) form of minis gaming.<br/><br/>I'd also add that a fair players of this type of game have both roleplaying and wargaming backgrounds. More than a few of the folks I've met online who like this stuff have come over to it/added it on in later years.<br/><br/>I'm not sure they'd necessarily appreciate the comparison to newer forms of D&amp;D however; a common complaint I've heard is just how unnecessarily complex and bogged down 3.x can be in compariosn to these games ( an opinion I share, incidently).<br/><br/>You might also want to check into these games if that sort of thing interests you:<br/>Astounding Tales! by Howard Whitehouse<br/>.45 Aventure by Richard Johnson<br/>Legends of Araby by Two-Hour Wargames<br/><br/>The first two are pulp games, the last arabian fantasy (interestingly it also has solo campaign play and character advancement rules).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
