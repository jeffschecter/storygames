Yes, I will admit that the movie has its hokey moments and sometimes characterizations are broad, but it's a solid picture with a very specific, pro-war political stance that makes it somewhat unique.<br/><br/>It's that last that I think dooms <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Berets_(film)" rel="nofollow">The Green Berets</a> to eternal derision, because there's a particular narrative about Vietnam that no one dare deviate from.  It was still in its proto-formation in 1968 when the movie came out but it's definitely solidified into something you'll immediately recognize today.<br/><br/><i>The war is pointless and wastes both American lives and funds.  All soldiers are secretly or openly anti-war.  Every military effort by the Americans is a failure.  All soldiers are addicted to drugs or drink or both.  Atrocities are a regular part of a soldier's life in war.</i><br/><br/>And so on.  Basically if it's negative, it's in there.  Something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon_(film)" rel="nofollow">Platoon</a> exemplifies this with its relentlessly downbeat and anti-war message.<br/><br/>This tendency is carried on into the roleplaying field.  Probably the first game that comes to mind to the indie-gaming crowd is <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16181" rel="nofollow">carry: a game about war</a>, a game that takes its cues from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Things_They_Carried" rel="nofollow">The Things They Carried</a> (natch), but also the Vietnam cinema that supports the above narrative.  Certainly there's nothing in the game that specifically forbids the inclusion of positive moments, but you can tell the author's intent would be subverted by such a thing.  I also tend to think the game would fall apart if players worked against the anti-war clich\xe9s.<br/><br/>Let me state right here that I have nothing against <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16181" rel="nofollow">carry</a> and very much want to play it.  Don't write to me saying, "Hey, man, you're dishing on <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16181" rel="nofollow">carry</a>!"  Because I'm not doing that.  I'm only pointing out that it's part of the prevailing narrative of Vietnam, which contains a whole raft of clich\xe9s particular to the anti-war sentiment, just as a relentlessly pro-war stance has its own clich\xe9s.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was looking at games like <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16181" rel="nofollow">carry</a> and <i>Shell Shock</i> \u2014 the latter of which, admittedly, is about <i>any</i> war, not just Vietnam \u2014 and wondering just how one would go about telling a story about Vietnam that <i>doesn't</i> fit the anti-war narrative.  The last game to take a fairly pro-war stance, or at least not a definitively <i>anti-war</i> stance was Palladium's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recon_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">Recon</a>, originally released in 1986 during the height of the Reagan era.  But until one wants to tangle with a decidedly old-school system and try to tease some story out of it, you're out of luck.<br/><br/>How do we go about telling a story like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Berets_(film)" rel="nofollow">The Green Berets</a>?  Where's the story game that allows for a positive approach to America's most unpopular war.  If we don't want to wallow in the soul-destructive, corrosive pool that a game like <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16181" rel="nofollow">carry</a> encourages, what do we use?  What do we do?  Does this really call for an entirely new system with mechanisms in place to encourage positive messages?  And is it even possible to do so?<br/><br/>I wonder.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251246/#Comment_251246" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T08:46:42+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  8:46AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geez, I think this is an ill-conceived idea.\n<blockquote><cite>Roger Ebert said at the time</cite>"The Green Berets" simply will not do as a film about the war in Vietnam.

Admittedly both games intend to subvert this exterior premise, but I find the ideological conflict is heightened if the game-master (i.e. HQ or Friend Computer and their minions) refuses to acknowledge error or irony in his representations until the game is over. Some players simply will not rebel against 'fun' brutality and murder. This is excellent; awful but excellent. <br/><br/>I wanted to write a game along the lines of  R. C. Sherriff's <i>Journey's End</i> involving the struggle between the oppressive horrors of trench warfare and a sense of patriotic duty to overcome them. I've always been fascinated by figures such as Wilfred Owen, a British officer and poet who, despite writing some of the most compelling anti-war verse of the age, was awarded the military cross for personally capturing a machine-gun nest and showing behavior 'most gallant' in the face of overwhelming odds.  It'd be a tragic and likely terrible game, but it'd be a formative experience for a committed playgroup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251262/#Comment_251262" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T10:53:52+00:00" title="January 18, 2010 10:53AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was insufficiently clear. If you're going to take <i>Green Berets</i> as the ur-text of a story-game about Vietnam, you can't ignore the fact that it is widely regarded as <i>wholly divorced from the reality on the ground</i>: a propaganda film, pure and simple. The only way to deal with that from a design perspective is to acknowledge that a Green Beret version of Vietnam would have to be a <i>fantasy</i>. <br/><br/>One version of this is "reverse PowerKill": play <i>carry</i>, and have the PCs torch hooches and frag cherry LTs but then have a PowerKill move where the GM tells the players how their characters were heroes and patriots fighting to save an unappreciative native populace from the perils of Communism; alternately, play old school D&amp;D and translate it similarly: the dungeon is the jungle, the orcs are the VC, "town" is the Land of the Round Door Knobs.<br/><br/>It's a false move to argue that, oh, there are these different interpretations of Vietnam and they are totally distinct. Rather, the controversy over the legacy of Vietnam is part of the material that one has to include in any attempt to interpret it, so the decision to <i>ignore</i> that controversy to tell the story of Vietnam as an instance of patriotism pure and simple smacks of puerile jingoism.<br/><br/>I think any effort to re-tell Vietnam as a feel-good story of wartime heroics will rapidly descend into self-parody.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi" title="AnttiKi"><img alt="AnttiKi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.veljeskunta.info/anttiki/antti4_icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnttiKi">AnttiKi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251335/#Comment_251335" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T22:00:29+00:00" title="January 18, 2010 10:00PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe PTA (oh wait, I have an actual idea, not just shouting PTA randomly) with a strong meta-level emphasis on making a propaganda TV show to support the on-going war in Vietnam?

A game that could be used to tell a positive story about *a* war, and hence could be used specifically to tell an overall positive story about the Vietnam war<br/>2. A game that somehow is specifically geared to tell a positive story about the Vietnam war<br/>3. A game (variant on 1 or 2) that not only can tell a story about the war where it is, on balance, a good thing, but where there is no anti-war issue or pressure *at all*?<br/><br/>2 seems way too specific (but, since, say WWII doesn't have the same social narrative that you're worried about, yet people run games set during WWII, maybe I'm missing something about why you think existing games don't work for Vietnam specifically), but 1 and 3 are different and I'm not sure which one you're asking for.  I think 3 might be the wrong thing to go for - since most "stories" in the sense you seem to think D&amp;D or Twilight 2000 are not "story games" are in some way about moral conflict, and "do we have a good reason for killing these folks" is the 800 pound gorilla of moral conflicts in war.  If you ignore that issue then, yeah, I think you tread into the realm of being only able to do pro-war *propaganda*, not an honest pro-war stance (think of, say, Red Dawn vs. - if we extend "pro-war" a bit loosely - Army of Shadows).  In a nutshell, I think you're likely to fall afoul of Ben's point.<br/><br/>If all you want is 1, then it doesn't actually seem that hard.  Heck, even carry could be read, if you were so inclined, as about the way in which war is a necessary but brutal undertaking and crushes the souls of combatants even as it is the only way to destroy evil (I guess).  A game like Unsung could certainly focus on the small-scale moral choices that face soldiers (e.g., do I break my word to this intelligence source that I would protect him?  Do I torture these prisoners for crucial information?) in the context of a background assumption that the overall war is just.  You might even be able to use something like Dogs in the Vineyard - assume that the US' superior firepower (on the local scale, not the strategic) means that essentially no-one can gainsay your unit's decision about how to deal with a village.  Kobayashi's approach sounds pretty solid for finding those lower-scale moral conflicts.<br/><br/>I haven't seen Green Berets - in my mind, I am substituting Red Dawn - but if you really want the conflict to be *just* about overcoming non-moral obstacles (can we find the sniper, can we rescue our buddy), and that doesn't tackle the propaganda aspects, as PTA might, then I think a game like D&amp;D will probably work fine, for "story" in that sense.<br/><br/>That said, and putting my personal convictions hat on, my initial reaction to the question, "how can I run a game where the Vietnam War is awesome and was totally a good idea" is nervousness.<br/><br/>ETA: A parenthetical caveat about dismissing option 2.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251420/#Comment_251420" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T13:10:57+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  1:10PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I think Francois Truffaut claimed there was no such thing as an anti-war film.

The notion that you're going to make a story-game that systematically excludes anti-war sentiment in order to provide a "different spin" on it amounts to propaganda, since any realistic depiction of modern warfare has to include the fact that it is inevitably filled with stupidity, brutality, and cruelty. My own very peripheral but nonetheless real experience of combat convinces me that accounts like <i>Catch-22</i> and <i>The Thin Red Line</i> come closest to capturing its essence. Nonetheless, having decided to go "pro-war," you have to figure out exactly what that means: are you celebrating manly virtue, patriotic service (dulce et decorum est, pro patria mori), or the bonds of camaraderie?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251431/#Comment_251431" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T13:55:22+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  1:55PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll come back to add some responses with more meat on them, but in the meanwhile you <a href="http://www.samhawken.com/?p=2349" rel="nofollow">read my review of <i>The Green Berets</i></a>, which may expand a little more on my feelings concerning this particular film and the conflict it depicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251432/#Comment_251432" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T13:57:11+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  1:57PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, <br/>I'm going to take a stab at what you're looking for: do you want a thing where you can have a meaningful story-game happen about Vietnam, but without anti-war sentiment baked in already?<br/>It's *possible* that you are seeking an explicitly pro-war experience to revel in; if that's the case, then I don't know enough games out there to be of help to you. <br/>Do you want a situation where you can "start afresh" and express any opinions about the war that you like? <br/><br/>I don't have suggestions for you as much as I am just trying to better understand where you're coming from.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251443/#Comment_251443" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T14:22:32+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  2:22PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>I'm going to take a stab at what you're looking for: do you want a thing where you can have a meaningful story-game happen about Vietnam, but without anti-war sentiment baked in already?</blockquote>\nBingo.<br/><br/>The thing about <i>The Green Berets</i>, and this is something that admittedly is hard to put across to those who haven't seen it, is that all the familiar elements from an anti-war Vietnam movie are in there, from the bleak outcome of the assault on Two Niner Savoy to the realities of fighting a war with no front lines to the deadly nature of booby traps and natural hazards in the jungles.  It's not hard-edged stuff because movies in 1968 didn't traffic in the kind of intensity we take for granted now, but there's a serious look being taken at what made Vietnam a different and more difficult war than the ones we'd fought previously.<br/><br/>With <i>The Green Berets</i>, though, the emphasis is decidedly different than something like, say, <i>Platoon</i>.  The approach <i>The Green Berets</i> takes is that the war is a grueling conflict that will cost many lives, but it's worth it because it's taking a stand against the Communists.  Granted, this might seem like a ridiculous thing given our perspective from 2010, but at the time and for years afterward this was a deadly serious issue.  So my take is: why not address it seriously?  Why work immediately from the premise that Vietnam was a bloody, stupid war without a point?<br/><br/>I'm not asking for the wild-eyed anti-Communism of the games I played years ago, where the bad guys might as well have been wearing horns and carrying pitchforks, but it would be interesting to me, as a child of the '70s and '80s, to go where we <i>might</i> have gone back then, only armed with today's roleplaying tools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251445/#Comment_251445" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T14:31:11+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  2:31PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't offer much in the way of RPG rules that *drive* for what you want, so I'll leave that to the war game fans.<br/><br/>I found myself thinking, however, as I read this thread, "Seems to me that the interesting elements of such a game would not be to 'bake-in' pro- or anti-war sentiment but to, instead, have some metric, system, or even situation generator that would inform the overall narrative arc. Vietnam *could* have been a Good War, if X, Y, and Z had happened; what would the X, Y, and Z be, both generically (to run with other wars or fictional wars) and specific to that conflict?"<br/><br/>I dunno... maybe this should go to the FREE IDEAS thread at Praxis, but wouldn't determining the moral rectitude of a war, during play, based on actual actions of PCs, be more interesting than the "moral railroad" of a pro- or anti-war game? <i>Dogs in Danang</i>, not <i>carry</i> or <i>Germany 1939</i>.<br/><br/>But, you know... that's just me.

To keep this thread on games more than politics, that's one reason why I don't think it's all that difficult to run a game about any war that's agnostic about the war's *overall* justice, so long as you focus on what's going on with people at a fairly low level.  Catch-22 is maybe a reverse of the Vietnam case - it could well be that the fight against Hitler and his allies was of utmost moral importance, while the war itself was absurd at the level of individual soldiers.<br/><br/>ETA: Thinking about JDCorley's comment, especially... I say this in all seriousness, and not just to pick a fight.  Pretty much all the games that take the morality of war seriously are the ones that you have cited as having an anti-war bent "baked in."  Maybe this isn't a function of the games, but something that emerges whenever you think seriously about the morality of war.  Maybe the pressure to find war bloody and pointless, even in cases that seem to have good overall goals, is not a function of the games - but a function of war.  RPGs have avoided making war horrific by evading the morality of war entirely (or fantasy-reifing it, like D&amp;D).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251478/#Comment_251478" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T17:29:49+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  5:29PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2010 5:30PM by Kobayashi.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>If there are a few games that are not like this, they're tiny, tiny exceptions.<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, that was pretty much my point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251595/#Comment_251595" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T10:37:10+00:00" title="January 20, 2010 10:37AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Or if you want to assume the premise that America was doing the Good and Right Thing in Vietnam,<i>carry</i>will let you do that, too.

The minute you start questioning the rightness or wrongness of killing people in war, you're one step away from concluding war is a wrong because it's the instrument by which the killing is imposed in the first place.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong: I'm not saying that I'm always pro-war.  I believe there's a time and a place where war is a necessary tool, and times when war is a terrible mistake.  As it happens I'm one of those who see the Vietnam War as a good deed mishandled, which is why I've grown more than a little tired over the years of the prevailing narrative concerning that conflict, as it does a terrible disservice to the many who served believing in the rectitude of what they were doing.  And, yes, those people do exist and in greater numbers than the clich\xe9s would suggest.<br/><br/>Getting down to specifics: I don't think it's a stretch to say that <i>Carry</i> has an anti-war message built in.  As I said at the outset, it can be played in the manner which I'm describing, but that would be a clear violation of the spirit of the game.  And as Alexandre points out, his game <i>Shell Shock</i> is explicitly anti-war.  So playing "a different kind of Vietnam story" would be not impossible, but certainly at odds with the designer's intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252472/#Comment_252472" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T05:43:57+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  5:43AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>As it happens I'm one of those who see the Vietnam War as a good deed mishandled</blockquote>\nlol                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252484/#Comment_252484" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T06:34:53+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  6:34AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite> And as Alexandre points out, his game<i>Shell Shock</i>is explicitly anti-war.</blockquote>\nIt's a little more subtle than that. <i>Shell Shock</i> is about choices soldiers may have to make during a war and the consequences of these decisions on their lives.

To permit a citizen to ask at all "is this war justified" rather than reply "yes, let's kill the brutes" when asked is fundamentally an anti-war act.

Also, I think you should *play* carry, if you haven't (my impression is that you haven't, but I could be reading wrong).  I'd suggest you play Ram, if you can.<br/><br/>If you'll indulge me in some professional jargon... just war theorists break war down into *jus ad bellum* - the justice of entering a war - and *jus in bello* - the justice of one's conduct of the war - phases.  Traditionally, these are understood to be separable.  That is, one can fight for a just cause using unjust means (a common example given is Palestinian terrorism) or one can fight for an unjust cause, but fight justly (a common example given is Erwin  Rommel).  There's a lot of current debate about whether the categories are really that separable, and of course the examples are deeply contestable, but I hope the distinction is at least roughly intuitive.<br/><br/>In the case of Vietnam, I can see the two getting conflated because the "dominant narrative" you complain about is that the war was *both* unjust *and* often or even predominantly fought unjustly.<br/><br/>Now, the first reason to make the distinction is that the main games you've mentioned are really about jus in bello considerations - how individual soldiers act in the conduct of the war.  I'm not familiar with Shell Shock, but that's certainly the focus of games like carry or Unsung.  That may be some of the going around in circles in this thread - you can perfectly well have a game that focuses on the moral challenges facing individual soldiers while endorsing the overall war, or remaining agnostic about its justification.  In fact, I think it would be impossible to have a morally interesting character in a war game *unless* s/he thought the war was justified or was motivated by some other positive value, like honor (the caricature at least of Gen. Lee) or loyalty to comrades.  A game about war where all the PCs were what you describe - wastrels who hate killing and think the war is pointless would probably be really depressing and boring (maybe it would be about the way we all do things because authorities tell us to even when we know it's wrong, or something - so at least depressing).  Even in a game like 3:16, the moral interest is maintained in large part through dramatic irony - *we* (the players) know that the PCs are part of unthinkable atrocity, and so we wait for their epiphany or comeuppance.<br/><br/>If you wanted a game about jus ad bellum concerns, that would be very different - you know, it'd be about politicians duking it out with Duels of Wits or some such.  It's also why I'm confused about why you think Vietnam poses a *special* problem for this - there's no such "narrative" about WWII (at least it's far from the dominant one), yet your arguments would seem to imply that it'd be impossible to run a "positive" WWII game.  That seems like a *reductio*.<br/><br/>The flip side is that I can't see what you want out of a game that would retain its moral interest, if you want to portray Vietnam as justified overall and also object to characters who may face moral dilemmas as part of the war... where's the story?  If you're not allowed to question even the rightness or wrongness of killing *this* person *here*, what is your story about?  I mean, you could tell an interesting story that skirts the margins of the war (like much of Catch-22) but I take it that you're not interested in a game that's about Marine supply officers trying to maintain their good cheer amidst office politics.<br/><br/>If the game is *just* about meeting non-moral challenges, then I don't really see why you've ruled out some games that you ruled out, like D&amp;D.  If the question facing players is usually something like, "can we take out that sniper before he gets our buddies," why not use a game that's mostly about tactical simulation of some sort?  <br/><br/>So, in order to make heads or tails of what you want, I'm left with a few questions:<br/><br/>1. If you think Vietnam was justified, why do you assume that even asking if killing is wrong is a step away from being anti-war?  Couldn't the answer plausibly be, no, in this case killing is not wrong?<br/><br/>2. Why should asking whether killing is wrong in *this* circumstance be scandalously anti-war?  <br/><br/>3. If you're ruling out questions like 2, what sort of moral questions *do* you want to face characters?<br/><br/>4. If you don't want the game to focus on *moral* questions, why rule out primarily tactical games like D&amp;D and so forth?<br/><br/>5. How would you run a "story" game about a unit in WWII that wasn't "anti-war," and why can't you do that for Vietnam?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252498/#Comment_252498" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T07:27:43+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  7:27AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>As it happens I'm one of those who see the Vietnam War as a good deed mishandled</blockquote>\nlol<br/>I do love a nice, substantive contribution to a thread, don't you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252499/#Comment_252499" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T07:28:30+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  7:28AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel --<br/><br/>Very helpful! Thanks for posting that. <br/><br/>Were I Sam, I would want a "Band of Brothers" game, but set in Vietnam to suit my ideological predilections (they can only be ideological, because the belief that the Vietnam War was "a good deed mishandled" is so far at odds with the reality of the cynical Cold War strategic calculations that caused us to support and then supplant France as colonial power in Indo-China in the decades after World War II as to defy correction).<br/><br/>In that case, the game would follow a bunch of soldiers -- call 'em First Platoon -- at Fire Base Charlie. Their mission is to hold out until relieved. One player is the LT, another is the Platoon Sergeant, and the rest are grunts. The LT's job is make sure First Platoon holds Fire Base Charlie; the Platoon Sergeant's job is to take care of the men, and the grunts' job is to have problems that make the LT's job harder and the Platoon Sergeant's interesting. The grunts can help each other out, but doing so is risky to the extent that it makes you more vulnerable, less able to concentrate on staying alert and staying alive.<br/><br/>Every so often, there's a VC attack, and soldiers get killed. The survivors mourn the dead and carry on the mission. The game ends when either everyone dies or DEROS's back to the States.<br/><br/>Actually, I guess that's pretty close to <i>carry</i>, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252500/#Comment_252500" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T07:36:14+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  7:36AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2010 7:36AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or Recon, or the whole rest of the frickin' hobby, as I say.<br/><br/>I still can't believe we're still here scratching our chins and wondering if violence is justified and celebrated <i>enough</i> in RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252505/#Comment_252505" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T07:49:53+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  7:49AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel Levine</cite>I can't help but think you've painted yourself into a corner here.

The difference there is actually pretty stark: no one disagrees with the central premise of the Second World War, whereas you have mouth-breathers like Jeff who have a reflexive distaste for Vietnam that's more then likely uninformed by the facts.<br/><br/>In a WWII game you could talk about the dehumanizing effects of combat and the grueling reality of taking other human beings' lives, but you're not going to have the disconnect on a base level with what's happening.  Axis bad, Allies good and anything else that proceeds from that will still conform to the model.<br/><br/>It's probably beyond the scope of this discussion \u2014 actually it <i>definitely</i> is \u2014 but I wonder exactly who the anti-Vietnam crowd sees as the good guys and the bad guys.  Chances are probably pretty good that they: 1) see the Americans as the clear aggressors, and therefore the "bad guys" of this equation, or 2) posit a scenario in Vietnam that consists entirely of gray areas, with the Americans and the Communists on equal moral footing.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, I really don't want to get bogged down in a lengthy argument over the relative merits of the Vietnam conflict.  My premise, put forth at the top of this thread, is that there's a particular narrative that informs Vietnam gaming (what little there is) and that narrative is either explicitly or implicitly anti-war either in terms of war in general or war in Indochina.<br/><br/>I wonder if it's even <i>possible</i> to have a <i>Green Berets</i>-style story-gaming experience given the power of that predominant narrative.  In that film there were moral conflicts, but these conflicts were viewed through the anti-Communist prism.  The moment of breakthrough, as a result, <i>wasn't</i> that in which when the soldier decides there's no point in fighting in Vietnam except for his own life and the life of his buddies, but when the soldier decides the lives of him and his buddies are being given over to a noble cause.  Again, you can see how one result works great in a WWII setting but falls apart when you're faced with the whole <i>Vietnam BAD!</i> mentality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252508/#Comment_252508" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T07:57:33+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  7:57AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Were I Sam, I would want a "Band of Brothers" game, but set in Vietnam to suit my ideological predilections (they can only be ideological, because the belief that the Vietnam War was "a good deed mishandled" is so far at odds with the reality of the cynical Cold War strategic calculations that caused us to support and then supplant France as colonial power in Indo-China in the decades after World War II as to defy correction).</blockquote>\nI have to disagree with you there, and while I can't wave my terminal-degree credentials the way Daniel can (and God bless 'im), I will say that there's a substantial minority of those involved in the Vietnam conflict who saw what they were doing as a just thing.  There's a difference between the whole "the dominoes must not fall!" mindset of the strategic planners and the point of view of warfighters directly engaged in the nuts-and-bolts of making the war happen.  And there's a strong case to be made that something like the Khmer Rouge bloodbath in Cambodia could have been averted if we'd managed to keep South Vietnam independent of the Communist north.<br/><br/>But as I said earlier, I really don't want to get into an argument about the fundamental rightness or wrongness of the Vietnam War.  For one thing, it'll go nowhere and for another thing it's not the premise of this thread, which is how one can have a Vietnam story game that subverts the popular narrative.<br/><br/>As for your idea that <i>carry</i> could tell the kind of story I'm talking about: well, I'm listening.

It might actually help if anyone in the discussion had actually seen <i>The Green Berets</i>, so I wouldn't have to keep reiterating the premise.  It's kind of like the blind men and the elephant right now.<br/><br/>You can't have a game about war without violence.  That much we can all agree on.  The question is on what moral grounds do we stage that violence?  I have posited this: that games about Vietnam are delivered from the position that the war was unjustified.  What I wondered at the start was if it was possible to have a story gaming experience that delivers the Vietnam War from the position of <i>The Green Berets</i>: that the war was justified.<br/><br/>Changing that one thing changes everything.  As Daniel asked in his post, why can you tell a certain story in WWII that you can't in Vietnam?  Because no one questions that WWII was justified.  Even the combat in WWII that was quite similar to that of Vietnam (certain campaigns in the Pacific Theater) still comes from the root position that the war is justified.  And just as it would be an extremely difficult thing to subvert that and have a story game that finds WWII unjustified, I see it as similarly difficult to have a Vietnam game where the base premise is a justified war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252516/#Comment_252516" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T08:16:39+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  8:16AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, I think you want Polaris, or perhaps Thou Art But A Warrior, drifted to portray the South Vietnamese fighting against communism, the NVA, and the corruption in their own government.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252517/#Comment_252517" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T08:19:11+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  8:19AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2010 8:19AM by FigureFour.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>As Daniel asked in his post, why can you tell a certain story in WWII that you can't in Vietnam?

I don't agree with you that (for example) Recon isn't a story game.  I think it very much is a story game, and so is D&amp;D ("fantasy Vietnam" is actually a relatively common mode of play, often explicitly named such) and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252523/#Comment_252523" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T08:33:22+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  8:33AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me respond with a general thought and a bit of AP.<br/><br/>I think we may have hit on a productive thing - it sounds like your sticking point is not the game but the players.  In that sense, it's not that carry has anti-war "baked in."  It may be that your real worry is that your *players* have anti-(Vietnam)-war baked in, and will use the moral questions that carry raises to run with that view.  If that's the case, I have a few thoughts:<br/><br/>1. You're not going to change anyone's mind about Vietnam just by playing a game.  For instance, if the mounds of scholarship on Vietnam haven't convinced you there's a good reason why the dominant narrative is the dominant one, I would have no illusions that I'd change your mind by running a game of carry (or even my new game "Commies Were Awesome and Jeff Zahari is Right About Everything"). <br/><br/>2.  That said, if you just want to have a game that's not saddled with everyone being a downer about Vietnam, you'd probably do better either just to enter the game by saying something like, "hey, this isn't a game about the morality of Vietnam, this is a game where we're going to run with a patriotic read and focus on green berets being badass," and get everyone on board.  When I play D&amp;D, I don't ruin everyone's fun by making a character who moans about the morality of killing orcs (unless that's the point of the game we're playing).  Or, create a situation that's Vietnam-like, but without the baggage - the fight against guerilla space orcs or something.<br/><br/>3.  If you do have the goal of illuminating a particular perspective, it's probably *better* to run a more oblique game.  If I wanted to convince people that UN peacekeeping was awesome who were skeptical of trying to help people in intractable conflict, I'd probably run Dogs in the Vineyard in the canonical setting rather than my Unsung UN peacekeepers scenario.  In fact, I think much of the effectiveness of any anti-war message in carry comes from this sort of roundabout approach - unlike Jason, I think a character like Ram - while not being conflicted about the war, or fucked up on drugs, as written - ends up being much more likely to induce anti-war feelings *in play* than one of the more messed-up characters.  You *know* that war is likely to further mess up someone who's already broken.<br/><br/>* As an aside, I don't think I've done any waving of my terminal degree here.  I find it helpful and illuminating but totally uppity-sounding to use the latin just war jargon, so was trying to apologize for it.  My arguments here stand or fall on their own merits - it's not like I *hide* my degree, but I'm pretty sure to know that I have one you'd have to cross-reference this thread with my faculty bio and/or the Who Are You thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252524/#Comment_252524" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T08:35:38+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  8:35AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>Sure, I could take Deep7's 1PG<i>Battleforce Bravo</i>and just set the adventures in Vietnam, but it wouldn't be a story game.</blockquote>\nWell, there's your problem.

Please tell me more.  Seriously.</blockquote>\nThere's not much to tell. Plenty of people played GM-and-players-and-task-resolution games for many years for story, and they had a good time and obtained what they wanted. Thus they are, or probably more precisely <i>can be</i> story games.  The responsibility for structuring the story lies primarily with the GM in such games, although there's sometimes some other methods (levelling/XP, gold, mission objectives, victory points, etc.)  The main advantage of this is that it allows for extensive customization of the narrative without altering the dice mechanics. I can tell you that I played Recon very differently after I learned something more about the Vietnam War than watching Platoon (and I have seen The Green Berets, yes.)  But I didn't have to learn a new set of die rolling.  Player direction of the story is vested solely in the fiction-level instruments of their characters, though as we all know, with creative and driven players, that power is more than sufficient to have massive or even controlling contributions.<br/><br/>I don't even consider it that controversial that D&amp;D is and always has been a story game by any feasible definition of story game. The term wouldn't make any sense otherwise, or the preference that plenty of D&amp;D players have stated over time, "I like my game for the story!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252558/#Comment_252558" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T10:04:03+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 10:04AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Were I Sam, I would want a "Band of Brothers" game, but set in Vietnam to suit my ideological predilections (they can only be ideological, because the belief that the Vietnam War was "a good deed mishandled" is so far at odds with the reality of the cynical Cold War strategic calculations that caused us to support and then supplant France as colonial power in Indo-China in the decades after World War II as to defy correction).</blockquote>\nI have to disagree with you there, and while I can't wave my terminal-degree credentials the way Daniel can (and God bless 'im), I will say that there's a substantial minority of those involved in the Vietnam conflict who saw what they were doing as a just thing.  There's a difference between the whole "the dominoes must not fall!" mindset of the strategic planners and the point of view of warfighters directly engaged in the nuts-and-bolts of making the war happen.  And there's a strong case to be made that something like the Khmer Rouge bloodbath in Cambodia could have been averted if we'd managed to keep South Vietnam independent of the Communist north.<br/><br/>But my point is that the domino-theory geopolitical calculations are <i>inextricable</i> from the context of any story about Vietnam, because they (and not preventing genocide across the border in Cambodia) were the rationale supplied for the warfighting mission in the first place. The fact that some soldiers believed in the anti-Communist mission and -- what's more -- behaved honorably on the battlefield doesn't change the fundamentally erroneous (and arguably unjust) strategic thinking. In fact, I would argue that a soldier's perception of the "rightness" of his or her mission is <i>completely irrelevant</i> to later historical judgments: we <i>expect</i> soldiers to believe in what they're doing--that's why we <i>indoctrinate</i> them. Nearly twenty years ago, when I was shooting rockets in the desert at Republican Guard units 25 km away, I didn't care whether we were fighting for oil or to free Kuwait or whatever: I just wanted to shoot some goddamn rockets. And everything I've read about the psychology of war convinces me that most soldiers stay in the fight in order not to let their buddies down, not out of any particularly patriotic conviction (though this certainly may play a role in recruitment and retention over the course of a career).<br/><br/>Now, you used the term "warfighter" which is a phrase that I've come to associate with a particular operational-level professional--what the XO of my old unit would have called an "operator"--who is mainly concerned with the management of warfare: getting Unit A to point X with enough personnel, equipment, supplies, and ammunition to perform its tactical mission (whether that mission is combat, combat support, or something else). But again, we would expect the strategic judgments of even those military professionals to assume rather than argue the "rightness" or "necessity" of their mission. We pay them for their managerial expertise, not their strategic judgments.<br/><br/>All of this goes to the point that I am trying to make, but which I suspect you simply can't hear. And that is that you can't play a story-game about the Vietnam War specifically that does not acknowledge the fraught socio-political context in which it occurred and expect that story-game to be anything but wishful thinking at best and revanchist propaganda at worst. You can have heroic Green Berets living among the Montagnards and interdicting Commies on the Ho Chi Minh trail in the hopes of creating a better tomorrow, but you can't pretend that the story has a happy ending. The best you can do is lay the blame on the parties you find the most odious. <br/><br/>An additional point: you note that no one doubted the rightness of WW II, but this is not exactly true. Certainly there are very few people today who will argue against its justice or strategic necessity (but there are indeed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill,_Hitler_and_the_Unnecessary_War" rel="nofollow">some</a>), but during the run-up to World War II, there was a rather strong <a href="http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1601.html" rel="nofollow">isolationist</a> sentiment that only Pearl Harbor finally put paid to.<br/><br/>Thus: today we can tell stories about World War II that ignore pacifist and isolationist sentiment, because there is a general consensus as to the justice of the war. We can't tell the same sorts of stories about Vietnam, because the same sort of consensus doesn't exist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252564/#Comment_252564" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T10:16:31+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 10:16AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2010 10:16AM by Valamir.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>Sure, I could take Deep7's 1PG<i>Battleforce Bravo</i>and just set the adventures in Vietnam, but it wouldn't be a story game.</blockquote>\nWell, there's your problem. I don't agree with you that (for example) Recon isn't a story game.<br/>I actually find this assertion interesting enough that it could provide fuel for a whole new discussion. Please tell me more. Seriously.<br/><br/>JD is the resident curmudgeony banner carrier for the notion that any game can be considered a story-game if once upon a time someone successfully managed to actually tell a story using it.<br/><br/>Although I will say, having played the hell out of Advanced Recon...it pretty much is the game you're looking for.  Crazy rules lite to the extent that 4 players could run an entire platoon worth of characters using a handful of index cards.  The game is maximized for running through missions so lightening fast that we could do several patrols in an evening where the only mechanics we had to worry about was who survived and what the body count was.  <br/><br/>The game itself is just a mechanical framework for sneaking through the jungle and setting up ambushes (or stumbling into them) while calling in airstrikes and artillery fire.  After that, any story you want can be layered on top.  We didn't bother with any of that, cus for us it was just ASL without the stack of rules binders, but you can do pretty much whatever you like with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252566/#Comment_252566" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T10:20:15+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 10:20AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2010 8:52AM by Andy.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: Bill_White<br/>\nAll of this goes to the point that I am trying to make, but which I suspect you simply can't hear.

The best you can do is lay the blame on the parties you find the most odious.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis actually gets, I think, to what's interesting about this conversation (it's not the substantive discussion of the justice of Vietnam, on which my views are probably closest to Jeff's).  I keep putting "story games" in quotes because, like Jason, I'm not sure how or why to draw the line and why D&amp;D or Twilight 2000 end up on the wrong side of it.  But I do think there's an interesting distinction to be made here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been talking about games that pose moral choices, which is basically my best approximation of what Sam means by "story games" in this context.  But even here there's a distinction.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could approach a game as a kind of "morality sim."  In this case, I think it is entirely possible to have a game that is about Vietnam and doesn't fully acknowledge the socio-political context.  You could just have a game that was basically about, "what if I were some green beret who cared about the mission but had to make hard choices, and didn't have 50 years of hindsight and context to draw on?  What would my guy do?"<br/>\n<br/>\n*Or* you can have a game that you approach as a way of engaging the *players'* moral senses.  The examples I keep using, carry and Unsung, I think are much more clearly designed for this latter goal.  Unsung is the most explicit - gifts come from what the *players* think would make for tough choices.  In that case, no, there's no way you could run a game that ignored the view of the contemporary people playing it - *by design.*  But, again, the anti-war/anti-Vietnam sentiment there is in the players, not the game.  And then you can't get rid of players' views on Vietnam.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I feel like there's not much more conversation to be had on the game side of things.  If your desiderata are:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The game shall be about Vietnam<br/>\n- The game shall be a "story game" in the sense that it engages *players'* moral senses<br/>\n- The game shall not end up being a story that challenges or deeply questions the validity of the war aims in Vietnam<br/>\n<br/>\nthen there's one solution.  Play any story game (in that sense) you like, but you're going to need *players* who share your views about Vietnam before they sit down.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdited to fix HTML and to add: Oh, and I think I'm responsible for the idea that no one questions the justice of WWII.  What I meant to say was that the dominant view, unlike in Vietnam, is that it was just and everyone who fought in it was The Greatest Generation.  So, it's a good contrast case for whether merely raising questions about the justice of war makes the game "anti-war."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252571/#Comment_252571" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T10:33:11+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 10:33AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think any game where:<br/>1) You're not allowed to ask a moral question.<br/>or<br/>2) The question you're going to ask already has a pre-answer in the game text.<br/><br/>Is not really a story game in any tangible sense.

I tend to introduce ideas and let people hash them out amongst themselves while I read along and take mental notes.  This one required a little bit more nerf-herding.<br/><br/>Anyway, I never said this game would have to be strictly realistic or even historically accurate, though that's not exactly the diametric opposite of what I'm positing at the head of the discussion.  What I suggested was the idea that we can't use games like <i>carry</i> to tell a story that contravenes a specific narrative about the war because it subverts the author's intentions.  Rightly or wrongly, there is a popular notion of what the conflict in Vietnam was.  I argue that it wasn't as bleak as all that, while someone like Oliver Stone would strongly disagree with me.  From a certain standpoint he's got one up on me and John Wayne, having been there, but he's still only one guy.\n<blockquote>An additional point: you note that no one doubted the rightness of WW II, but this is not exactly true.</blockquote>\nI should say in my own defense that I never used the past tense.  I have only referred to the idea of WWII held today, not 60+ years ago.\n<blockquote>Thus: today we can tell stories about World War II that ignore pacifist and isolationist sentiment, because there is a general consensus as to the justice of the war. We can't tell the same sorts of stories about Vietnam, because the same sort of consensus doesn't exist.</blockquote>\nExactly, and that's why I said at the outset of all this: how can we tell a different kind of Vietnam story, one that uses the latest story-gaming tools but doesn't view the war as a pool of soul-corrosive acid?  Yes, I can break out <i>Recon</i> or <i>Merc</i> or even <i>Battleforce Bravo</i>, but I'm not getting the same interaction of story and system that someone playing <i>carry</i> does.  And if I don't want to engage in a kind of masochistic anti-American exercise, how can that be done?<br/><br/>So to recap: this isn't a discussion of the rightness or wrongness of the Vietnam War, however I might approach it personally.   I had a father and an uncle who served in Vietnam and I've had my perspective shaped by their experience.  And maybe it was a mistake for me to mention my own feelings on the subject, as it seems to have opened up a tangent that would be better off squelched.<br/><br/>My initial questions revolved around how to tell this story without dropping into a remake of <i>Platoon</i> and if it was even possible to do so.  Now I wonder if it's possible to have a <i>discussion</i> about the <i>possibility</i> of such a game without it devolving into an argument about how and why a war was waged forty years ago.<br/><br/>One final note as to my use of the term "warfighter": <a href="http://www.army.mil/features/WhoIsTheWarfighter/default.html" rel="nofollow">Who is the Warfighter?</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252577/#Comment_252577" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T11:08:30+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 11:08AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And I don't know about anyone else, but the way this discussion is displaying now is <i>seriously</i> messed up.<br/><br/><i>We broke the forum with our arguing!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252578/#Comment_252578" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T11:08:56+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 11:08AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel Levine</cite>You could approach a game as a kind of "morality sim."  In this case, I think it is entirely possible to have a game that is about Vietnam and doesn't fully acknowledge the socio-political context.  You could just have a game that was basically about, "what if I were some green beret who cared about the mission but had to make hard choices, and didn't have 50 years of hindsight and context to draw on?  What would my guy do?"</blockquote>\nOkay, granted. But to a certain degree those hard choices will be informed by the socio-political context,  not least in that you'll be making decisions about and promises to people in the game whose full import can only be appreciated (in your position as audience to your own play) in that context. So when the little orphaned Vietnamese boy asks you, "What will I do now?" and you put your arm around his shoulder and say, "You let me worry about that. You're what this war is all about," (like John Wayne does in the movie) in order to reassure him in-game, the ultimate failure of that implicit promise on a larger scale is part and parcel of your action. And even without that sort of dramatic irony, your Green Beret A Team leader is going to be confronted with choices whose pointedness will emerge from disconnects between the situation on the ground and the larger geopolitical reality: "We need to evacuate these people now! The VC will kill them!" "I'm sorry, Captain, but the public would go nuts if they thought we were abandoning this region to the enemy."<br/><br/>But I guess there's acknowledging the socio-political context and then there's acknowledging the socio-political context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252579/#Comment_252579" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T11:11:37+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 11:11AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, re: forum display -- What the hell!?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252580/#Comment_252580" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T11:14:55+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 11:14AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>JD is the resident curmudgeony banner carrier for the notion that any game can be considered a story-game if once upon a time someone successfully managed to actually tell a story using it.</blockquote>\nI don't know whether my definition is correct, he said modestly, only that everyone else's definition is insane and wrong beyond the imagination of man.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252584/#Comment_252584" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T11:31:09+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 11:31AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Requisite "forum display, WTF?": Forum display, WTF?<br/><br/>- Re: Sam.  I will just reiterate that I think the problem is that one of the "latest story-gaming tools," at least IMHO, is designing games to engage players' moral perspectives directly, rather than as a mechanically unsupported add-on to a system basically trying to do something like simulate in-game reality.  I think you can't use those tools to do what you want if you have a table full of players who are going to want to engage with Vietnam as a tragedy.  <br/><br/>- Re: Bill and Morality Simulation: I don't disagree with you.  But you could run a game which, in the game, was pretty oblivious to bigger concerns.  For instance, I think of the movie Black Hawk Down.  To me, someone with some degree of knowledge about Somalia, it strikes a bit differently than to someone who just knows that Somalia is a place where, like, some Africans killed some Americans.  But the movie makes sense and is a genuine story with conflicts, etc. even if you're ignorant of the context.  Any soldier promising a kid that he'll make sure he has a good life will/should be facing the question of whether he, personally, can assure that - even if the war was totally just and awesome.  <br/><br/>Yes, there will inevitably be dramatic irony.  But if what Sam is talking about is not only keeping discussions of the morality of Vietnam out of the game, but OUT OF PLAYERS' MINDS ENTIRELY then I think the goal is insane and impossible and probably uncharitable to attribute to him.  I mean, I play in a D&amp;D game and am, gleefully, the first person to suggest killing everything we see even though in real life I'm probably one cute Quaker girl flirting with me away from being a pacifist.  There's some dramatic irony for me in that - I play my bloodthirsty character in part to revel in the moral incoherency of the D&amp;D world.  But mostly because some times it's fun to tell power fantasies about solving everything with whup-ass.  Dramatic irony is inevitable, but you can have a game where that's part of the players' private worlds, and doesn't really enter into the story much.<br/><br/>Your point about media, etc. is different, I think, but still leaves the basic point intact.  What challenges the PCs face will be shaped by players' views, sure.  But you could pretty well run a "morality sim" kind of game where you included mostly stuff that seemed likely, without engaging directly much with out-of-character moral sensibilities, I think.  Consider the difference between a game about Iraq where you have to deal with an embedded journalist with an agenda versus one in which every week the GM throws an embedded journalist with an agenda at you - I think the latter would be a very different beast than the former.  I suspect I'm not articulating this point well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252587/#Comment_252587" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T11:34:06+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 11:34AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2010 11:37AM by droog.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite><br/>I do love a nice, substantive contribution to a thread, don't you?</blockquote>\nSuck on it.

Like you, I don't think that's at all possible.<br/><br/>And it may turn out that a key portion of my initial post may be in error.  Working backward from the text of <i>carry</i>, I got the impression that the game was meant to evoke something similar to <i>The Things They Carried</i> and <i>Platoon</i>, both things that have a decidedly negative view of the war.  If it turns out I was wrong about that and <i>carry</i> actually does allow for a broader interpretation then maybe I'm complaining about nothing.<br/><br/>I think it might also be valuable for me to define what I mean when I say "story game."  When I think of that term, I think of a game that models story, not physics.  So <i>carry</i> qualifies, but <i>Recon</i> does not.  Certainly <i>Recon</i> can be used to tell stories (I've done it), but that's not its primary design function.  In its case specifically, it's about weapon handling and combat situations and stuff that has its place <i>within</i> a story told about war, but isn't the <i>story</i>.<br/><br/>So it may be that we're all operating on different levels here and that would account for the disconnect.

I think a lot of people in this thread find Sam's ideological position fundamentally at odds with reality. I'll note that there's a difference between saying "Fuck you" and making an argument, which is how I read the horrific and sadly emblematic images of Vietnam you posted. For most of us, they should act as reminders of why we find Sam's idea of story-gaming the "positive side" of the Vietnam conflict so flabbergasting. Like most enthymemes, however, their force relies on the hearer's agreement with an unspoken premise, in this case that any action that produces images of such horrible and dehumanizing consequences must be immoral. It's not clear that Sam wants to agree with that premise, invested as he is in valorizing the patriotic warfighters of the U.S. armed forces. For Sam, your images may just be part of the "dominant narrative" that corrodes the positive and patriotic conception he wants to be able to stick with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252693/#Comment_252693" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T15:52:39+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  3:52PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel" \u2013 Samuel Johnson<br/><br/>"Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious." \u2013 Oscar Wilde<br/><br/>\u201cPatriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons.\u201d \u2013 Bertrand Russell<br/><br/>\u201cYou're not supposed to be so blind with patriotism that you can't face reality.

Jeff's right; I'm ashamed of my participation in this thread.<br/><br/>We left off having a serious conversation about how to set a game in Vietnam a while ago.  Several of us have suggested that someone who thought Vietnam was justified could perfectly well play a game like carry without being oppressed by the dominant narrative (there's a whole 'nother conversation to be had about how, at least in the US, pro-war revisionists and right-wing Christians come to see themselves as minorities persecuted by powerful, well-connected academics like myself).  That could have been the end of the conversation with someone who thought Vietnam was justified but was willing to seriously face up to the costs of that, or any, war.  You could spin a fantastically interesting game of "even now" stories out of thinking about the brutalities committed in the name of justice, even *real* justice.  But, Sam, you've resolutely opposed such solutions, with the clearest statement of why being that you started the thread with a certain premise and were going to stick with it.  Haven't we gotten beyond "my guy" roleplaying in this age of the latest storygame technology?<br/><br/>Black Hawk Down was, I would and have argued, a profoundly immoral movie precisely for doing what I've been politely offering suggestions on how to do - tell a story about war that's carefully separated from any broader context or concern with the costs to the "other side."  If we take our medium at all seriously, we should take seriously that you can do wrong things with it.  I've mostly not been engaging with your substantive views, Sam, because if you cornered me at a party and started spouting nonsense like that it was the North Vietnamese who created the Khmer Rouge, I would excuse myself as quickly as possible.  And I shouldn't have engaged in the practice of trying to help you do that more subtly.  <br/><br/>I would eagerly play a game with someone whose views about a war or war in general differed from mine, on the condition that it was an honest game, where we could grapple with the moral committments that divide us.  But a game that pretends to engage morally, but only to explore the noble sacrifices of those holding the guns, isn't a story. It's war porn.  And if I'm going to put up with the bad acting in porn, I prefer the other kind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252700/#Comment_252700" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T16:30:18+00:00" title="January 25, 2010  4:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2010 4:31PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniel Levine</cite>Black Hawk Down was, I would and have argued, a profoundly immoral movie precisely for doing what I've been politely offering suggestions on how to do - tell a story about war that's carefully separated from any broader context or concern with the costs to the "other side."

As it is, I could imagine myself playing a game of Shell Shock about the 29th Infantry Division making an assault on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach#Plan_of_attack" rel="nofollow">Omaha Beach</a>.  Although the original objectives of the assault were met in the days following the assault, casualties were very high because some major errors made in planning and preparation.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that I could get both a heroic and an anti-war kind of game from that setup. And in my opinion what I would get would depend on the players, not the game. I bet I could find more than enough players willing to explore questions like "was it worth it, was it right to demand that from them? Are the leaders to blame?" via the game. On the other hand the same game could be about asking questions like "what kept them going?". Maybe both in the same game.<br/><br/>If you cannot get the same from Vietnam, I wouldn't blame the games. That said, I think I could find me a group of players to play Nazi German soldiers in Stalingrad (anyone seen the German film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108211/" rel="nofollow">Stalingrad</a>?) and give them a fair treatment. Not nazi pro-war propaganda, no, but portrayal of complete characters with conflicting interests. But I have a hunch that you are not looking for a fair treatment but something more "refined". And I have to say I don't think there's any other way to go about that than finding some like-minded players. Not many of them on Story Games by the look of it, but good luck anyway.<br/><br/>I will give you one more suggestion (a bit tongue in cheek this one, though): Have you tried adding some distance to the popular narrative? How about doing the setting you want in fantasy: the alliance of free peoples against a powerful evil that has to be stopped. Most of the moral dilemmas could be eradicated by portraying the enemy as inhuman.

For example, I never suggested that the Vietnamese Communists <i>created</i> the Khmer Rouge, only that there was a definite connection between the fall of South Vietnam and the eventual fall of the non-communist government of Cambodia.  I didn't go into a lot of detail on the subject at the time because I didn't feel it was important enough to merit extensive explanation.  And I still don't, as it's outside the scope of the discussion.<br/><br/>Like Alexandre, I'm glad you took the time to participate and didn't leave even when I poked fun at you for having a Ph.D.  That was my envy peeking through and it wasn't a very good joke, anyway.<br/><br/>Back on the subject at hand, I think you actually hit upon the only way a <i>Green Berets</i>-style game could be played.  It's likely not a manner of mechanics, but of making sure every player is on the same page before sitting down to game.  Just as we had our <i>Green Berets</i>-style games in the '80s because we were all committed to a certain narrative, the same would be needed now.<br/><br/>I still think it would be an interesting exercise to try and use a game that would mechanically reflect on story, but as you've suggested <i>carry</i> might very well work in this way as long as (once again) everyone's working from the same basic premise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252754/#Comment_252754" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T04:00:24+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  4:00AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By the way, I'm <i>very</i> glad that whatever freakout the forum software had has been resolved on this page.

Not nazi pro-war propaganda, no, but portrayal of complete characters with conflicting interests. But I have a hunch that you are not looking for a fair treatment but something more "refined". And I have to say I don't think there's any other way to go about that than finding some like-minded players. Not many of them on Story Games by the look of it, but good luck anyway.</blockquote>\nAntti, I think you're right that it's not the game, but the player base.  As I said to Daniel above, if you have a group of people who can proceed from the game's base assumption then you can have a proper, <i>Green Berets</i>-style game.  Otherwise you're inevitably going to have someone who goes off at 90 degrees to that and breaks the game, at least as far as its intention.<br/><br/>Not to get too far off on a tangent, but <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11023" rel="nofollow">I have wondered</a> how well a game would go that asked the players to assume the roles of German soldiers.  Maybe not Nazis, but possibly including them.  How would that color the roleplay and how successful would the game be in fulfilling its goals, whatever those might be?  Questions like that intrigue me, just like the ones that started this whole thread.<br/><br/>Coming back to the subject: I posited this whole thing as something of a thought experiment.  I doubt that it'd be possible to get even two players together who still hold their Cold War mindsets regarding anti-Communist military intervention and US activism abroad \u2014 which would include, but is not limited to Vietnam.  It's not just a matter of finding people through Story Games, but in the gamer pool at large.<br/><br/>We've come such a long way and deviated from the initial purpose of the thread so much that it might do to have a reminder at this point exactly what I was asking in the first place:\n<blockquote>How do we go about telling a story like <i>The Green Berets</i>? Where's the story game that allows for a positive approach to America's most unpopular war.  What do we do? Does this really call for an entirely new system with mechanisms in place to encourage positive messages? And is it even possible to do so?</blockquote>\nAnyway, you asked about taking the Vietnam setting and reconfiguring it under a new genre.  <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11203" rel="nofollow">I actually have considered this</a> and I wonder how it would go over with a player base that would otherwise be adamantly opposed to a Vietnam scenario.  As someone pointed out in that other thread, it would be easy enough to posit a guerrilla war against the swamp elves and chances are good no one would be the wiser.  They would carry out a <i>Green Berets</i> scenario without batting an eyelash.<br/><br/>Of course there might be the occasional sharp player who notes the parallels and deliberately tries to subvert the paradigm, but I'm willing to lay odds that if the premise is laid out subtly enough there would be irony-free, fantasy-Commie-killing galore going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252767/#Comment_252767" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T05:22:11+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  5:22AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>Hey, Jeff, you're right to be angry.</blockquote>\nI think we'll have to agree to disagree on that.  There's nothing keeping Jeff on the thread except what appears to be an impulse to hurl personal insults and vulgarity.\n<blockquote>I think a lot of people in this thread find Sam's ideological position fundamentally at odds with reality.</blockquote>\nI will freely admit that the Vietnam War is not my particular area, and that my position vis-\xe0-vis the war is colored both by my age and my personal connection to the men who fought there.  But I have never argued that the war was not an ugly bit of business.  If Jeff wanted to be fair, he would post images of suffering in the aftermath of the bombing of Dresden or of villagers killed and maimed by the Viet Cong.  Unfortunately those images don't exist, aside from a few images of buildings decimated by bombing, but that doesn't mean the suffering is any less real.<br/><br/>If you want to talk about obscentity, then I'll refer to you to Holocaust study, which is what I used to do before getting into writing full-time.  \n<blockquote>I'll note that there's a difference between saying "Fuck you" and making an argument, which is how I read the horrific and sadly emblematic images of Vietnam you posted. For most of us, they should act as reminders of why we find Sam's idea of story-gaming the "positive side" of the Vietnam conflict so flabbergasting. Like most enthymemes, however, their force relies on the hearer's agreement with an unspoken premise, in this case that any action that produces images of such horrible and dehumanizing consequences must be immoral.</blockquote>\nThank you for pointing out that hurling invective is not participating in a debate.  Not that this thread was intended as a debate on the relative merits or lack thereof of the Vietnam War, regardless of how the discussion has developed.<br/><br/>The problem with positing that such images immediately brand the war as immoral is that <i>any</i> war has horrific images associated with it.  Does that mean all war is immoral?  Certainly some would argue that and I wouldn't presume to disagree with them, largely because it's an argument that has no bearing on whether wars will be fought.  Wars <i>will</i> be fought and no amount of philosophical hand-wringing will make a difference one way or another.  Maybe that's something of an existentialist statement, that an outcome is inevitable irrespective of choice, but there it is.\n<blockquote>It's not clear that Sam wants to agree with that premise, invested as he is in valorizing the patriotic warfighters of the U.S. armed forces. For Sam, your images may just be part of the "dominant narrative" that corrodes the positive and patriotic conception he wants to be able to stick with.</blockquote>\nI won't say that those images are part of the narrative I describe because they aren't subject to interpretation.  Seeing a naked girl fleeing a bombing raid is horrifying.  Seeing a man being executed is horrifying.  Seeing planes spraying Agent Orange is... well, not horrifying and the pictures of deformed children could be from any time and are likely unrelated to the Vietnam War, though they are disturbing in the way that all deformity is considered disturbing.<br/><br/>The narrative to which I refer is the one that emphasizes only the negative aspects of the war and our participation in it.  This narrative leaves no room for those who found our cause there just, for the soldiers who laid down their lives courageously and the story of any person who was not emotionally or physically crippled by their participation in the war.  It's fundamentally dishonest to look at Vietnam and say (for example) that all our soldiers were disillusioned, drug-using conscripts and all our actions in the war were unjustified or failures.  It's also fundamentally dishonest to deny that there <i>is</i> a popular narrative of the Vietnam War because there clearly is, and the less someone knows about the war the more likely they are to refer to that narrative as a substitute for familiarity.<br/><br/>Now.  As I've said multiple times before, a debate over the Vietnam War's causes, conduct and ultimate justification (or lack thereof) is beyond the scope of this discussion.  I pointed out in a response above the questions that I asked at the start of this mess \u2014 which is a quagmire of its own, sadly \u2014 which have been addressed off and on through out the 80+ posts made so far.  I'd like to make an appeal for things to either get back on track or just let the subject peter off and die.  I have plenty of other discussions that could generate thoughtful discussion that lack the hot-button topic of Vietnam.

Just note: At that point, you're basically playing what is traditionally a WWII story, but with slightly different guns and uniforms and slightly different asians.<br/><br/>Looking into Vietnam for heroics is... well, it's different. You'll have to therefore go in different directions (or else use Recon, as JD suggested above: I played it in Junior High School with about as much knowledge of the war as any other kid in JHS, it was a solid game I remember). It's like wanting to tell heroic stories about WWII from the Nazi army. "But hey, not stories of people who actually wanted to be in the army to kill gays and jews for Hitler, just conscripted men who believed they were staving off threats to their homes, who performed admirably despite the fucked up situation they were in". If you really want to play Heroic Nazis, asking about how to go about that online will generate bafflement and ire in people, but so be it if that's what you really want (there were some <a href="http://www.badassoftheweek.com/wittman.html" rel="nofollow">heroic stories that had nothing to do with Hitler</a> in that era, mind, but still...).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252812/#Comment_252812" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T08:52:28+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  8:52AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2010 8:53AM by Andy.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, re forum display on page one: I fixed Daniel's post: there was a  tag with no referring tag.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252816/#Comment_252816" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T09:03:26+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  9:03AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

It was GenCon, Saturday I think, in the afternoon. Everyone's brains were a little fried, and so we approached carry without much ideological leaning. We played the brief story of young men far from home who were up against an enemy they couldn't effectively fight, but they were fighting anyway. The session started with a bloody ambush along a river, machine guns taking out a number of men. We eventually made it back to camp where the ostensible relief of relative safety was broken by personal battles over drugs, duty, and honor. Knives went to throats. The game ended with the characters marching off on patrol again. (I can't accurately remember our epilogues.)<br/><br/>The game certainly didn't tell us the war was wrong. It did tell us that it was hard for these people to be there, fighting. I think this may be your sticking point with the game: it doesn't actually say anything about the war, it says a lot about the people in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252930/#Comment_252930" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T14:49:27+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  2:49PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>Not that you can tell.</blockquote>\nPlease, let's keep that sort of thing either in Whispers, or just Off The Board.<br/><br/>Thanks-<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252934/#Comment_252934" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T15:00:44+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  3:00PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey this is my second direct exposure to armchair historical revisionism.

Most of the systems are concerned with unit cohesion and friendship and it's definitely a dirty hippy indie game.<br/><br/>This reminds me of a fascinating critique of the Vietnam (and Iraq II) War; that, lacking an overarching mission they could really cleave to, soldiers fought only for one another. The argument goes on to say that that makes atrocity more likely, because if all you have to fight for is your friend, and your friend dies, there's no reason not to be really vicious with the killers. That would seem to endanger  <i>Combat Diaries</i>, if that argument is as true as it feels to me, as a neutral look at war.<br/><br/>But, finally, war is about killing people. I don't believe anything psychologically interesting or realistic can come out of a game that wants to ignore the damage done to one by the act of killing another human.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253235/#Comment_253235" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T13:37:15+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  1:37PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I don't believe anything psychologically interesting or realistic can come out of a game that wants to ignore the damage done to one by the act of killing another human.</blockquote>\nThankfully that's <i>not</i> what I have suggested at any point in this discussion.  If I had, I think I'd be trying to shout me down, too.<br/><br/>If I had it all to do over again, I would have phrased my point as this: what kind of Vietnam game would we have if we switched the polarity of a core question (justification) from <i>unjustified</i> to <i>justified</i>?  What happens then?  And is that even possible to do, given the general impression people have of the war and its conduct?<br/><br/>Once we get down to actually answering <i>those questions</i> rather than arguing about the rightness or wrongness of war in general or a particular war or wars specifically, I think we'll finally have something worth the time it takes to read through all these posts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253249/#Comment_253249" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T13:51:06+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  1:51PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the couple times I've played <i>carry</i>, the question of justification wasn't important.

It sounds like the former, which tells me a lot about how a game would<i>actually</i>play out, as opposed to my perception.It's been a good while since I've played this game, so my memory of the events may be flawed.  With that said, in the times that I've played, the GM was confronting us with the baggage we brought into the war with us.  This would lead to friction between the characters, and the players would have to decide between unit cohesion and dealing with their baggage.  So, ultimately, it depended on how the players want the story to play out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P

My impression of the rules was that players would be confronted with situations that reflected their characters' experiences against this bleak and hopeless war.  Now I see that was either: 1) indicative my own perspective going in, or 2) entirely dependent on the conduct of the individual GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Hearkening all the way back to the original post, I asked if <i>carry</i> told X kind of story, then how do we tell Y kind of story?  It wasn't meant to be a referendum on the game, but a question of telling a specific kind of Vietnam story that I perceived as being outside the scope of Paoletta's game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253705/#Comment_253705" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T09:23:11+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  9:23AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, but this conversation is kinda circling now.

I'll run it the way I always run it, and you can come back here and talk about <i>that specific play instance</i> and how it supports or doesn't support a certain kind of play.

Nothing psychologically interesting or realistic comes out of them.<br/><br/>But that's just me.<br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD: But interestingly, note that in order to make killing "something that just happens," your first step requires you to turn the killing into something other than "the act of killing another <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">human</span> person" by creating the non-person. Orcs, goblins and other monsters descend from the portrayal of Muslims during the Crusades by the Church, as people whom you don't have to worry about as persons. You can kill them, and it doesn't count as murder, because they don't count as persons. So, at their very best, such games can have psychologically interesting or realistic points about completely other topics, because on this point, they help you exercise your ability to deny the personhood evident in another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11315/a-different-kind-of-vietnam-story/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11315/a-different-kind-of-vietnam-story">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11315/a-different-kind-of-vietnam-story/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11315/a-different-kind-of-vietnam-story/p3">3</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11315%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11315%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
