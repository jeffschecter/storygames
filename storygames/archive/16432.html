I've had success in the past with the Murder A La Carte series, but want to ditch the recorded investigator sections and the pre-writtenscript. Given a comment in the intersection between Larp and Tabletop thread, I thought that a live action lite adapation of A Taste for Murder might fit the bill.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone tried this?<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven the game-averse nature of the guests, I don't want to use dice.

It'd be a record of the game, too. It'd be fun.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking of having a 'family tree' portrait in this kind of style:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.whitesphotography.com/images/Family_Tree.JPG" rel="nofollow">Family Tree</a><br/>\nWith some additional slots for staff and other non-family members.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then put the players' pictures and character names in there either in advance or using polaroids as they come in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a flipchart would be useful when it comes to keeping everyone's revealed motives straight (and perhaps it could even be officially called the 'investigator's notebook') and to be a focal point for the second half.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the ideas on conflict resolutions. Reading through them gave me another idea: play out the pair scene live, when one character makes a demand of the other, the other either accepts the demand or tries to reject it ('say yes or roll the dice'). If they wish to reject it, they reach for a cigarette box and offer the demanding character a cigarette.<br/>\n<br/>\nInside the box are a bunch of Archipelago style resolutions written on small pieces of paper and rolled into tubes. If the demanding character wishes to proceed, they take a 'cigarette', share the resolution with the other player (perhaps while making chit-chat around 'lighting the cigarette') and the two finish the scene accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would integrate the resolution relatively naturally in the scene, but yet still be a clear 'meta' signal for both characters to break conversational deadlocks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377247/#Comment_377247" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T23:33:02+00:00" title="May  8, 2012 11:33PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Richard, if you ever get to play this, I'd love to hear more!

One of the benefits of being in rehearsal is that you can tell your actors where to go and what to do and - so long as you provide food or alcohol - there are no arguments about games they'd prefer to play as they believe it's all a theatrical exercise to create a devised murder mystery.<br><br>My last consideration (aside from the menu) is whether there should be a mechanical benefit from a successful influence in the first half. I'm pretty confident that they'll do it anyway to gain their character an in-game benefit - as there's nothing else for their characters to do. I was considering, though, that a 1st half successful influence might give them a token that would give them narrative rights to define a motive-level of the character they won it from when the defeated character is successfully investigated in the 2nd half.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385846/#Comment_385846" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-26T20:00:23+00:00" title="July 26, 2012  8:00PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So A Live Taste for Murder went off and fun and death was had by all (though I'm happy to to acknowledge the alcohol's contribution to the fun part).<br><br>This was what confronted the participants when they arrived:<br><img alt="image" src="http://www.richard-williams.com/murder_start.jpg"/><br><br>I'd taken period(-ish) photo-portraits of the players at the previous rehearsal  and printed them out along with an A1 size 'family tree'. Their first task was to assign themselves a role in the family and put their portraits on the appropriate place on the tree. I'd kicked off with putting myself on as an example:<br><img alt="image" src="http://www.richard-williams.com/murder_1tree.jpg"/><br><br>I put the rules up on the wall and to one side we had a couple of cigarette cases. One containing pieces of paper with different rooms of the house, the other containing the 'resolution cigarettes'. <br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.richard-williams.com/murder_cigarettes.jpg"/><br/>The basic idea being:<br/>1) on their turn, the active player nominated another character they wanted something from<br/>2) the defending player picks a room slip at random, reads it out and starts the scene in that location<br/>3) the active player enters, plays out the scene<br/>4) when it becomes obvious what they want, the defender either gives it or offers a cigarette.<br/>5) the instructions on the cigarette then resolve the scene<br/><br/>I also got them together to brainstorm possible generic motives for murder for use in the second half.<br/><br/>So, the completed tree looked like this:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.richard-williams.com/murder_tree.jpg"/><br/><br/>And then (after a first course and about an hour of socialising) we went into the first half. <br/><br/>Everyone had two slips of paper with their character's name on them (which I called motive slips). If someone got something from them as part of a scene, they gave them a slip.<br/><br/>At the end of the first half, there was a terrible murder... in fact I was counting votes, there was a tie, and so there were two! The designated players keeled over after the main course for dramatic effect, however when they returned as investigators I allowed them to narrate the true circumstances of their deaths.<br/><br/>I rearranged the board to put the victims at the bottom and the suspects and their motive levels at the top.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.richard-williams.com/murder_motives.jpg"/><br/><br/>Then we played out the second half with everyone investigating each other. The twists were that, if someone was successfully investigated, they could sacrifice one of the motive slips they'd earnt during the first half to reveal a motive level for that other character (and thereby deflect the investigation from them). We used the generic motive suggestions from the beginning (in yet another cigarette box) to help inspire.<br/><br/>One character quickly filled up, and then the motives were spread around a little more until finally a second one hit the third level. Then we had a vote... appropriately enough another tie and as they finished the dessert the dastardly murderers revealed the terrible truth.<br/><br/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385847/#Comment_385847" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-26T20:00:50+00:00" title="July 26, 2012  8:00PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2012 10:21PM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>What could have been improved upon?</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Player rule blind-spots</span><br/>There were certain things that the players couldn't appear to remember, no matter how many times we did them - though perhaps the increasing levels of alcohol offset the experience as the evening progressed - including:<br/><br/>- that the defending player picks the location - they never remembered this<br/><br/>- when to offer a resolution cigarette - they almost always had to be prompted here, again it's something the defender has to do, so in the future I'd give the attacker a physical cue first (as in the actual A Taste for Murder) or perhaps switch the perspective of the cigarettes so that they're offered by the attacker. <br/><br/>- moving the motive slips - though they did get the hang of this before the end of the first half<br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The resolution cigarettes</span><br/>The cigarettes fulfilled their primary function of resolving scenes, but improvements were needed<br/>- As just mentioned, I should revert to the original game and make it an attacker cue rather than a defender cue<br/>- I made them up about an hour before the game began. As I was using regular paper, I folded them several times to get them to stay in the appropriate shape. Unfortunately this led to each scene pausing for about five flow-breaking seconds as the player unfolded them to find out the resolution and then showed them to the other player. In the future, and with more time, I'd go for a colour-coded approach as Graham suggested above or 'draw the short straw' style or something that would let the players know instantly how the scene should be resolved.<br/>- in order to encourage players to demand something of others, I weighted the cigarettes towards success (my categories were Success, Lose Bad, Negotiate, Need Help). By sheer luck, the players avoided almost all the few negative ones in there - even though we were discarding the successes as we picked them - so it appeared even more skewed. In the future I'd probably go for more of a 50/50 split. <br/> <br/>On the positive side, the incongruity of the constant offering back and forth of cigarettes became another source of humour that built throughout the game, culminating in an ash-ridden scene in the Queen Mary Smoking Room.<br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The generic motive inspirations</span><br/>I put these in as an afterthought as I feared that the players might dry when they had to come up with a motive level for another character. In truth, these weren't necessary. The players had built up such a wide range of motives in the first half alone that the generic motive inspirations just got in the way... until one was drawn near the end that put a final gloriously sick twist on the situation... Maybe they'd be more necessary with a group of strangers. My players had been working together for seven weeks on a show so were pretty comfortable with each other.<br/><br/><br/><b>And what worked well?</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The family tree</span><br/>Having a pretty young crowd, and with the first two arrivals casting themselves as daughters, I feared we'd end up with a 'family' made up of a single generation (which is not necessarily a problem). But with the physical space of the family tree, the players instinctively tried to fill the gaps at the top and so we ended up with a nice even spread.<br/><br/>The tree was also a good reference point as the players tried to keep their various relationships straight.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The room slips</span><br/>The locations didn't add a great deal, but they definitely added some differentiation between the scenes. The players gave each scene a unique spin depending on where they were, whether it was the Potting Shed, the Bowling Green, the Queen Victoria Boudoir, the Grand Portico or the Chapel of St. Hubbins. The Edward the Eighth Lower Dining Room deserves a special mention as, upon reading it, the starting player decided to take the description literally and assumed that it was called the Lower Dining Room because the ceiling was very low (think Being John Malkovich low) and the scene was played out hunched over as a result.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The live action element</span><br/>As noted at the beginning of this thread, A Taste for Murder lends itself very easily to live action in any case. The genre is such that, even in the movies, the vast majority of scenes are people standing in a room talking (with perhaps a brief scuffle and chase with the culprit at the end to confirm their guilt). But standing up (or crouching down as in the Lower Dining Room) did inject more life into the scene - and it also helped focus the active players on one another.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Passing the motive slips</span><br/>The motive slips - the 'currency' of the game - were essentially narrative rights over a motive level. The first half was built to mix the motive slips amongst the different players. Now, this is a bit of a break from the actual A Taste for Murder where each player has complete control over the details of their increasingly sinister relationship with the victim so YMMV. I found it quite natural, though, to have suspects under pressure reveal secrets about other family members to deflect the investigation into their own private lives. <br/><br/>There are several the motive slip 'economy' could get out of control, so put certain controls in place which (mostly) prevented it.<br/><br/><br/>The resulting story, while horribly overblown, was pretty funny. There's too much to go into in detail, but some highlights were:<br/><br/>- the long lost uncle who'd come back from South Africa where he'd been mining coal (bit of a mix-up over forms of carbon there) to unravel the death of his brother Marmaduke who'd died in a bizarre sewing accident<br/><br/>- the mad aunt who'd written a Fifty Shades style erotic novel and who tried to get it published under the housekeeper's name, who then blackmailed her with the real-life incidents on which it was based<br/><br/>- the revelation that said aunt was a cold-blooded killer, trained in the secret family tradition of making deaths look like sewing accidents<br/><br/>- the murder of the eldest daughter who died of having drunk poisoned wine whilst practicing for a car race, in a car where the breaks had been cut, and with a booby-trapped sewing machine in her lap<br/><br/>- the murder of the housekeeper by poison in her bedroom where the evidence indicated that she'd recently been enjoying the attentions of two men simultaneously<br/><br/>- and the final slew of revelations wherein it was revealed that the eldest daughter was the offspring of an affair between the husband and the housekeeper, and that the youngest daughter/brat was in fact the offspring of the eldest daughter and the NPC the Baron von Otter - with whom, the brat was in a love triangle with her elder sister/mother.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
