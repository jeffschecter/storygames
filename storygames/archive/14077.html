This helps players create three-dimensional characters with ambitions, weaknesses, obsessions and desires. Because you earn XP for specific actions, the audience learns about characters in a "show, don't tell" way. I think that's essential in a visual medium - to not describe a character's traits, but to prove them through their actions. Finally, you get XP (10!) by buying off your Key, which creates an awesome character arc: demonstrate who the character is, put stress on that character, witness them transform under that stress.<br/><br/>Another part of it is gift dice. There are moments in most Hollywood movies where you know that there's absolutely no way that the hero will manage to complete their task, but you root for them anyways, and they somehow manage to squeak through. Gift dice are a mechanic that echo that.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318488/#Comment_318488" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-02T16:05:28+00:00" title="April  2, 2011  4:05PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cam, do you mean games that emulate the visual and narrative style of blockbusters or the form and structure of them?<br/><br/>Because, as far as I know, aside from a few games like Geiger Counter, Mist-Robed Gate, and Fiasco, there are very few games that are structured to resemble a single movie, meant to be played to completion in 2-3 hours, with character introductions, rising action, climax/twist, and eventual resolution.  Seems like you could definitely make a "ridiculous summer world-saving blockbuster" game in that model.  Jason's Game Chef 2010 game, <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/game_chef/morningstar_danger_mountain_game_chef.pdf" rel="nofollow">Danger Mountain!</a>, is probably a good place to start for something like that.  Another movie-focused game that comes to mind, also from Game Chef 2010, is Mike Olsen's <a href="http://venturehomenews.com/rpg/ActionCity-MikeOlson.pdf" rel="nofollow">Action City!</a>, another game with a bang in its title.<br/><br/>If you're talking about the roleplaying style that is often called "cinematic" -- where does that originally come from anyway? Feng Shui? HKAT? -- then that's something else and I'm less certain how to talk about it.  It has to do with games where the description of actions matters to your success, yeah? Rather than just your raw stats?  It's also the style that gave us "hero points" of various types and other player-authoring techniques, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318495/#Comment_318495" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-02T17:16:04+00:00" title="April  2, 2011  5:16PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We were just playstorming this last night!

I don't have any license in particular in mind; I'm interested in hearing from folks about what they'd expect, or what hurdles people believe exist that need to be overcome. For instance, kobutsu suggests games can't capture this kind of visual medium, but I think there's no reason to think that's the case given the emergent nature of imagination in RPGs in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome great advice so far, though.

This allows a board game to fill my head with plenty of words, models, and rules that inspire a fantastic fight scene from a monster movie. <br><br>Offering solid imagery in an rpg is something that more or less requires a re-think of roleplaying. codification of plot structure, information presentation, resolution, all of it.<br/><br/>or you know just add a deck of critical hit cards, that works to.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318619/#Comment_318619" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-03T20:25:34+00:00" title="April  3, 2011  8:25PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Film creates a visual language for the audience.

Generally they fight 'for something' other than themselves.  Often they are reluctant heroes.<br/><br/>during fights, there are generally a lot of mooks who are spurious noise, and the heroes often end up one on one with the antagonist.  The antagonist often wins the early fights due to 'cheating'<br/><br/>Another trope is "they are the only ones who can see the REAL danger" and have a lot of trouble convincing the dumb schmucks in charge until its too late.<br/><br/>Is that the kind of stuff youre after?<br/><br/>As for system that backs this up, I guess most of the above is down to 'genre'.   A combat system that concentrates less on 'realism' and bean counting and more on imagery would be helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318772/#Comment_318772" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-04T18:31:48+00:00" title="April  4, 2011  6:31PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2011 6:37PM by TylerT.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Been thinking more on this<br/><br/>When I say imagery I need to clarify what I'm talking about. I'm thinking of how words and writing use imagery. but I'm also talking about how systems and rules create their own sort of imagery and physics.<br/><br/>So I'm not really talking about pictures, illustrations, sound effects, or bean bags hurled at high speeds. Though they help quite a bit.<br/><br/>I'm talking about what players put into a system and what it spits out. In many rpgs the players will insert a context and the game will spit out a simple PASS, or FAIL result. It's then up to the game master or hippie to create the imagery for this result. <br/><br/>Systematically these games only offer imagery that helps build the context of the pass or fail check, some games build on this imagery by offering, "attacks" "moves" "talents" ect, These features have little systematic hooks that build the imagery in a player's mind. The resulting effect of a sex move, the AOE template your mage drops and the resulting fire damage that last for a few rounds. These sorts of things are systematic imagery.<br/><br/>a fantastic example are conditions in mouse guard, hungry, angry, tired, injured, sick. have way more imagery then an abstract number like HP-5<br/><br/>Again I will point toward the challenges rpgs face because they are open ended. Systematic feedback is hard to make work in a multitude of situations, if you assign something more specific then \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d it's going to cover fewer situations. <br/><br/>This asks the question. What situations do you cover with the system?  And then leads to \u201cwhat situations are likely in the story I want to tell? This is what I mean by codifying a plot structure.<br/><br/>Can you make \u201cplot\u201d a system? <a href="http://seedrpg.wordpress.com/2010/08/23/how-does-seed-rpg-play-the-plot-card/" rel="nofollow">I think so</a>, I think plot needs to be a system. I use systematic plots in my own game, and I have seen them in plenty of other story games. I write mine a little more specific then most because that makes it easy to plug systems inside of the plot, and helps biuld stronger context for the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
