You can get it <a href="https://weaving-stories.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/fire-swamp-of-whale.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>It's a mash-up of London's Natural History Museum (a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=london+natural+history+museum&amp;t=canonical&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images" rel="nofollow">gorgeous building</a>, if you've never seen it) and the eponymous fire swamp. The whale is the new full <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-X4V8VGHlU0w/WkaC6U7NBnI/AAAAAAAA6aQ/Th9y7vdlh644MiEZBXZCVPpLCoTNB0l3wCLcBGAs/s1600/whale-skeleton.png" rel="nofollow">blue whale skeleton</a> that hangs in the entrance hall, brought to unlife by necromantic power to roam the swamp and eat lizardmen.<br/><br/>More generally, we've really been enjoying playing Breakers - we've played two sessions so far and the mixture of "straight to the action" (from the Dungeon World / PbtA roots), exciting places and intrinsic humour is a great mix for our group.<br/><br/>For the first session I used "<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2015/Edward%20Tirocke%20-%20Sunken%20Spires.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Sunken Spires</a>" by etirocke, jumbled up with London's Tate Modern. This mostly meant that I added a (tongue in cheek) layer of contemporary art over the dungeon, rather than changing its structure: So the hypnotic moths had wings pattern with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian#/media/File:Piet_Mondriaan,_1930_-_Mondrian_Composition_II_in_Red,_Blue,_and_Yellow.jpg" rel="nofollow">Mondrians</a>, etc. It began with a rickety mine lift situated on the Turbine Hall's floor, which is actually somewhat plausible given real exhibits that have been there.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear what you think of the fire swamp, and also to hear about your Breakers' play experiences. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468650/#Comment_468650" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-29T19:32:17+00:00" title="December 29, 2017  7:32PM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've no idea if the dream-like fantasy genre here is because of the scenario or the game, but either way, I love it. In fact, that's totally the sort of scenario I could see running in my 19th century mystery archeology D&amp;D, or my dreamlands D&amp;D. I love how the real interleaves with the fantastic; it's a technique I've worked with myself, I'm slowly converting Helsinki into a fantasy adventure location for my desk drawer.<br/><br/>So yeah, that adventure works for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
