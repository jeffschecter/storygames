On the NPC side, once again the results were narrative; before shooting, the player would describe what they wanted to do to the enemy (aided by various gun mods). A 10+ would kill/maim/bleed/stun/do whatever, reduced by armor. A 7-9 would get a reduced result, result in the player being injured, or incur an additional cost.<br/><br/>After a few playtests, one of the pieces of feedback I got was that the system felt very arbitrary, and that a partial success didn't feel like a success at all. That there was no \u201cpurpose\u201d to the roll, and that ultimately up to the GM\u2019s adjudication/whims. Now, I wasn't\u2019t 100% sure I agreed, and the player in question has the habit of power gaming, so I already had the impression that a more narrative system was not sitting quite right with him. However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the \u201cup close\u201d, over-the-shoulder, round by round action that we had gotten so used to in games like D&amp;D didn't work here, because there were no numbers. Numbers make round-based combat. Even a partial success means that the numbers are going up. <br/><br/>With numbers, a partial success is quantifiable and entirely in the control of the dice. You are always moving towards your goal, and you know what to expect from each situation. Dungeon World bridges the gap by adding damage dice rolls to the Hack and Slash; you know what you\u2019re getting into when you make an attack, you know the \u2018range\u2019 of what the outcome will be in the instance of a success, partial success and failure. In a purely narrative system, where everyone dies at the speed of plot, all it takes is a partial success that has an effect you didn't want (\u201chis armor absorbs the hit, but he\u2019s pushed backwards over the railing\u201d \u201cI didn't want him going over the edge! I wanted to recover the body!\u201d) to feel like your \u2018partial success\u2019 is actually a different kind of total failure.<br/><br/>This has lead me to believe that in 'narrative' combat situations, the camera of the narrative needs to be pulled way back. Not round-to-round, not individual roll per enemy. Instead, it would be a situation that can take minutes or hours in-game to resolve, but turns on one or two rolls. The camera is pulled way up, and the overall thrust of the tactics, motives and goals is resolved by the dice, not the individual kills. Furthermore, the consequences of partial failures would need to be spelled out, to be sure that the player knows the stakes.<br/><br/>So I\u2019m kicking around a new \u201cOpen Fire\u201d move, one that cleaves closer to AW's Take By Force than it does DW's Hack and Slash.<br/><br/>Open Fire (+Mettle)<br/>When you engage opposing forces with firearms, heavy weapons or artillery, describe your goal and tactics then roll +Mettle. On a 10+, you succeed in your goal but choose 1 consequence from the list below. On a 7-9, the GM will choose 2 consequences from the list if you choose to press the attack. <br/>\u2022\tThere are a number of surviving enemies.<br/>\u2022\tThe attack causes significant, undesirable collateral damage.<br/>\u2022\tYou suffer harm during the attack.<br/>\u2022\tYou end up in a difficult, dangerous or disadvantageous position.<br/>\u2022\tAn ally is put in a difficult, dangerous or disadvantageous position.<br/>\u2022\tSomething you own becomes damaged, unusable or expended.<br/><br/>I\u2019m interested in people\u2019s experiences with \u201cpulled out\u201d vs \u201cup close\u201d combat in more narrative games, especially *World games and the like. Can a combat system not use numbers and still feel fair? Should I stop worrying and learn to love the HP (or HP equivalent)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424570/#Comment_424570" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T13:18:23+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  1:18PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds a lot like the thinking behind Burning Wheel's "Bloody Versus" system. In BWG simple combats can be resolved by a single opposed roll with the player and the GM setting the stakes before hand.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424571/#Comment_424571" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T13:20:22+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  1:20PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the move you suggest. It's a great example of how narrative options get coded into moves.<br/><br/>On the other hand, why not simply add the option of choice to the 10+ result of your initial roll, or let the player narrate what they accomplish <i>afterwards</i>? In the example you explain, it sounds like there's a communication gap between the player's stated intent and the "partial success" outcome, because it wasn't a "bad thing, but good thing"--it was, from the player's perspective, "bad thing, but bad thing".<br/><br/>So try something like this...<br/><br/>When you <b>open fire on someone</b>, roll +Mettle and choose a number of options from the following list. On a <b>10+</b>, choose three. On a <b>7-9</b>, choose one.<br/>\u2022 You wound them severely.<br/>\u2022 You accomplish a larger goal, such as driving them back or taking them captive.<br/>\u2022 A nearby ally takes +1 forward to their next move against an enemy.<br/>\u2022 You don't expose yourself to immediate, serious danger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424572/#Comment_424572" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T13:20:59+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  1:20PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see why you think the two issues (numerical vs. story consequences, on the one hand; "up close" vs. "pulled out", on the other) are closely related. But, in my opinion, they don't have to be. You could have fairly up-close combat stressing tactical positioning, wounds of varying degrees of severity, etc. I think the things you'd want to look at if you wanted to build in that direction are the optional firefight rules in AW, and the "Caravan Guards" and "Warriors" games in Sundered Lands. They're still zoomed out relatively speaking, but not QUITE as zoomed out as your <i>open fire</i> move, so they might give you some insight into how to zoom in a little tighter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
