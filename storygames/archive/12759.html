I realized a little while ago that it might be fun to hack this game so you could play it as comic book heroes. I like how In a Wicked Age sets lowly slaves equal to mighty gods and demons in conflicts based on for what they're fighting and how, and it reminded me of how <a href="http://www.seanbaby.com/superfriends/superman.htm" rel="nofollow">Superman</a> and <a href="http://www.seanbaby.com/superfriends/aquaman.htm" rel="nofollow">Aquaman</a> and <a href="http://www.seanbaby.com/superfriends/batman.htm" rel="nofollow">Batman</a> all hang out in the Justice League together for reasons not entirely discernible to me all the time. Moreover, not only do they all have a pretty even shot against the same bad guys (and problems in their personal lives), they have a pretty even shot fighting each other\u2014for example, Superman is 0 and 3 versus Batman, far as I can tell.<br/><br/>So I was thinking In a Wicked Age could become "In a Golden/Silver Age" pretty easily. You could play comic book heroes, or supporting cast, or for a more original IaWA flavor you could be Vertigo-style characters from the pages of Sandman or Swamp Thing. They could all have a Great Power, restricted by a Great Responsibility (okay maybe that's too much). Of course the oracles would take some revision, but that'd be fun, and an excuse to flip through old comic books for ideas.<br/><br/>What do you guys think\u2014any other changes that need to be made? Vincent, you reading this? This idea totally stupid?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/framweard" title="framweard"><img alt="framweard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/framweard">framweard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286877/#Comment_286877" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T21:02:33+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  9:02PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IaWA is commonly hacked for all kinds of zany shit, with nothing but custom Oracles used.

But I did enjoy it while it lasted.)<br/><br/>Do, however, keep hacking IaWA, I'm always fascinated hack a system for another setting. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286886/#Comment_286886" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T22:06:12+00:00" title="August 16, 2010 10:06PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the owe list would be very good for this, because some of the best comics are those where a character that isn't the toughest guy on the block comes back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287005/#Comment_287005" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T14:56:56+00:00" title="August 17, 2010  2:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey look, a <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=In_a_Wicked_Age" rel="nofollow">thing</a>!<br/><br/>Many of these are incomplete, apparently some are crappy, but there's loads of examples of what other people have done for Oracles. If you want to view the oracles as lists, you have to sign up for the page (to prevent ze spambots). I think "In a Silver Age" is up there. I know I've heard that ideas tossed around, at least. <br/><br/>But yeah, ditto to Joey's comment, that you pretty much just need the new oracle, since the Oracle and examples are really the only setting specific stuff in the rulebook. Powers? Particular strengths! Schticks/particular areas your hero is interested in fighting? Best Interests!<br/><br/>Now, coming up with good oracles is harder than it looks, but at least that's the only real part you'd have to worry about for this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287010/#Comment_287010" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T15:27:18+00:00" title="August 17, 2010  3:27PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2010 3:41PM by DannyK.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this is a great idea for repeat play, because as different oracle elements come up multiple times, it would dynamically emulate the way comic book characters have totally incoherent histories.  The Black Bomber starts off as a villain, then gets rehabilitated and joins the Justice League, then sacrifices himself to defeat the threat of Xantos the Elder God.  But wait!  Two years later, three writers later, the Black Bomber gets resurrected by aliens and comes back as a cosmic vigilante.  And five issues later, it turns out "he" was a woman all along!  <br/><br/>I love that stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noahtrammell" title="noahtrammell"><img alt="noahtrammell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noahtrammell">noahtrammell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288243/#Comment_288243" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-23T07:23:12+00:00" title="August 23, 2010  7:23AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could write the oracles like the splashes on the front pages of the comics.
