I knew there was a game in there I wanted to play... the setting was amazing, the color incredibly evocative.... but the resolution mechanics always let me down.<br/><br/>And after rummaging through all the new-fangled systems we have these days to make the play of <i>Traveller</i> more in line with what I always wanted, I settled on <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>.  The port was strangely easy; the system and the tools of the rules lined up to my needs almost 1:1 to what I wanted.  There are no Demons in this game -- it's straight up Third Imperium Classic <i>Traveller</i>.  But there are things like Psionics, Ambition, Social Standing, The Ticket which replace Lore and that can gum up a character's Humanity.  Humanity in this game is defined as Friendship.<br/><br/>Here's the link to <a href="http://playsorcerer.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/ss.pdf" rel="nofollow">the rules.</a>  I'm sure there's a lot of cleaning up to do.  Inside, you'll find:\n<ul>\n<li>A few pages of world background.  We're using the Classic <i>Traveller</i> Third Imperium, utilizing the FRAMEWORK of the setting (the Imperium, the Spinward Marches, the Zhodani, the Vargr, the Alsan, the noble house structure and politics, the Planet Creation Rules and subsector maps, and all the implied details from Books 1, 2, and 3 from the Traveller Black Box).  However, we're <i>stripping out </i>all the specifics of the worlds, creating our own worlds and subsectors within the Spinward Marches.<br/></li><li>Character Creation Rules (which strangely didn't have to be altered that much!  The Descriptors for Stamina and Will are lifted straight from <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>)  The biggest change is switching Lore to "The Rift" which are the things that can separate people from their friends.<br/></li><li>A section on what I wanted to play in <i>Traveller</i>, and how I ended up choosing <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>.<br/></li><li>Pages of material from the Mongoose's Traveller System Reference Document (open source) since most of the Players had little interaction with Classic Traveller and I wanted them to see equipment lists and World Creation stuff</li>\n</ul>\nAnd here's a link to <a href="http://playsorcerer.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/sspcsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">the character sheet.</a><br/><br/><br/>My Players (Eric, Vasco and Colin) started Character Creation on Sunday night, and <i>damn</i> if we didn't start getting some great PCs with great Kickers, Prices and history.

He might be in his 30s, 40s, or 50s after a distinguished or undistinguished military career.  Now that he has left the service, what will he do with his days?  What will he see as a worthy activity?  Given that your character is versed in combat, experienced in war, trained for battle \u2013 what will he choose to do now that his life is his own?<br/><br/><i>Your character has a wandering bug</i><br/>By definition, your character is not ready to settle down.  Whatever compelled him to begin a life of motion, violence and risk is still in his system.  This might be a temperamental issue or an issue of circumstance.  Your character might have ambitions not yet met, debts to pay with blood, opportunities to seize, a problem with the law, a true love that can only be won with astonishing deeds, and so on...   All of this is tied to your character\u2019s PRICE; something marked your character as a victim of wanderlust \u2013 what is it?<br/>You decide your character\u2019s relationship to the Imperium and society as a whole<br/><br/>Your character might be loyal to the Imperium \u2013 or bitter and resentful for a host of reasons.  You might be loyal to a local planet, or hunted by the husband of a woman you dishonored.  You might be an up-and-comer out to prove yourself worthy of ruling a subsector, or the daughter in too large a royal family who has set out to carver her own role and identity. <br/><br/><i>Your characters are bound together through military service</i><br/>Whatever ambitions or threats or unresolved business your character is focused on, you know you have each other\u2019s backs in a way no one else in the Imperium ever will. You know each other as brothers-and-sisters-in-arms, having fought, survived and protected each other.  The definition of HUMANITY for this game is FRIENDSHIP.  The friendship between the Player Characters is what the game is about. <br/> <br/><i>PCs are Solomani, Vargr or Aslan</i><br/>Moreover, the game is set within the social and political framework of the Imperium.  Each PC, in one way or another, is a citizen of the Imperium.  If your character is Solomani, he or she was born as a citizen.  If Vargr or Aslan, he or she was either born as a citizen, or migrated to the Imperium and for whatever reason now lives within the Imperium\u2019s political and social structure.  Another option is that your Character is not a citizen of the Imperium, but lives within and relation to the Imperium, and strives to become a citizen of the Imperium.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172137/#Comment_172137" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T12:21:14+00:00" title="September 30, 2008 12:21PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2008 12:43PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>SCORES</b><br/>When creating a character, divide 10 points between STAMINA, WILL and THE RIFT.  The fourth Score, PAST, is equal to either Stamina or Will, as determined by the Player<br/>.  <br/>STAMINA<br/>Stamina is both a physical and mental phenomenon. It is not \u201cbody.\u201d  Stamina is the impact on, and the influence over, physical motion and effect.  When your character calls upon memories of childhood abuse to draw up hate in order to heft a tire iron through a bad guy\u2019s face \u2013 that\u2019s Stamina.  By contrast, if a character looms large physically to intimidate someone, that Will.  Stamina draws on whatever physical and mental reserves are necessary for its effect.<br/><br/>WILL<br/>Will is both a physical and mental phenomenon. It is not \u201cmind.\u201d  Will is the impact on, and the influence over, personalities. When your character looms large physically to intimidate someone, that is Will.  By contrast, when your character calls upon memories of childhood abuse to draw up hate in order to heft a tire iron through a bad guy\u2019s face \u2013 that\u2019s Stamina.    Will draws on whatever physical and mental reserves are necessary for its effect.<br/><br/>THE RIFT<br/>In the Third Imperium, \u201cthe rift\u201d is slang for the gap that opens between people because of distances involved in space travel.  Children who leave home and travel countless parsecs away leave a hole in their parent\u2019s heart.  Parents who take jobs that keep them away for months or weeks at a time become strangers to their families.  Interstellar governments are fragile because it\u2019s difficult to keep interests shared when people are so far apart.<br/><br/>The phrase has a second meaning, as well.  For those who travel the stars, the friends you travel with are your anchors to remaining connected to your humanity.  \u201cA man without friends is a man drifting in space,\u201d the saying goes.  When people begin to lose this connection to others, it is said, \u201cHe\u2019s got a Rift going.\u201d  <br/><br/>The Rift on a character\u2019s sheet is the threat to the Character\u2019s Humanity.  It allows the Player Character to get things done in a variety of ways, but by taking action within The Rift the Player must make a Humanity check roll for the Character.  To use The Rift \u2013 either as a Roll to get Bonus dice for a more important roll, or to tap unexpected resources within the fiction \u2013 the Character must do something in the fiction to gain more dice.  Like Lore in Sorcerer, the in-fiction description of using The Rift produces Bonus Dice and builds a greater chance of success.  But these descriptions all must threaten the Characters Humanity \u2013 which in this game is Friendship.<br/><br/>The Rift is a broad category of options containing several Descriptors to choose from.  Players choose which Descriptor they want.  A value of 4 or more allows Players to choose two Descriptors if they wish.<br/><br/>It is important that the Player add details to the Big Circle on the character sheet for The Rift quadrant.  In the same way the Player should add details for Kicker, Price, and Past, so the Player should create NPCs and Locations that are part of the Player Character\u2019s Rift.<br/><br/>PAST<br/>Past represents the most significant piece of your Character\u2019s history in terms of experience, training, friendships and life in general.  Players can tap this Score to accomplish things (\u201cI\u2019m rolling my Gunnery Sergeant to take that truck down!\u201d) to tapping contacts (\u201cThere\u2019s got a be a mercenary company somewhere around here,\u201d) to gathering resources (\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know where we can get some guns off the radar.\u201d)<br/><br/>Past Scores can be used to creates rolls for Bonus dice that roll into a roll on the other three Scores, just as the other three Scores can be used to roll in Bonus dice for a Past roll.<br/><br/>The Past Score is equal to the Character\u2019s Will or Stamina, at the Player\u2019s choice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172139/#Comment_172139" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T12:21:49+00:00" title="September 30, 2008 12:21PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>DESCRIPTORS</b><br/>After you have assigned points choose descriptors from the lists below.  Any Scores with a value of 4 or higher may choose two descriptors. <br/><br/>STAMINA DESCRIPTORS<br/>Natural Fighter:  You\u2019re all about mixing it up; it\u2019s always been that way for you.  It\u2019s your fun. Whether it\u2019s your buddies or some guy you want to kill, it\u2019s always a good time.<br/>Trained Soldier:  You get your physical prowess from your training and combat experience<br/>Big and Vigorous:  Speaks for itself.<br/>Just healthy:  (recommended Stamina = 2 or 3) This is for characters who are not physically special in any way.<br/>Clever in Combat: You\u2019re a thinker, and you\u2019ve learned the tactics and the strategies of how to take someone down. <br/><br/>WILL DESCRIPTORS<br/>Brush with the Unknown:  In the course of an otherwise normal life, the character has encountered something strange: Psionics, the Ancients, a religion of mystical power.  Ever since, nothing has been really satisfying.  You must define the experience and the character\u2019s reaction to it ever since.<br/>Aristocrat:  This is not a social status as much as a state of mind.  The character is \u201cthe cat who walks by himself,\u201d and all places are alike to him.<br/>Zest for life:  Wahoo!  If it\u2019s fun or feels good, you go for it.  If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s in your way.<br/>Angry:  The character is pissed off and thoroughly ready to express this state of mind to all and sundry.<br/>Vow:  The classic motivator.  Vengeance, regaining property or status, whatever \u2013 you want it and you\u2019re going to get it.<br/>Leader of men: Basic charisma; people trust you and respect the character.  It is usually combined with focused or unfocused ambition; the character dislikes being anywhere except in a position of leadership.<br/>Lover:  The character derives great inner strength from the love or another, whether a specific person or anyone who he\u2019s interested in today.<br/><br/>\u201cTHE RIFT\u201d DESCRIPTORS<br/>Ambition: Your drive to get ahead or get something done serves you well, but on occasion makes you cold, putting those you care about at risk, or even makes you realize you don\u2019t care as much about them as you thought.<br/><br/>Duty:  You have obligations \u2013 to the law, to a code, to a family \u2013 that allow you to tap resources, but also allow you to change loyalties when friendship vs. duty is on the line \u2013 because your sense of duty trumps all.<br/>Psionics:  Psionics is the study of powerful psychic disciplines.  It requires incredible concentration as well as solitude.  It allows you to manipulate objects or the minds of others.  It is an invasive discipline.  It also is the secret to tapping the artifacts and mysteries of the Ancients; but to do so is to begin to see Humanity from their cold perspective.<br/>Social Standing:  Whether your trying to attain, avoid it, are stuck in a criminal past, or hate folks with a snooty attitude, this Rift means that you are incredibly class conscious (no matter where you stand on the Social Standing ladder).  You can tap resources of one kind or another, but also turn a cold shoulder when your agenda in the part of your life is at stake.<br/>The Ticket:  The cold calculation of killing for cash or seeing life only as a matter of violence is taking a toll on your soul.  You can\u2019t afford to get to close to people, because they might be gone tomorrow \u2013 or because they\u2019re only fodder to set up the next paycheck.  What matters is the job \u2013 and the next job, and the one after that.  You know how to calculate the odds for the best chance of profit and survival \u2013 and that sometimes means burning folks who never saw it coming. <br/><br/>PAST DESCRIPTORS<br/>This descriptor is very flexible.  For this game the only limitation is a variation on Army, Marines, or Navy.  But Players are free to create viable variations, such as Navy Officer or Marine Gunner. This Score informs not only skills, but contacts, resources and anything else that falls under the umbrella of \u201cMy guy would know that.\u201d<br/><br/> <br/>PRICE<br/>This is the thing that marks you in some way, giving you a -1 Die penalty in certain circumstances (\u201cWhen in Space,\u201d or \u201cFighting Unarmed Man\u201d) that occurred at some time in your character\u2019s history.  It might have happened in the service, or be some incident from your characters childhood.  No matter what, it is tied to the reason your character is a Traveller.<br/><br/>KICKER<br/>Kickers are the things that start off the story for the Player Character. They are the situation that the Player "authors" for his PC. <br/>Kickers are 1) emotionally grabby in some way to the Player; 2) demand a decision or action on the part of the PC (they can't be ignored); and 3) what that decision is remain open-ended until play ensues (which way the PC responds to the Kicker is unknown until the actual circumstances of the GM framing the scene and the Player interacting with the circumstances in play.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172141/#Comment_172141" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T12:25:49+00:00" title="September 30, 2008 12:25PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2008 6:16PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a section of the Campaign Setting Notes, important I think because it gets to the heart of what I'm going after:<br/><br/><b>THE TIES THAT BIND</b><br/>One aspect of the transfer did stump me, though: What would be the definition of Humanity?<br/><br/>Humanity is the most important mechanic in a game of Sorcerer, and holds the same position in Sorcerer &amp; Sword.  It is the thematic focus of the game, allowing the Players to take their characters in all sorts of directions story-wise, but serves as a \u201csun\u201d for all those actions to orbit.<br/><br/>I wasn\u2019t sure how to proceed, and started a thread at The Forge about the matter.  I outlined everything I\u2019ve written above (about The Man Who Would Be King, PCs as brothers in arms and so on) and asked for help finding a good definition of Humanity for the game.<br/><br/>Ron Edwards replied:<br/><br/><i>Anyway, regarding Humanity, it jumps right out at me from your sources: FRIENDSHIP. I agree that age, ambition, and limits of the past (successes as well as failure) upon the present are a big deal, but I think of those as the framework for the really trenchant outcomes for all those stories - which are about friends.</i><br/><br/>He then went on to ask a series of questions:<br/><i>\u2022\tIs it friendship to sacrifice yourself for the friend? What if you do so to manipulate him?<br/>\u2022\tIs it friendship to go ahead and save yourself when your friend stands in the breach so you can do it?<br/>\u2022\tIs it friendship to back up your friend when he's being stupid? Is it friendship to kick him in the ass, or in some cases, to kick his ass really bad?<br/>\u2022\tHow does shared experience and long history with shared duty, or with past success or failure, define friendship?<br/>When I think of all your references, that's what sings out at me.</i><br/><br/>This was exactly what I had been looking for.  Strangely, a discussion about the Humanity definition for Sorcerer &amp; Sword was taking place at the same time, and the same answer had been given there.  Once again, the Traveller I wanted to play had lined up neatly with Sorcerer &amp; Sword.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that the Humanity mechanic for Sorcerer is not a dry, intellectual exercise.  It is not an academic matter.  Just like in any story that catches our attention, the thematic material only matters if it actually matters to the Players at the table.  So Ron finished his response with the following.<br/><br/><i>And not for internet answering, Christopher, but do you trust friendship? Does its dangers really outweigh its benefits, when we're not talking about George Lucas or Disney (in which friendship, success, duty, and reward always support one another)? And even if the danger does come home to roost sometimes, is friendship still worth it?<br/>I don't know if these questions make you shudder a little when you consider them for real. If so, then I'm on the right track.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172142/#Comment_172142" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T12:26:16+00:00" title="September 30, 2008 12:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In fact, the questions did make me shudder.  These are questions that I, as a person, care about.  And I shudder because I\u2019m not sure what the answers are, but I wish I did.  They are issues of real life \u2013 and specifically have a bearing on my life.<br/><br/>The last elements fell into place.  The game would be about characters who had served together.  Who had forged friendships in battle, and now, having left the service, were still friends.  Each would be a wanderer in one way or another: someone who did not know how to settle down.  But still, by definition of the game, had a need for friends and friendship. As they adventured, both working together and pursuing their own goals, their commitment to each other and to the concept of Friendship would be tested.  <br/><br/>Thus, I had a group of PCs bound not by the concept of \u201cThe Party\u201d nor rules mechanics that promised bennies if they stuck together.  But a mechanic that said, \u201cIn the sprawl of space, friendship is what makes you human.\u201d  The stress on friendship, the pulling away and pulling back together allows an elasticity of behaviors.  I don\u2019t need them stuck together like a multi-legged beast, because I know that human beings \u2013 being pattern making creatures \u2013 will strive to orbit this definition of Humanity.  It might be an elliptical orbit: sometimes they will orbit close, and other times their orbit will take them at a far distance... but it will always be centered on this concept.<br/><br/>This definition will not only apply to the Player Characters in regard to each other, but to other NPCs.  How they treat people they meet, who they let into their circle, who they deny, who they remain loyal to or betray will serve as the backbone of their adventures.<br/><br/>When I look back on my dreams of a Traveller game from when I first picked it up, to my revelation of <i>The Man Who Would Be King</i> as a perfect Traveller story, to my discovery of new games over the past ten years, I see that this kind of game, with Friendship as the center point and stress point of the game, is exactly the kind of game I would have wanted.<br/><br/>In the stories of Conan and other memorable characters from the sword &amp; sorcerery pulps \u2013 the springwell of Ron\u2019s Sorcerer &amp; Sword \u2013 the characters are always making new friends, befriending folks in need, and deciding where they\u2019ll draw the line on who they\u2019ll live or die for.  It is my belief that this is a perfect thematic mapping for the universe of Traveller.<br/><br/>After all, are not the first words anyone reads when encountering the game of Traveller a plea for help from a stranger?<br/><br/><i>This is Free Trader Beowulf, <br/>Calling anyone...<br/>Mayday, Mayday... we are under attack...<br/>Main drive is gone...<br/>Turret number one not responding...  <br/>Mayday... loosing cabin pressure fast...<br/>Calling anyone... please help...  <br/>This is Free Trader Beowulf...<br/>\t\t\t\t\tMayday...</i><br/><br/>Who is this person who needs help? What new troubles or friendship will be engendered if I answer that call?  How complicated will my life become?  What happens if I don\u2019t help?  What happens if I do?<br/><br/>It is my hope and expectations that this current combination of rules and setting will deliver on the promise of that S.O.S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rustin" title="Rustin"><img alt="Rustin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rustin">Rustin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172143/#Comment_172143" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T12:31:25+00:00" title="September 30, 2008 12:31PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really cool.<br/>\nFYI: I was reading the definitions of STA and WIL and I'm not sure if there is a duplication or typeo, but it looks like Sta is listed early under WIL.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172145/#Comment_172145" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-30T12:33:08+00:00" title="September 30, 2008 12:33PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2008 12:44PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rust, <br><br/>I think that what you're seeing is me comparing and contrasting Will and Stamina under each heading.

Let me say this first: It's certainly not my intent to have set this up for that purpose.  I did it because I needed a tool to play GDW's Classic Third Imperium <i>Traveller</i> setting, and I realized that this was going to get me what I wanted.  So, in a strange way, I wasn't thinking about anyone else except <i>me</i> and the fun I wanted.  Me, me, me, me, me.<br/><br/>Okay.  I was also thinking of everyone on this board who had also been looking for a way to hippy-up <i>Traveller</i>.  In the context of my group, we had everyone had just finished up a long <i>Sorcerer</i> game, so I guess we'd had our introduction.  So whether or not my players were "ready" for something else I don't know.  I know locally and specifically to me and my four players, I wanted to do this -- so I'm doing it.  Let me think more on it.  <br/><br/>But I can say without doubt that it had nothing to do with getting people to play <i>Sorcerer</i> as a gateway drug of some kind.  I needed a rules set.  I rummaged around.  After rummaging around I realized that the rules for <i>Sorcerer</i> and <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> were going to give me the clearest package of fun for what I wanted.  This was, as I said in the document, a surprise.  <br/><br/>I find it funny that there are people who go around babbling that <i>Sorcerer</i> is "showing its age" or get caught up in some sort of scheme of "technological advancement" suggesting that a game that was published last year is going to be inherently "better" for fun than a game that was published a decade ago.  As far as I can tell, that's about as dunderheaded as assuming a painting of the 20th Century is, by definition, going to be better than a painting from the 17th Century.<br/><br/>Here's my take: I see a lot of games that have one or two really cool core ideas, or a whole bunch of new ideas, that are really smart and really fun to play, but that simply don't deliver <i>the kind of fun I want</i> as consistently to me as <i>Sorcerer</i> does.  <i>Sorcerer</i> has a lot of smaller -- perhaps more delicate, moving parts -- that all interact with each other in fascinating ways that get my group to work together in ways that other games simply don't.  Every time I thought I was going to have to tweak one or two rules to get what I wanted out of the <i>Traveller</i> rule/setting port, I thought there'd be some work I'd have to do.  But in fact, the game is very complete and very thought out and invariably, except in one case -- covering Steve's question -- there was nothing to change or fix.  Now, if there had been no <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> this would not have been the case, because a lot of the attitude and feel of the adventure fiction was really 1:1.  But with <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>, it was just <i>there</i>.<br/><br/>So, no.  There was no attempt at, "How do I get people to play Sorcerer -- oh! -- maybe this will work!"  Picking <i>Sorcerer</i> was simply the easiest tool to use for a problem I needed to solve, as well as being a game that I trust to reliably deliver the fun.  As for <i>Play Sorcerer</i>, I do think seeing the game from a new angel will inform the book -- which I'm very excited about.<br/><br/>[cont'd]                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172539/#Comment_172539" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T04:58:37+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  4:58AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2008 5:09AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [cont'd]<br/><br/><br/>As for being a fix for disinterest in the basic game: One of my players seems to be one of the nicest guy in the world.  To get him to even imagine playing a PC who would summon a demon on purpose was a difficult stretch for our <i>Sorcerer</i> game.  He had a blast playing a <i>Sorcerer</i> game we played.  But man, he twisted and turned like a fish on a hook sometimes, trying to come up with a way where he "accidently" summoned the demon during character creation, walling off his NPCs entirely from the story so he'd essentially be an orphan and so no harm could come to them, and so on...  For him, the bad guys are "out there" -- and I promised myself I would never put him in the position of <i>having</i> to summon a demon into a dysfunctional relationship ever again.<br/><br/>Now, <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> doesn't demand a dysfunctional relationship with a demon.  You might end up with a bound demon -- or not.  You might make a pact with a demon (per the new rules in the book), but that side steps the dysfunctional <i>relationship</i> that <i>Sorcerer</i> requires with demons.  But, truly, you might never deal with demons or Old Ones or whatever except with the end of your sword. If that's how you want to roll, that's cool.  So, again, the fact that Sorcerer &amp; Sword existed is what made my brain go, "Hey, for the rules for an awesomofied <i>Traveller</i> game, <i>Sorcerer</i> and <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> might work really well!"<br/><br/>So, while pulp sword &amp; sorcery source material that Ron Edward's is working from, full of strange gods/old ones/demons, how a protagonist interacts with it is up to the Player.  The source material is not just full of magic, but <i>weirdness</i> -- needs to have rules for this stuff.  And the Sorcerer rules do it brilliantly.  The thing is, if you haven't played <i>Sorcerer</i>, you won't really know what you're giving up by not (or never) making deals or binding relationships with these creatures.  The choice wouldn't be as interesting.  So, I see the value of playing basic <i>Sorcerer</i> first in this context.<br/><br/>For the <i>Traveller</i> rules/setting port, however, this is kind of a not a problem and kind of a problem at the same time.  The psionics from Traveller are a perfect fit if you squint only a little and see the psionics and the Ancients as something really weird and strange.  I don't think it requires that much of a squint at all -- and I think make psionics and the Ancients frankly more interesting.  Much richer in color.  In the GDW (et al) canon material, the Ancients come off as plot mcguffins -- "An ancient city! Go!" -- but not much more.  But, then, the GDW material often eschewed strangeness or disorder.  But lets face a fact: the Ancients took genetic stock of earth and scattered it across the stars for their own, unknown purposes.  They are kissing cousins to Lovecraft's creations -- and Lovecraft's creations directly influenced Howard's Conan books and setting.<br/><br/>So, if you're going to do a Traveller port and you want psionics to really, really enter into play in a strong way, then having the experience with the <i>Sorcerer</i> rules would be of big help.  And certainly I was tempted to shift the setting to that.  But then I realized that while I <i>want</i> the option to make that part of the game, I really didn't want the weird Ancients/psionics stuff to be a focus.  So, the need for the contrast with the basic <i>Sorcerer</i> rules wouldn't be that vital.  In my view.<br/><br/>I believe then, to directly answer your question, that an experienced GM and new players would work fine.<br/><br/>The one thing I'm discovering is that I have internalized a LOT of the Third Imperium material over the years, but my players are all new to it.  So I know exactly the context I want the game to work within.  But, yes, I think it would work really well, actually.  <br/><br/>That all said, this second-half of the post is now touching on Steve's question.  But it's the middle of the night (I woke up for some reason) and must now get back to bed!<br/><br/>Steve, I'll get back to you tomorrow.  Sorry about the delay.

I'm still waiting on the finalized character sheets, but here's a summary of what happened.  While reading all this, remember that the definition for Humanity is Friendship in this game.  It echoes across all the decisions the Players made.<br/><br/>There was a great deal of brainstorming and sometimes the backstories started getting very convoluted and complicated.  At one point there was an emphasis on Spec Ops for one of the PCs, and I could feel the whole game shifting to some bizarro space-hack Bourne Identity game -- which had nothing to do with what I wanted to play.  So I made a call: The PCs were either Marines, Navy or Army.  That's it.  Things went much faster after that.<br/><br/>The Players decided that they had served in the Imperial Marines together.  They also decided that after mustering out, the three of them started a mercenary company... a small one of about 20 guys and a starship crew working off a tramp freighter.  The handle both small unit jobs, as well as getting subcontracted for larger mercenary tickets.<br/><br/>Colin decided that his PC had been on a world working alongside rebels that the Imperium had encouraged to violence.  Just when the final assault had been called, the ruling power sued for peace with the Imperium and negotiations finalized.  When the Imperium got what it wanted, the war was called off and Colin's battalion ordered off planet.  This left the rebels without the backup they needed and the ruling government slaughtered untold rebels.  (Colin explicitly based this on the actions of the Bush Sr.'s call to the Kurds to rise up again Saddam after the First Gulf War.  Eric and Vasco decide their characters had been on the world as well.)  Colin said this would be the basis for his character's Price.  <br/><br/>His Kicker was that his merc company had just hired onto a ticket to fight for the ruling government against the rebels he had betrayed years before.<br/><br/><br/>Vasco decided his character's price was tied to something criminal in his past that had caused him to be BRANDED and kept him moving around from world to world. I pointed out that space was big and that if people on world to world knew what the brand meant it would have to be some sort of capital crime under Imperial law, and suggested his Imperial Citizenship had been revoked -- which would be as big a deal a citizen of the Roman Empire losing his citizenship.  Vasco liked this idea, and built on it: he had been branded in his teens, and had enlisted in the marines to find a place to belong.  He was essentially set up as canon fodder -- but proved himself with marital skill and loyalty time and time again until he DID find a place he could call home.  When he mustered out, he stayed with the two guys he'd bonded with.  This was his home.  <br/><br/>His Kicker is that if he takes the ticket that Colin established as HIS Kicker, his guy gets his citizenship back.  Vasco said, as we discussed the idea, "You know, at first I didn't think the citizenship thing would mean that much to my guy, but actually, I think it means more than... yeah... I really like that."<br/><br/><br/>Eric created a son of a noble family of Imperial politics.  His father is the Duke of a subsector within the Spinward Marches, but Eric's character is rebellious and has lots of trouble with authority.  However, he's a very good and responsible leader to his men.  Although he could have advanced quickly through the ranks because of his noble lineage and his ability, he constantly screwed up his behavior <i>on purpose</i> and remained a sergeant... which is exactly where he wanted to remain.   He was on a world where the marines where fighting a last stand battle during an in interstellar conflict, and losing badly.  An admiral called a retreat to redistribute the forces to world that had a better chance of surviving, but Eric's character destroyed the communication equipment and rallied the troops and locals to a bloody defense.  He said, "Like a whole Alamo thing," which became a shorthand for the incident for all of us.  (The three of them decided to call their company's ship "<i>The Alamo</i>."  Colin added, "In this setting, in the future, The Alamo is shorthand for, 'Fucked over by the officers.'")<br/><br/>Eric's Kicker is that the company is late on payment for <i>The Alamo</i>. If sufficient funds are not wired soon, the loan will default and be absorbed by Fujita Enterprises, where Zee's father A'lan will promptly liquidate the ship and dissolve Zee's company in order to "bring his son home from the war."  So the Ticket on the planet established by Colin's Price and Kicker is vital as an opportunity to make some cash.<br/><br/><br/>A few other details surfaced -- which didn't apply right away, but that I knew I would use because the Players were interested in these things:<br/><br/>Colin said, "I want some sort of religious crusade.  Somehow."  The other guys nodded.  I made a note.<br/><br/>Eric, free-associating off of some of the ideas we'd had, discussed some reading he'd been doing about Israeli/Palestinian dynamics, telling a specific incident about how Israelis upstream of a Palestinian settlement cut off the water to the Palestinians -- and how terrible it would be not to have the power to do anything about that.  Okay... imbalance of power between political entities... noted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173699/#Comment_173699" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T23:48:40+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 11:48PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We rolled up one world, the Ticket Planet, using the Classic <i>Traveller</i> World Creation chapter.  We ended up with a desert world with tainted atmosphere, with a balkanized government, several hundred thousand people, and a Class D (poor quality) starport.  We decided that the planet had been in better shape the last time they'd been here; that nukes had been used while they'd been gone that had reduced the population, tainted the atmosphere and several damaged the planet's infrastructure.  We imagined that the reason the Imperium had used the rebels years earlier to gain leverage on the ruling government was to gain access to fuel's used for interplanetary Jump Drives.  The planet was rich with the stuff.<br/><br/>We posited further that the oceans had been burned off during the nuclear war and that the old mining facilities in the sea canyon walls were now the safest place to be.  The ruling government had shelter and technology on their side.  But the outcast/slave cast living in the wilderness died off at early ages and were dwindling in numbers.  However, missionaries from a nearby world (the Crusade!) had arrived with arms and supplies and were helping them wage a last battle against the Imperials allies.<br/><br/>This is the world of the Player's Kickers.  This is where they'll be heading for the game.<br/><br/>The whole process of creating the worlds in <i>Traveller</i> is a blast.  You roll random details about tech level, planet size, government and law type and so on... and you then use that as "a prod to the imagination" as the Classic <i>Traveller</i> rules say.  As we built up details it seemed like a mix of the imaginative prod of <i>In a Wicked Age...</i>'s Oracles and the setting creation system from <i>Shock:</i> as we took a combination of interesting, randomized and suggested elements and built a setting of conflict out of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173700/#Comment_173700" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T23:58:13+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 11:58PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 12:01AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of days later I started working on some background notes for setting and situation, based off the Players' Characters.<br/><br/>I decided to create some subsectors, again, using the standard rules from <i>Traveller</i>.  A subsector in Traveller is a unit of political space -- an area about 8 by 10 parsecs in size.  If it's part of the Imperium there would be a duke ruling over it on behalf of the Imperium.  Sixteen subsectors make up a sector.  For sectors make up a domain.  There are about nine domains in the Third Imperium.<br/><br/>(Communication in the Third Imperium can only go as fast as space travel. As space travel takes weeks and months between stars, the Imperium holds itself together by family ties and loyalty -- families and noble rules must act on their own and in the best interests of the Imperium using only their own judgment and authority in moments of crisis.  Sometimes, of course, the system fails.  But for the most part, it has held the Third Imperium together for 1000 years.)<br/><br/>A subsector map is made up of an eight by ten hexgrid map.  You roll a dice to see if there is a world in a hex (I set it at a 40% chance) and then roll up the world details.  I rolled for the stars, but have only made notes for about four worlds in addition to Vaerr, which is the Ticket World tied to the PC's Kickers.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://playsorcerer.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/brillsubsectormap.pdf"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173706/#Comment_173706" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T00:21:59+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:21AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 11:38PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a <a href="http://playsorcerer.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/brillsubsectorinformation.pdf" rel="nofollow">five page document</a> about the Brill Subsector.  <br/><br/>I decided the rebels on Vaerr had been Vargr, a race of creatures created out of Canine stock from Sol thousands and thousand of years ago.  They stand about five feet tall and can use equipment and weapons designed for humans.  They have their own cultural quirks, and I'm seeing them as loyal to whoever treats them best lately.<br/><br/>The Vargr had settled the Brill Subsector long before members of the Humanti race arrived.  When settlers from Sol did arrive, the Vargr aided the settlers and kept them alive during the Long Night -- the fallow period that took place between the Second and Third Imperiusm.  Together they built the Utheng Federation -- which once contained the worlds listed on the map, as well as the worlds in the Llako Protectorate and the worlds of Helius and Arzul.<br/><br/>When the Third Imperium showed up some eight hundred years later, the human settlers refused to become part of the Imperium.  The Vargr got caught up in the middle, used by either side to hurt the other.  <br/><br/>Inbetween the Fourth and Fifth Frontier Wars, the Imperium rallied a Vargr Rebellion on Vaerr and nearby worlds -- which culminated in the incident that Colin described as his Character's Price.  The worlds around Llako surrendered to the Imperium, broke away from the Utheng Federation, and became a Client State of the Third Imperium.  Trade ties between the Llako Protectorate are growing stronger, and nobles around the subsector believe they can conquer the Utheng Federation and draw the Brill Subsector into the Third Imperium in the next 50 years.<br/><br/>The "Alamo" world Eric created is Helius, which also used to be part of the Utheng Federation.  I decided that the battle took place during the Fifth Frontier War, and once again the PCs and their fellow marines were fighting alongside Vargr -- Vargr who had broken away from the Humaniti and Vargr of the Utheng Federation and wanted a safe haven for Vargr in the subsector.  The Imperium had promised them Helius if they helped fight of the Utheng Federation and the Zhodani Consulate who had joined forces to attack the Imperium border worlds.  When the battle on Helius went south, the order came to retreat... but this time the PCs refused to abandon the Vargr and fought like hell to protect it.  The losses due to the actions of Eric's character were horrific (Eric added that detail) but the marines defended the planet and the Vargr have a safe world now.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, trouble is brewing back on Vaerr... religious missionaries and troops have arrived from the Z'hande Caliphate sprinkling food and medicine to the Vargr across the Llako Protectorate.  Loyalties between humans and Vargr are split all over the place, and members of the Z'hande Caliphate are gathering converts and allies as they prepare to make their own play for control of the subsector.<br/><br/>The PCs are returning to the world where they once betrayed allies, allies who now get weapons and instructions from a religiously inspired civilization that threatens the Imperium,<br/><br/>Which way they'll jump as old and new allies appear and friendships are broken, tested and formed is what the game is all about...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173708/#Comment_173708" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T00:36:06+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 12:36AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve,<br/><br/>I'm still working on "The Rift" rules.  <br/><br/>The short hand of "Why not psionics?": <br/><br/>The mechanic of Lore is there to threaten Humanity.

I mean, I was never that crazy about <i>Star Wars</i>. Ever.  One person's color is another person's "WTF?"<br/><br/>I'm using the GDW <i>Traveller</i> setting as my background.  In that setting The Ancients, a race of beings that settled the stars about 240,000 years ago, had technology whose level was apparently unmatched by the Imperium, and seeded sentient beings including Humaniti across various worlds of the galaxy. The took samples from Sol -- including humans and animals -- and manipulated the biology, settling them across the stars.  The purpose is unknown.  The Vargr race is one of those experiments.<br/><br/>Heres' the run down from some Traveller stuff:  <i>Intelligent Major Race derived from Ancient genetic manipulations of Terran carnivore/chaser stock, apparently dating from approximately the same time that Humaniti was scattered to the stars.<br/><br/>Inhabiting a region rimward of the Imperium, the Vargr were for years a puzzle to Imperial xenologists. The Vargr biochemistry and genetic makeup are almost identical with a number of terrestrial animals, but differ radically from most of the flora and fauna indigenous to Lair, the purported Vargr home world. Researches during the early years of the Third Imperium concluded them to be the result of genetic manipulation of transplanted Terran animals of the family Canidae, almost certainly of genus Canis. The obvious conclusion, supported by archeological evidence, is that the race known as the Ancients was responsible.</i><br/><br/>I think The Ancients are a cool part of the GDW <i>Traveller</i> universe.  They've left behind all sorts of ruins, weird science stuff, and strange mysteries tying together lots of interstellar history.  I think the trick isn't to see the Vargr as "Dog people" -- though someone could and certainly use them that way.  They are a concrete product of a highly advance and mysteriously vanished civilization.  This kind of "science as unexpectedly weird" is, I think, an important part of Traveller.  In my view, looking only at Books 1, 2 and 3, the setting and the game is very grounded in mundane details, feel and tone.  It isn't <i>Star Wars</i> at all.  And yet... there are hints at extraordinary aspects to life among the stars.... the mysteries we will never understand, the technologies that exist or existed that will never be ours to use.  There is this tension between the very mundane feel of so much of life in the Traveller setting butting up against the extraordinary.  In a way, it reminds me of what Greg Stafford built with Pendragon, with rules that created a tension between the very muddy and mundane on one side, and the fantastical and idealistic on the other.<br/><br/>Of course, tone, presentation and application matter.<br/><br/>Here's a passage from an email I sent to my Players:<br/><br/><b>When he was shooting <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> and <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> back to back, Christopher Lee commented that on Lucas' film, everything was shot on an utterly clean soundstage, while on Jackson's film the actors ended up with dirt under their fingernails.<br/><br/>You know how Jackson's film felt like it has a weight and concreteness to it, no matter how fantastical?<br/><br/>That.</b><br/><br/>So, even though we've got Dog People, they're not Dog People.  They're Vargr.  And they should have weight and substance and emotions worthy of Jackson's WETA team down in New Zealand.  They are race of creatures being overrun by Imperial expansion and choosing alliances or making last stands or pushing back as best they can to survive.<br/><br/>If we use them as just background or color we've screwed up.  We see them as goofy or whatnot, we've screwed up.  If we see that as improbable and strange and maybe even impossible -- but treat them as any extraordinary collection of people that have their own hopes and desires -- but are still OTHER -- then we've won.<br/><br/>That's my take, anyway.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173827/#Comment_173827" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T10:24:04+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 10:24AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Hi Judd,<br/><br/>Not sure what to say about that.

You create worlds, generate characters and create a whatever kind of tone and feel you want.<br/><br/>The second game is the the first game with this MONSTROUSLY HUGE background and setting with years and years of details coming from a billion different sources.<br/><br/>I re-read the rules last night (Books 1, 2, and 3) for the first time in years.  It was interesting.  I really had pretty much internalized and memorized the whole game years ago.  But I focused on specific parts of the game and those points of focus became what the game was supposed to be -- to <i>me</i>. Other people saw a differently <i>Traveller</i> entirely.  <br/><br/>As an example, all the stuff about calculating travel times of planet to planet travel, involving several formulas of mass and g force and stuff... that was just color to me.  "Okay, this is a game where the SF is hard.  It should feel grounded and real. The politics and situations should feel like large scale situations you could find around the world and through history.  Not fantasy.  No<i>t Star Wars</i>."  But did I have a single iota of a desire to actually <i>do</i> those calculations?  Not on your life.  It was just a flare that said, "Imagine this stuff mattered in this game -- and extrapolate accordingly."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173979/#Comment_173979" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T18:26:29+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  6:26PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say I had the same reaction as Judd, but I'd put it differently.

I said to myself, "Well, this is the best picture of a Vargr I could find, though I'm not crazy about it."  But I'd once said, "You're not allowed to say, 'It's the best picture I could find!' when the art in your game book confused people.'"  Because the art and stuff is a tool of communication to say, "This game is <i>this</i>."<br/><br/>Now, here's something that is really interesting.  In the Little Black Books of Traveller -- no art, or so so sparse as to have no art.  Not even pictures of ships in <i>Book 5 High Guard</i>, which was all about rules for an interstellar navy.  I find that fascinating.  So many games communicate their tone and feel through the art.  But Traveller, back to the post I made above, was two games -- and one of those games was the utterly "create the SF game you want" game.  Any art in the books would have begun to shatter that approach.  No art in the books it really was up to the players to figure out THEIR traveller game, THEIR SF setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174061/#Comment_174061" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T07:52:38+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  7:52AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to have to find copies of those black books, or at least the reprint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174072/#Comment_174072" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T08:23:01+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  8:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 8:29AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Per,<br/><br/>I just picked up the reprints of Books 0 - 8 from Far Frontier Enterprises.  The book is excellent.  (Though I've only had it two days -- can't speak to it's construction yet!)  <a href="http://www.farfuture.net/" rel="nofollow">farfuture.net</a><br/><br/><br/>One more final strange thing about <i>Traveller</i>.  Though it claimed to be a "make your own thing" game, the text and a lot of the logic of the game rested on assumptions woven into the text: ship travel was slow (no instant travel times nor negligible travel times); communication could only move at the speed of travel (no FTL communication);  a remote centralized government, possessed of great technological and industrial might, but because of travel times and the extent of its empire, unable to exert its control everywhere; a feudal system of honor to help keep peace across the far-flung empire; frontiers with extensive home rule provisions; an emphasis on military skills as being the skills adventurers would need to adventure as PCs in this world (Book 1 options are Army, Marines, Navy, Scouts, Merchant Marine and Other (years of random wandering, maybe underworld activity)), worlds of random disparity in terms of society, technology, law and politics.<br/><br/>Players could ignore the above -- you could use the rules to play <i>Star Trek</i> or <i>Star Wars</i>.  But it meant turning your back on the <i>only</i> scraps of color in the books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174085/#Comment_174085" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T08:49:35+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  8:49AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher:<br/><br/>First - thank you so much for posting this.  I've never really played Traveller, and to be honest didn't know much of the specifics, but your discussion and Sorcerer mod have definitely piqued my interest.<br/><br/>How well do you feel the rules work so far?  You mentioned that you're still working on the Rift rules, but thus far, do they feel solid?  <br/><br/>Regarding the Rift: does the change really require that much work?  From my perspective (just rereading Sorcerer and Sorcerer and Sword), it seems that it's just replacing Lore as the risk to your specific definition of Humanity (Humaniti?) as Friendship.  Shouldn't all the existing rules work as-is?<br/><br/>The only other place I felt lost reading your hack was with regards to weapons and equipment.  A lot of the base elements don't come with any sort of pricing scale, nor do they seem to list damage-type/column.  Considering how much of the document is made up of the equipment lists, these specifics seem important.<br/><br/>I'm asking all of this because a friend of mine who's no longer really into to RPGs used to be a huge Traveller fan back in the day and I'm wondering how well your system would work at cajoling him back into gaming. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Thanks again!<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174090/#Comment_174090" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T09:11:49+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  9:11AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Daniel,<br/><br/>I can't speak to whether you'll succeed with your friend, but here goes.<br/><br/>We're taking the game out for a spin for the first time this Sunday.  The Player have recently emailed me the first pass at their character sheets.  I have to review them, make some suggestions, and get everyone to finalize their PCs.  I'll be posting when they're done.<br/><br/>I think the Rift rules are tricky.  But I'll post more about that after Sunday's game.  I'd love to hear how YOU would use them though.<br/><br/>Weapons: No prices.  Like <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>, equipment is story-specific, not checking account specific.  Starting equipment for a "Kicker Cycle" is determined by the GM with input from Players.  If they decide they really need something else they either a) get it, cause it would make sense they'd get it easy; b) make a Past role or something if some skills were needed; c) end up making a series of rolls upon a series of linked actions if the Past roll failed ("We'll Steal It!")  But that's how this game is going to roll.<br/><br/>Damages, as described in the PDF work on the base type of the weapon.  A rifle is a rifle, whether ballistic or laser.  So you check the "Rifle" row on the <i>Sorcerer</i> damage chart, and there you are.  Same with a ballistic pistol or a laser pistol -- same damage.<br/><br/>What matters is the armor.  (Or, rather, how armor and weapons interact is what matters.)  The logic is this.  People make ballistic guns.  People make armor that protects against ballistic guns.  People make laser weapons that punch through ballistic defenses.  The damage to the <i>person</i> isn't worse -- it's that the armor is or isn't effective against certain attacks -- which protects the person. <br/><br/>This mixing and matching has more implications:  People make armor that diffuses laser attacks.  But armor that works against lasers doesn't work against ballistic attacks. <br/><br/>So, in game terms, the damage from the weapon is reduced by checking the next damage value (not row) above the weapon you were using.  A laser rifle used against reflec (which defends against lasers), slides the damage up to pistol damage.  But if someone is just wearing reflect and gets shot with a ballistic rifle, he takes regular rifle damage.<br/><br/><i>Traveller</i> characters can wear a mix and match combination of certain armors.<br/><br/>I found the manipulation of damage via armor is right there in the Sorcerer rules (much to my surprise!)  My goal is to keep enough variety of the armor types to help build the SF color, without it getting bogged down in lots of cross-referencing weapons/armor/charts and weapon types and stuff.  The <i>Sorcerer</i> rules deliver EXACTLY that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174116/#Comment_174116" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T11:30:28+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:30AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 11:45AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More notes on the <i>Traveller</i> rules:<br/><br/>When I re-read the <i>Traveller</i> rules the other night, I came across this passage on the last page of Book 3.  It's under the last section of the rules called, "A Final Word."<br/><br/><b>"The Players themselves have a burden almost equal to that of the referee: they must move, act, travel <i>in search of their own goals</i>."</b><br/><br/>(Emphasis added.)<br/><br/>I had forgotten about that passage, but I can tell you, that one sentence bore a hole through my head when I first read those books nearly three decades ago because one of my grails of RPG was finding a system and group of players that encouraged -- if not depended on -- Players moving, acting and traveling in search of their <i>own</i> goals.<br/><br/>That's what I wanted, but rarely got it.  The tools weren't in place to help the GM find a focus that didn't depend on some sort of scenario, and the publishers certainly didn't want Character driven play, since that wouldn't make any sense for published modules.  The guy who hires you in the tavern or the patron in <i>Traveller</i> or the Mr. Johnson in <i>Shadowrun</i> and so on were convenient shortcuts to get an adventure going, to be sure... but they darted around the notion that passionate driven Player Characters could be engines to create exciting conflicts and adventures as they drove toward their own goals.<br/><br/>So, I would say <i>Sorcerer's</i> toolkit, which does provide a character creation and play-set that easily handles Characters-as-engines play answers my needs because that's the play I always wanted.  We have lots of games that deliver this in spades these days (<i>In a Wicked Age...</i> delivers it front and center!)  But I think it's important to remember that while player could (and did) shift the assumptions of rules and setting assumptions to have Characters-as-engines play, it was not how most texts assumed play would go, and the rules really didn't support it.<br/><br/>But I'd also say that it was <i>Traveller</i>, which I didn't realize till two days ago, that put that very specific idea in <i>my</i> head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174130/#Comment_174130" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T11:48:59+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 11:48AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>I think the Rift rules are tricky.

The Rift as a lack of empathy towards others; losing your connections, your friendships. The central conceit seems to be the Rift (isolation, solipsism?) versus Humanity/Friendship.   The way I saw it mechanically, was that whenever you take an action that puts your own interests before those of your friends, whenever you choose isolation over connection, you put your Humanity at risk.  Choosing Me over Us.<br/><br/>You could draw on the Rift when isolating yourself from your emotions or your friendships made sense in terms of story, in order to get bonus dice.  Considering your inclusion of the Ancients, I might include using the Rift to use or understand Ancient technology -- at the cost that you start thinking more like an Ancient and less like a Human, which puts me in mind of something like Ted Chiang's "Stories of Your Life."<br/><br/>Gaining Humanity is the inverse: putting friendship and connection and community ahead of everything.  As per the normal rules, the rolls would be The Rift vs. Humanity.<br/><br/>I find the set-up really interesting: it could be used to encompass stories like the "The Man Who Would Be King", or something more intimate, such as Neon Evangelion and its 'Hedgehog's Dilemma'.<br/><br/>Was your intention something more complex than this?  <br/><br/>Thanks for explaining my equipment questions.

Note that the applications are still pretty open ended.  How one gets the Bonus dice can work two ways:<br/><br/>First, you get to make a pre-roll (just like using Cover or Past) to go for Bonus Dice before making the "main" roll -- as long as, as you say, Humanity is at risk. <br/><br/>Second, you can use the equivalent of "Binding" and "Pacts" on people, instead of with Demons.  Again, the to tap "The Rift" Humanity threatening actions must be taken.  (In both cases, those actions will provide color to get Bonus Dice for the roll.)<br/><br/>The thing is, the Sorcerer system is weirdly strong and open-ended.  How to apply the system in this way is one of the thing I want to try out and see how it goes.<br/><br/>So, no.  Not more complicated.  I'd say, "Untested" and "Unknown"!<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: peccable</cite>Thanks for explaining my equipment questions.

Kind of a mistake on my part, in that it wasn't clear.  The Prices mentioned are just for a sense of relative value.  I should probably price everything, or not anything at all.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: peccable</cite>RE: Damage shifting - is this how it works in base Sorcerer?

(page 52 for the Ability).  Kevlar and other modern armor shifts things the same way.  (p. 111)  My shifting to the lesser damage value is my own application of the Armor Ability to my own needs.  It actually makes guns more dangerous in my game, since armor doesn't move all projectile weapons immediately to Fist, only the next lesser damage value.  But it's <i>Traveller</i>.

Binding/Pacts use the "appropriate score" from Stamina, Will or Rift, right?  What would you roll against for the other person?   I'm presuming whatever would seem appropriate.<br/><br/>What does this look like in story-terms?  Is "binding" another human bullying or emotional blackmail?  Is it somehow a perversion of this game's version of Humanity?  A "forced" version of friendship?<br/><br/>So if I'm emotionally bullying someone into a 'binding', we might both roll Will - and like Binding, it would always work, right?  It's just whoever gets the victories can roll them into future rolls connected to the relationship?  And then immediately after this, I have to roll Humanity versus Rift?<br/><br/>Sorry if I'm totally off.  The "Bonus Dice" version of using the Rift was totally clear to me, but I feel like I'm missing something here.<br/><br/>Thanks for the clarifications.  I definitely understand how having armor work this way would make combat *much* more dangerous -- which means you really need to have someone at your side during a fight you can depend on.  Which is exactly the point. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174159/#Comment_174159" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T12:48:25+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 12:48PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's why it's new territory, dude!  No one's ever made a pact with a person before!<br/><br/>But let's say Eric's character, Zee, bullies someone with his Rift (descriptor) Social Standing, using the Rift as a roll in for Will roll against a "lower class" man, getting the man to take Zee and his team in for the night as authorities hunt for them.  He doesn't do this by building a friendship with the guy, right?  He's bullying him...<br/><br/>The value of this as a mechanic is that Bonus Dice only apply to the next "incident" or "moment" that occurs after the next roll.  A binding or a pact <i>carries over time</i>... which means we might have several scenes in the man's house before the authorities show up, but Zee's Pact still stands with the man, meaning Zee's successes influence the effort the man makes to protect Zee and his team.<br/><br/>Another example: The Imperium is held together by a tradition of loyalty via a feudal system.  But someone can be bullied into swearing an oath through fear, or an actual friendship.  One is a form of binding, the other is not -- but the latter is more flexible, honest and probably safer.<br/><br/>But we'll see!  Don't take the Binding and Pact stuff too literally.  I'm just saying there are rules in place to influence and manipulate people in "non-Friend" ways that can extend over scenes and scenes of play based off the idea of binding and pacts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174254/#Comment_174254" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T03:23:57+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  3:23AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is cool stuff.

Today any massive victory is considered an "eighty-six" in military slang, and since that legendary battle there have never been any official 86th company in the Imperium forces, which means a private mercenary organization could get away with that name.</b><br/><br/><br/>After I got the latest email about the ship's art, I added:<br/><br/><b>On Helius, when Zee rallied the tattered remains of the 149th and local Vargr forces, the name 86th got bandied about among the troops -- at first unofficially, and then as a given by the end of the third week of fighting during The Siege of Grozol.  Cut off from communication and support from Imperial forces, the mixed forces in Gorzol began marking their armor with "86th," and using flags and signals referring to the 86th.  Not only did the confuse Zhodani intelligence operations, but it built a unique and unified identity for the mixed troops that helped win the day.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174329/#Comment_174329" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T10:57:45+00:00" title="October  9, 2008 10:57AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am now baffled.<br/><br/>Using the <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> notion of jumping in and out of time Robert E.
