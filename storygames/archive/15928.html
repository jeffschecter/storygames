The 25-words or less pitch is, what if you took all the action heroes from the movies and TV shows of the 1980s and put them all on the same team?  Then had them face off against $OBVIOUS_VILLAIN_ORGANIZATION in the modern era?  I'm picturing things like The A-Team vs. some criminal group, GI Joe vs. Cobra, MI6 vs. SPECTRE, stuff like that.  The heroes all follow from the era; guys inspired by Rambo, MacGyver, and so on.  It's pretty over-the-top.<br/><br/>The player archetypes are already pretty well set, and I'm happy where the game is mechanically.  What I really want to do, though, is figure out how best to plot scenes, and I'd like to mimic the structure (and tropes) of action shows if possible.  So what I'm wondering is, what are some of the standard dramatic structures and plot flows of the genre?<br/><br/>A few pieces I can think of would be a Cold Open (the pre-credits scene in James Bond movies, and most TV shows), investigation, big fights, chase and escape scenes, and so forth, but I want to give the prospective GM guidance on how to put them together.  And for that matter, basic plot types wouldn't hurt, either -- Behind Enemy Lines, Find the Baddie Base, stuff like that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362410/#Comment_362410" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T12:21:42+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 12:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2012 12:22PM by Felan.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you've got time, I highly recommend the book <i>Action Speaks Louder</i> by Eric Lichtenfeld. It's an academic but accessible history of action cinema, mostly focused on Hollywood. It includes some potentially very useful run-downs of the common narrative tropes of various action sub-genres without falling into simplistic or reductive structuralism.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Action-Speaks-Louder-Violence-Spectacle/dp/0275980545" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Action-Speaks-Louder-Violence-Spectacle/dp/0275980545</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimD" title="JimD"><img alt="JimD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimD">JimD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362411/#Comment_362411" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-24T12:32:09+00:00" title="February 24, 2012 12:32PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Felan, that's really boss.
