We've got four players, all new to the game (though three of them are already familiar with Dungeon World). I think everybody had a good time, but I have to admit that a lot more happened than I really expected for that first "follow the players around" session, so I'm wondering whether I'm pacing things poorly and whether I should be doing anything to slow things down at all. In sum:<br/><br/>1. We met from roughly 6:30 to 10:00, and spent over an hour creating characters and kicking around questions/answers about character backgrounds. There was some really excellent stuff in there, but we only got to a tiny portion of it during actual play. Apparently, the Gunlugger recently killed his mentor (just business), but feels bad about his mentor's widow; the Savvyhead relies on one guy for power and a gang of kids for salvage, and has a mentor who disappeared years ago; and the Hocus's Tech Cult has a rival Water Cult. Absolutely none of that came up in play: We just kept making new NPCs and EVERYBODY was barfing forth apocalyptica, including some really great improvisation on their part about what the psychic maelstrom is like. (Apparently, it's hardest to deal with in areas where lots of people died in the apocalypse. They're all set up in Somerville, MA, and don't go into Boston because it's so psychically fucked up that it glows in the dark at night.)<br/><br/>2. The first part of the evening's play dealt with the PCs being holed up in the hardhold while some black rain was going on outside, and they bartered with some bizarre visitors who never spoke or removed their gas masks. This just gave them a chance to see how some of the basic moves worked and improvise a bit on what the holding's barter customs are like (no official currency, more like the jingle you leave behind is all personalized IOUs). Nothing thrilling, just following them around, as I expected the night to go. That didn't last.<br/><br/>3. We took a break and I asked what the players wanted to do next, and the Gunlugger said he wanted a fight. So, when we came back, I said that one of the weird visitors was found dead on their holding's doorstep, and some creative dipping into the maelstrom revealed that the visitor had been killed by another holding a few miles away. When the PCs inspected the body, they found that the mask was basically stuck to whatever was inside, like the person was made of tar, and it blew up all over a couple of them. (Not sure how that will come back up again, but you bet your ass it will.) They decided to use this as excuse to raid the other holding with half a biker gang at their backs. They killed a few guards, literally tore down a wall using chains, and when the rival hardholder and his men hid behind a bunch of innocent mothers and their small children, our Hocus treated the innocents as "a mob" and whipped them into a frenzy to see how gang combat rules work with unarmed kids. We ended there\xa0\u2013\xa0a rival holding basically conquered, a few guards dead, a bunch of children seriously injured, and my PCs not really sure why they felt the need to rescue silent strangers in gas masks, but certainly more familiar with the combat rules than they once were. <br/><br/>4. By the end of the session, two PCs have already reached their first advancement, and the other two are just one experience away from it. (Is that normal? An advancement per 3-4-hour session?)<br/><br/>As I said, this is the first multi-session campaign I've run with this system, so I'm curious whether I've made my job unreasonably hard by introducing so many potential threats. My first-session worksheet has a TON of names on it, including parties that came up during character creation (and never again), cronies of two NPC hardholders, members of the PCs' gang and cult, nameless NPCs the PCs have taken a liking to, and a bunch of people whose names were only learned moments before they died. Is it safest to just leave a bunch of that on the home front and focus on just a few subsets of threats for the actual fronts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388796/#Comment_388796" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T02:11:20+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  2:11AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi<br/><br/>that sounds fine to me. I think somewhere I read that Vincent likes to have 2-3 active fronts in play and maybe another couple in the background ready to come into focus if needed. The key is to focus on what you (+your players) find interesting/cool and let the other stuff fade into the home front or even just be a name, motivation and relationship for now. Obviously occasionally weaving together connections between seemingly unrelated NPCs/events/threats will both ease your prep workload and reinforce the central, related role that the characters/protagonists play in the unfolding story.<br/><br/>My experience is that you can actually generate a campaign's worth of loose ends in the first session, before the characters have even found their feet and decided what direction(s) they are pushing in.<br/><br/>Advancement is _fast_. I have mixed feelings about this as I am more used to traditional games but IMO there are 2 mitigating factors - the characters start out as complete bad-asses anyway and it allows for accelerated play that focuses on story now.<br/><br/>rgds<br/>rob<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388803/#Comment_388803" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T05:44:44+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  5:44AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Rob.

So glad DW can be a gateway to awesome games!<br/><br/>I'd say that pacing sounds fine. I've had pretty similar experiences in a first session, right down to taking over another hardhold. The best thing to do now is to move ahead and let some of those names just kind of fade away as you don't need them. Things will likely come into focus on one area for a while, then move to something else.

The xp are flowing because moves are being made, which is perfect and your GM sheet is full of promise.<br/>Just push a little where the characters are vulnerable, set up triangles and give your NPC's simple motivations that undermine the (non-exisitant) status quo. Its all good!

The various background NPCs and threads that didn't come into play may never come into play, and that's okay.  I typically get an advance per 3 hour session when I play.  You'll start hitting the advanced moves around session 6 at that rate, and that's when you start to see some really interesting choices by the players: given the well-established setting and thge trajectories they've been on, do they want their characters to transform (pick a new playbook), become more completely themselves (advancing basic moves), throw their hands in the air (retire to safety), etc.  <br/><br/>Make sure you work those PC-NPC-PC triangles.  It's not a game of AW until the players twig to the fact that the people they should really worry about are the other PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388817/#Comment_388817" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-30T07:39:49+00:00" title="August 30, 2012  7:39AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that when I play AW or it's hacks, I like running shorter sessions than I traditionally do (like 2-3 hours), but that roughly the same or more narrative content happens in that shorter time period.

I'm just not sure how frequently to advance the countdown for a front, or when to say that a front has been eradicated entirely.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389247/#Comment_389247" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T19:22:42+00:00" title="September  4, 2012  7:22PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For us, the fiction sorta worked the pacing out. I had the fronts 'in the wings' and the players engaged with whatever they were interested in. If they ignored a threat then I would always, always advance that front's countdown and highlight the fictional ramifications by announcing future badness. Even if peripheral, the narrative effect was felt amongst the NPCs and Triangles the PCs were involved with, the holds and environments they traversed. Think want and need, and lack of resource. Its like a permaculture 'edge effect', that's the best way in my hippy mind I could visualise the distinct lack of status quo.\n<blockquote>There is more demand on the edge where two systems [fronts] overlap. Systems [fronts] then demand the resources of both. Use this <b></b><i>edge effect</i> and other [maelstrom] patterns observed to create the best [story] effect.</blockquote>\nAs new NPCs were created on the fly, or characters wandered off and became embroiled in new threats, Fronts emerged (almost obviously) from the story. The fronts resolved as the ficition dictated, sometimes theycompleted their countdown, never engaging with the protagonists, yet leaving their fictional mark on the story to spurn new badness and cesspits full of apocalyptica.<br/><br/>Two fronts sounds fine, though I think Vx suggested somewhere that he had at least a couple of 'proto' fronts, semi-realised in the back of his imagination as he MC'ed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389266/#Comment_389266" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T22:07:13+00:00" title="September  4, 2012 10:07PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks. I actually have more threats and front ideas than I know what to do with right now, so generating more fronts to replace old ones shouldn't be too tough. As for timing, I came up with specific rules governing when the countdowns get activated for certain threats (e.g., mark a tick when you disobey an order from III; mark a tick when you spend a day without treating the black sick). Still trying to figure out when fronts' general countdowns should activate, though. Maybe it'll become more apparent in later sessions. So far I'm largely just reacting to what players are saying, though, and replying "yes" whenever they ask about something that sounds interesting. The savvyhead keeps offering these up wonderfully. ("Can I read a corpse like an object?" Hell yes you can. "I reach into the psychic maelstrom. Did we awaken something evil in the city today?" That sounds awesome, so yes, of course you did. And so on.)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389278/#Comment_389278" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T03:17:44+00:00" title="September  5, 2012  3:17AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds perfect Jason! I think you have to trust in the play and the pacing will flow if you keep doing what you are doing. I mean it really sounds awesome! Your specific countdown triggers are ubiquitous and appropriate, the general countdowns will be most apparent as the fiction dictates. You know what the future badness is going to be if the players do nothing to intervene in the front right? If you don't know, then its a stake and they are full of scene setting goodness! Just push towards scenes that answer those questions as the story needs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389385/#Comment_389385" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-06T06:29:02+00:00" title="September  6, 2012  6:29AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great, thanks.
