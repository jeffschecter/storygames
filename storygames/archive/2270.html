                    I just joined a game that's a port of the TSOY rules to a world of the GM's own design, a post-zombie-apocalypse Oklahoma.  Pretty awesome setting -- little bit Wild West, little bit Road Warrier, little bit Romero.  Tumbleweed and shambling figures on the horizon, that kind of thing.<br/><br/>I'm playing a one-eyed chemist who's also a fair hand with a gun, and I'm trying to figure out just how much the loss of her right eye would affect her ability to aim.  I've never even fired a gun, so I'm honestly not sure how much of a problem the loss of depth perception would be.  I realize I could just ignore this and have her be so badass that she's a crack shot anyway, but I'm the kind of person who at least likes to know the rules before I break them, if you catch my drift. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  So, would having only one eye totally screw someone's ability to fire a six-shooter?  What about a rifle, or something more modern?                </div>

                            Speaking from experience, many shooters (including myself) close one eye anyway when shooting. This is especially true in the case of rifles with sights or scope. Others use both eyes when shooting pistols. So if your shootist still has her dominant eye and learned to shoot with her (now-lost) eye closed, effect should be minimal. Hope that helps.                        </div>

                            Hm, I suppose it <i>might</i> have an effect at longer ranges.  Guessing distance is important in long range shots, because you have to aim high to compensate for the effect of gravity on the bullet.  Knowing the distance lets you accurately determine how much to adjust your hold.  The question, though, is how much range-finding is based on depth perception and how much is based on the relative size of the distant target.  I'm leaning toward the latter, so I'd say minimal effect, if any.                        </div>

                            There are actually several sorts of aiming.<br/>
<br/>
Dave is thinking of when you actually use the sights on a weapon. And he's right, the other eye is a hinderance in this case, so you close it. That said, if the character is right handed, then he'll have to either switch to lefty to be able to use the sights, use a very odd weapon grip (with face over the weapon), or have the sights radically changed on the weapon to account for using the wrong eye. Aiming of this sort counts on the user holding the weapon precisely the same way every time.<br/>
<br/>
Then there's "shooting from the hip" as it were. Rather firing without using the sights. This is something like a whole order of magnitude harder. But potentially made neccessary by circumstances. That is, aiming with sights takes a certain amount of time depending on the weapon and how ready you have it. If both of you have unready weapons, and the distance is short, it may make sense to fire without using the sights to get the shot off first.<br/>
<br/>
That said, a lot of weapons training is about how to automatically use the sights every time. Because even at short range, not aiming with sights can mean a miss.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, for this sort of quick sightless aiming, depth perception is probably somewhat important. But given the overall inaccuracy of the method, it may be less important than the difference between aiming and not aiming.<br/>
<br/>
All this said, some people claim to have trained with accurate hipshooting. Certainly cowboy mythology would have you believe that speed to fire was far more important than proper aiming. But there's very little truth to that. My Great Grandfather was in a Wild West show, and had seen a few gunfights, and said, "Mostly it was about finding cover, firing blindly, and then reloading and firing more, until somebody ran away."<br/>
<br/>
So to some extent it's going to matter just how much genre conventions come into play. But realistically hipshooting is more about suppressing your enemy than it is a serious attempt to injure him.<br/>
<br/>
Then there's walking fire. With an automatic weapon, and enough rounds, you can watch where the rounds hit, and work the stream on to the target. For instance, there's really no aiming a .50 Cal machine gun by sights (actually there is, but it involves using a locking mechanism, and makes the gun more like a small canon - which it is), due to the recoil of the weapon. Instead you just adjust your aim by accounting for the round hits in each burst. Especially when you're firing at a target that's over 1000 meters away, and can barely tell what's going on at that end anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
A LMG like the M60 you can definitely walk onto the target. You can do it with assault rifles and SMGs, too, but you may run out of ammunition. For the most part these are use fully automatic in two situations. The first is for suppressive fire (keeping heads down). The second is in close quarters where you don't have time to aim. In this case you "spray fire" and pray that you've filled the air with so many rounds that one hits.<br/>
<br/>
In practice spray fire isn't very effective except at very close quarters. Only tankers are equipped with SMGs normally, to give you an idea.<br/>
<br/>
For Walking fire, I think that depth perception would impact accuracy, but not terribly. It's pretty easy to do, and adjust. For Suppressive Fire...well, "general direction" is the rule there, and often it's conducted as the "Ramallah Rainbow" where the person hold the weapon over a wall or around a corner, and doesn't even look in the direction of fire.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly I'd say depth perception would have little effect on spray fire.<br/>
<br/>
As it happens, I have a friend who has sight only in one eye (a righty without his left eyesight). And we go and play paintball frequently. And he's one of the best players I've ever seen. So...<br/>

                            You guys are awesome -- this is so much better than walking around with one eye closed, trying to throw things at stuff (especially since I can't hit things when I have both eyes open).  Although, doing so did force me to realize that my left eye is much worse than my right, and it's probably time for new glasses.                        </div>

                            I shot competitive trap for awhile when I was younger and was right eye dominant. The sight in my right has has degraded over the years to the point where if I don't have my glasses on, I have to use my left eye to aim. I'm not nearly as good with my left, but with some training, I'd say that I could get back to shooting the same scores using just my left. <br><br>I've never tried shooting from the hip with only one eye, but I can't imagine it being that much different. Your body just points the gun where it needs to go.<br><br>So, maybe a penalty for a couple of seasons until the character gets used to the loss.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Heh heh...  We've already got one character with a zombie arm, so...  But nah, Mother Esther lost her eye when her still exploded ten years back, so she's had some time to adjust to the loss.                        </div>
