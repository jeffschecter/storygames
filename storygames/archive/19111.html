It was a great session and really got me thinking about playing more of these world-building games where characters and role-playing is not the focus. I guess Microscope is a given next one up.<br/><br/>Anyway, the Contempt Tokens in the game. I really enjoyed how they expressed tension in the community. Most of all, I liked how they blurred the line between fictional tension between community factions, and real life tension between the players around the table arising out of players' decisions.<br/><br/>We had some issues with how to spend the Contempt Tokens. They can be used either to "act selfishly" or to show that tension has gone down due to an action that another player has just taken (I don't have the rules in front of me so I'm paraphrasing).  When you use the tokens to act selfishly, are they used in connection with one of the three normal actions (hold a discussion, discover something new, start a project), or is this a new (fourth) kind of action? Different players used it differently and it gave rise to some real, albeit quite amicable, tension around the table. <br/><br/>Happy to hear your thoughts!  <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Sven                      </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426517/#Comment_426517" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-03T01:13:22+00:00" title="January  3, 2014  1:13AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When you use the tokens to act selfishly, are they used in connection with one of the three normal actions (hold a discussion, discover something new, start a project)</blockquote>\nYep!

I found there was quite an ebb and flow in contempt tokens.  I built up a large stack early and mid game and gave them all away by the time the Frost Shepherds arrived. In my report I muse on how the contempt tokens have a very real effect on play.  To me they feel like karma as the term is used in early Buddhist scriptures - a representation of unfulfilled desire, frustration,  and existential pain.  In that religion when we strip away the ephemeral aspects of character and personality only the karma remains.  This goes a long way in my mind to explaining how contempt tokens support rich and dramatic role-playing in a game without characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427326/#Comment_427326" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-17T10:38:46+00:00" title="January 17, 2014 10:38AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we played TQY, one player was frustrated that contempt tokens seemed to be a sort of dangling mechanic, given a place of importance (given the strong feelings attached to them) but without a correspondingly useful role in the game mechanics.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I came to believe that the whole point of the mechanic was to explicitly indicate that nothing was going to come of your contempt.

Not sure what it would do to the game's balance in terms of action economy, though: it's pretty important that on a player's turn, they're the only one who can speak and make final decisions. So there's that.</blockquote>\nUnsure what this would model, or how you envision it changing the play dynamic.

I think it came out of a desire for those Contempt tokens to have a mechanical impact, rather than a social one. I'm not sure it's a rule I'd ever implement, really. I've played quite a few sessions of TQY, with many groups, and it's always been enjoyable. But after every single one, the players said they wished that the Contempt had more impact and each group comes up with different ideas. This was just the most recent one.<br/><br/>I suspect that this is intentional- the idea that building resentment DOESN'T cause any real change (just like Holding a Discussion ultimately results in no tangible effect except information about others' feelings).

What if, instead of piling up contempt to channel conflict in the game, it would be a 'reward token' to pile up trust and channel cooperation? Could this create a similar social dynamic, something in the spirit of: <i>'I scratch your back, you scratch mine</i>'? And could it work if this token would be <i>just </i>the token and nothing more (game-mechanically speaking)? <br/><br/>I feel that mostly, 'conflict' is often easier to attain on the social plane, but that cooperation requires more effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434048/#Comment_434048" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T21:37:21+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  9:37PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's actually the unspoken focus of the game already: if you want cooperation out of the players, you need their input.

And like... there are a finite number of people (so deaths matter) and a finite amount of weeks (so delays matter), and you have to choose how much of your resources are going to be allocated to practice-building versus... like, meat-smoker-building and water-catchment-building.<br/><br/>The speed at which trust can be built is slower than the speed at which resentment can be built, in real life, in my opinion. And so that's why the mechanics operate in that fashion.<br/><br/>But also? Try it out! Trust tokens that mirrored and paralleled Contempt tokens sound cool and interesting. I'd love to hear how it works. I'm just giving you my design notes so that you can tinker in full knowledge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/maracanda" title="maracanda"><img alt="maracanda" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/236/nYDJK66XVHRHJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/maracanda">maracanda</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434056/#Comment_434056" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-19T03:19:08+00:00" title="June 19, 2014  3:19AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks a lot.
