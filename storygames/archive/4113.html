But I get really exhausted with discussions over whether indie games are cheap or expensive. They never go anywhere. Nobody listens to each other and no resolution is ever reached: people who think they're cheap say they're cheap, people who think they're expensive say they're expensive. <br/><br/>And, of course, these discussions don't change anything. When game designers set prices, they don't think: oh, I must find that discussion on Story Games about whether indie games are too expensive.<br/><br/>Here's points you can make, on either side, to prove that indie games are either cheap or expensive. If you are a game designer who wants to charge high prices or have lots of disposable income you want to give to game designers, see section 1. If you are a consumer who wants to keep prices low or have little disposable income, see section 2.<br/><br/><b>1. Why indie games are cheap</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Compare them with other ways to spend the evening. An indie game costs \xc2\xa320. Taking five people to the cinema costs \xc2\xa340: and good indie games are more reliably good than films, theatre and TV.</li>\n<li>Compare them with other hobbies. Buying a computer game costs \xc2\xa350.</li>\n<li>Compare them with mainstream roleplaying games. They cost more: and you need to buy lots of supplements for them.

Why indie games are expensive</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Compare them with other ways to spend the evening. An indie game costs \xc2\xa320.

If you're arguing they're too expensive, it helps if you talk about <i>an average</i> indie game or <i>some</i> indie games. And, of course, the general idea that indie games are awesome pushes the argument that they're too cheap above the one they're too expensive.<br/><br/>Surely, in practice, it's much more market-driven? Game designers will charge higher prices if they can; consumers can either buy them or not.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92255/#Comment_92255" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-31T12:14:44+00:00" title="August 31, 2007 12:14PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indie Games (and RPGs generally) are expensive enough that I cannot simply saunter into an online store and buy one in order to fulfill my desire to buy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt used to be, when I was just out of college, that games were cheap enough for me to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, when I was just out of college, I was perfectly happy to drop $50 just in order to fulfill my desire to buy something.  Nowadays I'm not giddy with a sudden increase in income, and ignorant of the long-term consequences of my spending patterns.

What I'm talking about is the opportunity costs with regard to time in preperation for a game and the mental activities around gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might just be me but I find the more concentrated focus of a good indie game on one evocative premise, combined with what is usually a shorter book without some of the traditional bells and whistles means that I can read and comprehend a game *and* conjure up a workable game on the in/out journey to work on one day. I cannot do that with a traditional game. I know they are two different beasts, but as soon as I had read half of the Dictionary of Mu I was all over the concepts and uing them in a gaming (Burning Mu, coming soon...) whereas I am still struggling as to the point of Scion. I readily admit this could just be my experience and my personal foibles.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime is money though, and unless you value the game-building aspect of gaming more than the game-playing aspect, a game that gets you to the point quicker should be more valuable. And *I* find that quality in 'indie' games.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun" title="Shevaun"><img alt="Shevaun" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shevaun">Shevaun</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92406/#Comment_92406" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T02:36:28+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  2:36AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the other hand, I find that most indie games are the sort of game you play a few times, get it, and then move on, whilst something like WoD or D&amp;D (if you like them, of course) you spend your \xc2\xa320 on, and maybe get a few suppliments, and you use them again and again for years. Good investment.<br><br>I think that Indie games being available in pdf form addresses that for me. I can download and try out a game without much worry about expense - Dust Devils was about \xc2\xa33? - and buy the real thing later if I want - Dust Devils from IPR coming out to about \xc2\xa318 including postage. I like Dust Devils, I know I'm gonna play it, so its not 'expensive' anymore, its value for money. And I haven't spent much more than I would have on a big major label, which will most likely require me to buy another book anyway (City books or faction books for WoD, DMG and MM for D&amp;D, etc)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickHollingsworth" title="NickHollingsworth"><img alt="NickHollingsworth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/nKFHDCZ1ID18X.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickHollingsworth">NickHollingsworth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92409/#Comment_92409" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T03:52:31+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  3:52AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think many indie publishers are doing much more than covering their costs are they? Any product produced in small quantities is going to be relatively 'expensive'. I would not think the average indie game could be significantly cheaper without sacrificing any attempt at physical quality - and that would be bound to reduce the audience because it would imply the game was crap.<br><br>Shevaun is right that the ability to buy a PDF is a great thing. I would have though setting the cost of a PDF is more of a minefield than the cost of a paper book. The consumer knows he may face the follow on cost of the paper book later if he likes the game - I know I feel like that anyway. And from the consumers point of view there is a zero per unit cost to the supplier. But the publisher is taking a risk by providing a small market of consumers with a copy of his game that can be copied and distributed effortlessly.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92417/#Comment_92417" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T05:49:05+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  5:49AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: NickHollingsworth</cite>And from the consumers point of view there is a zero per unit cost to the supplier.</blockquote>\nWell, if the consumer is being fair, it's not QUITE zero, I'm sure.  Bandwidth and server space has some cost associated with it.  Plus, of course, no matter HOW the author/designer is selling his or her game, he or she needs to be compensated for the time spent creating it.<br><br>As a slight aside, that's a cool thing about the "Ransom Model" that Greg Stolze is using for supplements to REIGN (and also for several other previous games on his site).  Once the man has been compensated for his time and effort, the material is then free to all.  No worries about someone "pirating" the stuff and giving it away to friends for free, because it's free for everybody.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92421/#Comment_92421" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-01T06:42:38+00:00" title="September  1, 2007  6:42AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, no.

That's between $10 (piling into a car for Dreamation, which I go to free as a publisher) and $1000 (Gen Con, which cost a shitload this year, but still came out OK). The average is probably around $200 and I probably go to 6 a year.</p>\n<p>I love to eat. Love it! Designing games isn't a hobby for me. I don't have hobbies. Some things make me money, some things make me other things I need. Games make me money and are deeply satisfying to create.</p>\n<p>Now! That means that, if I sell 300 copies a year (If! When you sit down to make a game, you have no idea how successful it's gonna be, and if it's going to have to float you through your next idea. "Science Fiction like Philip K. Dick" is probably going to sell better than "Cavemen inventing culture", so Shock: is going to have to support its sequel at the beginning of history), that means that I need to invest $1500 into printing and $1200 into con-going, never mind my own efforts. So that's $2700 there. So I look at this and think, "If I sell 200 of these, and I'm charging $15 each, that's $3000. I will have made $300, which I would accept as a price to make a business card for someone, but certainly not design a game and a whole book."</p>\n<p>So I think, "What if I charge $20?" That nets me $1200 \xe2\u20ac\u201d still pretty shitty for the amount of work it takes just to write the damn thing, never mind design it from scratch. But if I charge $25, I bet I won't be able to hit my 200 copy minimum because people will compare it to other things you can do for $25, and I don't feel comfortable selling it for the same amount as The Mountain Witch. $24 sounds just like $25, so $23 it is!"</p>\n<p>You will note, however, that financial realities take hold over this principled guessing, though: Shock:1.1 now costs $24 because my printing costs went up substantially.</p>\n<p>The fundamental question, though, is the last one: "If I raise my prices by 1%, will I lose 1% of my customers? What about 2%? 3%?</p>\n<p>When those numbers cross, when I lose more customers than I gain income by increasing the price, I'm charging too much.</p>\n<p>If you think the game costs too much, don't buy it.

Consumers don't get to know exactly what value they can extract from a game before they buy it, while manufacturers aren't aware of exactly how much money the consumer is willing to pay for the game and generally has to charge the same to all consumers, even though some are willing to pay more than others (though obviously there are strategies for evading this restriction.) Lacking perfect information, producers have to position themselves relative to the rest of the market and consumers have to make a judgement on the value of the product to them.<br/><br/>Something is 'cheap' if, by accident or design, the producer sets a price lower than the consumer would have been willing to pay, or if the consumer get less value than he anticipated. It is expensive if things go the other way.<br/><br/>Generally, these 'cheap' vs. 'expensive' games discussions have focussed on the value to consumers, which is pointlessly subjective. The element due to producers making decisions about market positioning might be interesting, though.<br/><br/>This pointless and ill-informed economics rant was brought to you by,<br/>Steven                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
