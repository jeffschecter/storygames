On my side of the screen it feels like they frequently don't "come to life," and therefore blend together or are insufficiently distinguished.<br/><br/>Some NPCs I am forced to improvise at the table and some (significant NPCs intended to hammer the PCs flags or be fundamental to the story) I will think about in detail.  For these latter I'll consider with differing degrees of care their:<br/>-name<br/>-appearance / distinctive quirks<br/>-speech patterns / accent (if I can manage)<br/>-primary focus / goals<br/>-personal weakness (along the lines of which of the 7 deadly sins they are most vulnerable to / tempted by)<br/>-axis of personality (active vs planning; sincere vs manipulative; optimistic vs pessimistic; emotional vs reasoning)<br/>-What they want from the PCs / how they will target the PCs' flags<br/><br/>Even NPCs that I've spent some time before hand thinking about (using the above criteria) can come out flavorless and nebulous.  And some, even those invented on the fly, spring to life and I feel like I have an instant hold on them.  Preparation generally doesn't hurt my outcomes, but it doesn't improve the result as much or as consistently as I would like.  Therefore I think either my approach at the table or my methods of preparation are flawed.<br/><br/>I'm hoping that others of this community can share their experiences and tips in this matter.<br/><br/>So - how do you bring NPCs to life at the table?  How do you set them apart and different from other characters in the story?  Are they simply pawns by which you push a story agenda?  Or do try to invest them with goals and personalities that deepen the narrative?  Do they display flashes of the inconsistencies and contradictions that define real people?<br/><br/>You comments most welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/teucer" title="teucer"><img alt="teucer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/teucer">teucer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176434/#Comment_176434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T13:34:28+00:00" title="October 27, 2008  1:34PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your approach is broadly similar to mine, although I do it entirely out of order.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tend to run games fairly loosely, in that I keep track of what the NPCs are up to and how that's going and how it's affected by what the PCs are doing. So the first question is, "This is an NPC I've chosen to introduce into the story of these characters' adventures. What's their purpose, in that story?" Answers range from the character being a major piece of goings-on to it being some off-the-cuff guy because I needed a shopkeeper - but once I've decided to add the character in, I ask myself what their place in the story is and why that's the choice I made. For every other question I ask myself, if an answer isn't forthcoming I turn to this piece and see if it gives me an idea. Of course, sometimes the answer to this basically *is* an answer to one of the later questions, which is a bonus later on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext is the quick-and-easy version of their personality. Again, once I've got an idea of a character I'm adding I already partly know this one - but I break personality down into six pieces. The first are the main roleplaying guide, in the form of the Big Five personality traits. I mentally assign each one as either "high" or "low". The traits are: Conscientiousness (rarely relevant in gaming, but you never know), Agreeableness, Neuroticism, Openness, and Extroversion. And as a sixth piece, I decide on a particular quirk of the character to make them more memorable. Sometimes I consciously decide *not* to assign a quirk, but I always at least think about it. This approach was informed by taking intro psych and realizing how much of personality can be summarized with those five axes (although in real life they aren't binary!), while at the same time running Unknown Armies - which basically pushes you to try a specific version of the quirk thing by having a space on the sheet for "Obsession." (I'd done quirks before, but making considering them a required piece of my mental NPC checklist was something I only added a couple years ago.) The quirk might be an easily-recognizable speech pattern (such as the UA NPC who was twelve, but somewhat jarringly talked like a fairly erudite grown-up - and yes, there was a more normal adolescent around sounding plausible enough to call attention to the fact that this was a different feature of the character rather than me being unable to play a kid convincingly), although I never go so far as to do voices for my NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, it's back to what they're up to in the story. Specifically, what goals are they trying to achieve? And what do they intend to do to achieve them?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom there, I think up what, if anything, their connection is to major other NPCs in the game. Are they allies with one? Tenuously working together because their goals don't conflict too much? Bitter enemies?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the character mostly designed, now I name them. Sometimes the choice of name is meaningful, sometimes it's not - but either way, I want to pick a name that "sounds right" for the character. Naming is also how I finalize what sex the NPC is. (My rule of thumb: if nothing about the character prompts me to do otherwise, I make them female. Being male myself, I find that if I don't encourage myself to do that my worlds tend to be full of guys, since I'm slightly better at roleplaying them.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, finally, given what the PCs are up to right now, the next question is how the NPC's behavior will first interact with what the PCs are doing, and how the PCs' actions are affecting the NPC's plans. That is to say, once I've got the NPC created, I figure out how to insert them into the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like your "personal weakness" idea as something to include along the way; it's not something I'd ever thought of before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176438/#Comment_176438" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T13:37:17+00:00" title="October 27, 2008  1:37PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My friend Simon, who's the second best GM I've ever played with, likes to choose three things you can actually <i>do</i> at the table.

Ask them how they feel about something.  If NPCs are curious about getting to know the PC, it comes across... and it serves a dual role of giving "stage time" to the player.<br/><br/>2)  A picture.  But I'm very biased in this department.  A good picture can convey so many details at a glance.  body language, class, personality, in 2 seconds....<br/><br/>3)  NPCs who are there to genuinely help as best as they can in the circumstances.  Everyone needs a helping hand, the right helping hand is often reciprocated (making them great resources to threaten later on... threaten NPCs that the players like and you've just bought yourself some nice stakes.<br/><br/>4)  A good hook, no matter if they are an antagonist or an ally... a good hook is important to sell anything, including NPCs.... a niche they fill, a odd personality, a tie-in to the plot...something.  <br/><br/>5)  Antagonists need motive to mess with the PCs... find it, hit them under the belt.  <br/><br/>6)  NPCs are NOT equal.  Some are going to fall flat and to the wayside.  Incidental off-the-cuff NPCs can become central and of vast importance.  Be flexible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176514/#Comment_176514" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T02:47:23+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  2:47AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a player, the NPCs that come alive the most for me are the ones that:<br/><br/>* Have (or seem to have) an agenda that I can figure out, which interacts in some way with what my character wants to do<br/><br/>* Have a personality that varies:  they're not locked on "snotty arrogant bastard" or "obsequious toady" or whatever, they actually adjust their attitude according to what they want and how they think they need to interact with my character to get it<br/><br/>* Do stuff when my character isn't watching them; if I find out several scenes later about something they did "off camera," that's awesome<br/><br/>* Are either funny or at least show a sense of humor (this is purely personal prejudice: I don't like relentlessly emo/humorless people in real life, and I don't much care for them in games either)<br/><br/>* Leave me wanting more: every time I meet the NPC, a seed is planted for why I'd need to seek them out again<br/><br/><br/>As a GM, the NPCs that come alive the most for me are the ones that:<br/><br/>* Have an agenda I understand well enough to be able to fully participate in a conversation with them in-character; if I'm automatically plugging whatever the player characters are saying into the NPC's mindset and coming up with immediate responses, I'm fucking golden<br/><br/>* Have definite opinions about the player characters, based on how the PCs interact with him and on whatever the PCs' reputation is in the game setting, and those opinions are of the kind that encourage the NPC to keep meeting with the PCs for some reason<br/><br/>* Have some readily identifiable and easily understood flaw or blind spot; I have an easier time playing the NPC if I know there's a line they cannot cross, an addiction they cannot overcome, a belief they cannot question, etc.<br/><br/>* Are more sleazy, self-serving, and sarcastic than not (this is purely personal prejudice: I have to make room for NPCs who are not like this, but they're harder for me to really <i>get</i> the way I do the vaguely scummy NPCs)<br/><br/>* Have clearly defined resources: things they can know, things they can do, favors they can call in, equipment they can acquire (this makes it easier for me to understand how they fit into the setting and how to make them more active within it)<br/><br/><br/>There's some disparity between the NPCs I like meeting as a player and the NPCs I like running as a GM, but I'm not convinced that this is necessarily a problem: after all, I am not playing in the games I am GMing, or GMing in the games I'm playing.  If I'm GMing, all I can do is try and figure out what the people playing like in NPCs (usually by listening to them talk about which ones they like and dislike, which they do all the goddamn time) and in the meantime amuse myself with the NPCs I enjoy running.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176617/#Comment_176617" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T14:39:27+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  2:39PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My NPCs typically start as a name (often forgotten the follwing session), a vague description of appearance (always forgotten almost as soon as I've said it), and a single personality trait (always, always remembered).<br/><br/>So yeah, pick a trait and think of a couple ways you can demonstrate it, and push that hard first off. Your goals are to A) make the NPC distinct form other PCs and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> do so in a memorable way.<br/><br/>If and when the NPC comes up again, you may wish to introduce a second trait, perhaps in opposition to the first. Doen well, this should look like character depth being revealed, rather than an arbitrary shift in personality.<br/><br/>Vast numbers of my NPCs ending up being shaped by accident. Just the other day I forgot to have an NPC speak for a while, and one of the players remarked on this. I covered by saying the NPC had mysteriously disappeared while they'd been distracted talking to another guy, and from there confabulated a secret agenda for the NPC that had previously been entirely concealed. So my NPCs that get a lot of screen time tend to end up automatically complicated by the action of play, even thought they started out very one-note.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_176742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176742/#Comment_176742" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T16:24:21+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  4:24PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2008 4:34PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Storn: engage the player characters with your NPC.<br/><br/>Try this: make an NPC that is solely for the purpose of befriending the characters, create a situation where this may happen, and leave all else be and engage in your NPC in direct dialogue with the characters (on a pub, or at a banquet, or similar). Let the NPC be friendly and contact-seeking in a way you deem positive in the situation.<br/><br/>Then try this: make a servant for the players, or a mother, or any other NPC that can be a bit irritating, but at the same time quite caring, and play it out in some down-to-earth everyday scene. Don't be clever, only work the relation. If you use the mother of a PC, be sure to use her in a situation that includes the other PCs too, making it a scene where they all learn to know this character (and his mother) a bit better.<br/><br/>And then try this: make an opponent for the characters in some verbal conflict of the political or social type. Instruct the players that no dice will decide this. They must beat your NPC on the terms of a real discussion (choose a conflict on a field they know). Then you dive into the arguments with vigor, and press your agenda on them by any conceivable verbal/intellectual means. Try to make the conflict end as unresolved, with hard(ened) principles standing against each other (this may frustrate the players, but will be a good build up for further encounters with the NPC, and may be a valuable lesson for you).<br/><br/>When these three tasks has been done, sit down and think it through: what did you learn? What made it come alive, and what made it not?<br/><br/><i>BTW: do not go through your normal stages of creating the NPC's for this. Give them a name and occupation only.

They're the ones the players care about. Once that happens, it's easy to develop the NPCs in response to how the players interact with them--push a little here, pull a little there, and deepen both intimate bonds and points of conflict.<br/><br/>David Berg also posted this on the Forge a few days ago, and I thought it belonged here:\n<blockquote><br/>My current character sheets include lists of "things you do when pleased", "things you do when displeased", and "things you do for no reason".  Stuff like picking teeth, scratching scalp, and humming can provide that perfect dose of extra color when called for.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
