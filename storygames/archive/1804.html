                    I was surprised to hear that the Provosts were unable to come to MACE. I had signed up for a couple of the games they were running. Fortunately, Jason Morningstar leaped into the fray and heroically ran more than his share of events. This included Cold City (Saturday, noon)and Dogs in the Vineyard (Saturday, 8pm slot).<br/>
<br/>
I had never played DiTV until this game. I purchased the game almost 2 years before and couldn't get my "regular" game group to try it. Jason's Saturday game was a last minute choice. I was the only person signed up for the game at 4pm. Luckily, the game filled up nicely at kickoff.<br/>
<br/>
Who was playing? Well, there was a young guy named Joshua who claimed he'd only been roleplaying for a year. Next, there was a man named, I think, Jeff. I remember Jeff from last year at the Burning Wheel "The Gift" game, where he made me laugh with his hedonist, greed smacked dwarven Prince Vost. Jeff didn't disappoint this time either. His Dog was a polite but stern man who didn't appreciate family breakups or barley tea. Between Jeff and I was David Artman (who I learned later was also the Looney Labs guy at the con). David's Dog (Brother Abraham) was book learned, righteous, stubborn, and unable to fist fight or shoot straight. Finally, there was my Dog, Brother Clyde, who had murdered a Steward but converted to the Faith and was made into a Dog. <br/>
<br/>
Jason quickly had us making up our Dogs and running us through our initiations. Since he murdered a Steward, and was new to the Faith, Brother Clyde had no family I wondered who was going to make my coat. Jason wanted to know what my conflict was during initiation. I said it would have to be about me either accepting my guilt over the murder or having that guilt hang like burden for all my days as a Dog. Then, in the very back of my mind, I had a really terrible thought. Jason, used his evil mind powers, turned to me and said "I have something in mind..."<br/>
<br/>
I had an inkling, a tickle of a thought that it was the Steward's widow who was going to make the coat. But, no, that would be so *wrong*. And, of course, Jason announced that one night, there was a knock at the door. It was, of course, the Widow... with my coat. Unnnngh! No!! It was perfect. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is why I liked the game so much - in 30 minutes the emotional content was already scoring hits with me. I can recall playing other RPGs for years and years and rarely ever making such an impact on me as a player. But, here, in just the opening conflict I was hooked in and stamped under Jason's heel. I loved it.<br/>
<br/>
The branch we were assigned to was a minority in a larger town. We learned almost immediately that the town's young folk were being loosed at age 17 for a "runaround." The idea is that the young people get to live outside of the Faith for a year and if they choose to come back the Faith know their heart is sincere. Otherwise, there is shunning.<br/>
<br/>
I should mention the infamous "Barley Tea' incident before I forget. Jeff's Dog was listening to one of the town's married men speak on about how their (heretical) take on Faithful doctrine was indeed, correct. Jeff had his Dog throw his barley tea on this guy, with some hard words about their false doctrines, etc. The man's defense collapsed in short order and he gave, knowing he had been beaten by a Dog armed with tea.<br/>
<br/>
There was another ex-Faithful NPC in town who ran a photography shop. When she saw us enter and recognized our coats, she unloaded a verbal cannonade that literally had all four adult men gasping in horror at her blasphemous words and shocking, unwomanly manners. To me, that was a great moment, one that had us shouting and making a commotion. <br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, I'm not sure we fixed the town (time was a factor), but we had a lot of fun trying. We had a titanic battle with a Baptist cooper who married an "shunned" Faithful woman to allow her to come to church on the Sabbath. Since the town was mixed, there was a real threat from the cooper that the Baptist majority would "run out" the Faithful. Escalating to guns didn't appear to be a long term viable strategy, although there was a fair amount of head bashing. I can recall this man standing tall, getting rolls like the Devil himself was casting the dice, and turning us back again and again.<br/>
<br/>
I can't recall all the great moments - I hope Jason or anyone else who was there can fill in the gaps.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, and perhaps the best part, my friend Jon happened to be watching us play and sat next to me to observe. He was so taken by out engaged play that he demanded that our "regular" group give Dogs in the Vineyard a try. I'm happy to say that we'll be doing just that as soon as we can.                </div>

                            Thanks, James, that's a great write-up!<br/><br/>FYI I based Plover Fold on the Amish practice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumspringa" rel="nofollow"><i>rumspringa</i></a>, which I learned about in the documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293088/" rel="nofollow">The Devil's Playground</a>.  It's very easy to build a Dogs town around a song or film or book.  The town write-up is <a href="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/dogs/resources.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>One thing about this session that was interesting to me was that it was very, very low key - no demonic possession or sorcerers, just folks.  There was never any gunplay (although a shotgun was fired in the air).  I wish we'd had more time - 4 Dogs, 10 NPCs of varying importance (they interacted with 7), four hours wasn't quite enough.                        </div>

                            To steer away from the cool Actual Play moments and all...<br/><br/>Yeah, my experience is that Dogs in the Vineyard in the hands of Jason is like Burning Wheel in the hands of Luke, or HeroQuest in the hands of Mike H.  When he picks up the book you can actually hear an audiable "click" as the book interfaces with his hands.<br/><br/>There's a lot to be said about the Right Game for the Right GM.  When Jason mentioned that he'd run an extra game of Dogs (he originally planned Cold City and all, but Dogs was last minute) I was really happy: It's a game that needs to be run at Cons, simply because it's pure hardcore fun and drama in four hours. And in the hands of Jason, it's like a sniper rifle in the hands of an elite mercenary.<br/><br/>My first ever game of Dogs was also the first time that I ever met Jason; he ran a one-on-one game for me (since the event we went to had lots of cancellations, and we didn't feel like just talking about games), and seriously it sold me on the game as a concept and a tool of fun. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
