                    Well, in the spirit of the recent threads where the community goes to house on games, giving them a "second round", and because I think my own game can benefit from such discussion, especially of this editorial kind(The biggest difference in my game's versions is the presentation, rather than actual content).<br/><br/>So, I asked Chad Underkoffler to take a look at <a href="http://craniumrats.pbwiki.com" rel="nofollow">Cranium Rats</a> again, and everything following is what he said, re-posted with permission(in fact, he suggested I post it here). I'll answer in a following message.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>Guy:<br/><br/>I had to stop reading the file at page 25. You are making this<br/>game much, much harder to read/understand than it needs to be,<br/>by introducing rules complexities and special features<br/>willy-nilly, then being very roundabout in explaining them. You<br/>can cut a LOT of text out and be much clearer.<br/><br/>OVERARCING QUESTIONS:<br/>* Why, for such a psychological/metaphysical game, are you using<br/>extremely gritty, nonfantastic examples? I think you're trying<br/>to pull back the curtain on conflict to show the underlying<br/>psychological motivations, and that's cool. But you never say<br/>that.<br/><br/>* Why are all your examples fairly real world, and then you drop<br/>in these bits of metaphysical prose?<br/><br/>* Why do Story Tokens turn into Mechanics Tokens? Why not just<br/>keep them the same thing? Why not just stick with using dice?<br/><br/>* Why introduce Aspect Dots? Why not use Aspect dice?<br/><br/>Here's my attempt below, taking mostly your own words from the<br/>file (though I have added my own), and at least building the<br/>foundation/outline for the game. Use or trash as you desire.<br/><br/>===================================<br/>CRANIUM RATS (Underkoffler Partial Remix)<br/><br/>WHAT IS THIS GAME?<br/>This game is all conflict, all the time. There is no room for<br/>cuddly feelings, unless you use them to overcome your friends.<br/>There is no room for not owning up when the power to set the<br/>stage is yours.<br/><br/>Gameplay is aimed at duplicating the underlying psychological<br/>motivations behind furious, interwoven storylines that begin to<br/>criss-cross more and more and eventually culminate together, as<br/>seen in movies like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,<br/>Snatch!, Layer Cake, and Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>In this game, players do NOT play individual characters; they<br/>play the psychological Aspects of several characters: the<br/>â€œCranium Rats.â€ The Cranium Rats control these characters,<br/>pulling and pushing them around in their struggle to achieve<br/>their Goals. The players -- as Cranium Rats -- take turns<br/>narrating the actions and events of each character, focusing on<br/>the particular Aspect and Goal they are embodying for that<br/>player.<br/><br/>With players often taking control of the same character, play is<br/>all about conflict: internal and external. Cranium Rats games<br/>can be deeply psychological, high-octane action, or ironically<br/>macabre.<br/><br/>Cranium Rats works best with at least 3 or 4 players.<br/><br/>THE ASPECTS<br/><br/>[ INSERT triangle of aspects; place "Enlightened" in center of<br/>triangle ]<br/><br/>Each player will play all three Aspects (one Dirt, one Rat and<br/>one Water), but divided over three characters. It will result in<br/>each character having the three Aspects, but a different player<br/>will play each.<br/><br/>A fourth player plays the Enlightened for all the characters in<br/>the game, and serves as a referee, mediator, or arbitrator in<br/>cases of game-stopping conflict or confusion.<br/><br/>ALTERNATELY, each player can play all FOUR Aspects (one Dirt,<br/>one Rat, one Water, and one Enlightened), but divided over FOUR<br/>characters.<br/><br/>Dirt<br/>Dirt is the ant. It is the part that on one hand builds great<br/>monuments, for society, for itself, but on the other hand is a<br/>faceless peon. Dirt is the mother and father. It is that which<br/>care for continuity, for the societyâ€™s well being. You return to<br/>dirt from whence you came; dirt is the â€œhuman experienceâ€. Dirt<br/>is the effort you put into it to draw nourishment from it. Dirt<br/>is the effort you put into building society and its structures<br/>from it. Dirt is where you inter your forebears for safekeeping,<br/>into which you hope to be interred in the future.<br/><br/>Dirt is Society. Dirt is slow and gradual, stable growth.<br/>Dirt is what most humans claim to be or wish to be seen as on<br/>the surface.<br/><br/>Dirt is Organization.<br/>Dirt is Cooperation.<br/>Dirt is Thought.<br/><br/><br/>Rat<br/>Rat is the darkness behind your eyes. It is every animal or gut<br/>instinct that you have and which needs suppression or heed. Rat<br/>is the sex and the violence. It is that which you wish you could<br/>be, the power that guides you, if youâ€™d let it. The urge to<br/>reproduce, yhe urge of survival. saving you and yours. Mindless<br/>actions. The need to prove yourself; your foot on your fallen<br/>enemyâ€™s chest. The way in which fear transmits like a disease in<br/>a crowded rat-den, the pheromone control we exert and that is<br/>exerted upon us. Rat is what most humans draw their strength<br/>from but wish to repress.<br/><br/>Rat is the Individual. Rat is fast and explosive; Rat often<br/>destroys. Rat is what most humans hide from others.<br/><br/>Rat is Division.<br/>Rat is Initiative.<br/>Rat is Urges.<br/><br/>Water<br/>Water is the mirror. Its shape and behaviour change as you act<br/>in different manners toward it. Water is constant. Try to tell<br/>the mighty river to not flow. Put a stone in the path of the<br/>brook and it will simply flow over or to the side. Water changes<br/>and is changed by the environment.<br/>Water is the need to keep on moving, to shape environment and be<br/>shaped by it. It is the need to escape those who will restraint<br/>you, the need to push others into conforming with you.<br/><br/>Water is the Moment. Water is changeable and flowing; Water<br/>creates and destroys. Water is how most humans appear to<br/>others.<br/><br/>Water is Change.<br/>Water is Movement.<br/>Water is Reaction.<br/><br/><br/>The Enlightened<br/>The Enlightened is the world and all within it, the Enlightened<br/>is the Godhead, but he is also the illusion that keeps those who<br/>still sleep within it. The Enlightened is to be impartial; which<br/>is to say, he is equally against all the Aspects. He is rooting<br/>for the characters, for if they reach Enlightenment is gives him<br/>joy, that other throw off the shackles that he did before. He<br/>doesnâ€™t help an Aspect that fell behind, heâ€™s merely hindering<br/>the one ahead.<br/><br/>The Enlightened is the Future. The Enlightened is the ultimate<br/>goal. The Enlighted is the sum of all things. The Enlightened is<br/>unseen and unknown to most humans.<br/><br/><br/>ASPECT RELATIONS &amp; TRAITS<br/>Aspects do not exist in a void; they interact with one another.<br/>As such, certain relationships between them emerge.<br/><br/>These relationships also give rise to the basic Traits of<br/>individual characters.<br/><br/>Dirt and Water give a character their Physical trait (Clay).<br/>Dirt and Rat give a character their Mental trait (Personality).<br/>Rat and Water give a character their Social trait (Imeptus).<br/><br/>As the strength of Aspects in a particular character change,<br/>both their characterization AND their Traits alter slightly.<br/><br/>As Dirt rises in relation to Water, the Clay becomes harder but<br/>also more brittle. Rat is given more protection, but it has a<br/>harder time shifting its position.<br/><br/>As Water rises in relation to Dirt, the Clay becomes more<br/>malleable, but also harder to keep in form. Rat is given less<br/>protection, but finds it harder to move and shape its<br/>surrounding area.<br/><br/>As Rat rises in relation to Dirt, the Personality becomes more<br/>bestial. The person becomes more prone to act based on his urges<br/>and instincts, the body becomes paramount. Water is being<br/>controlled.<br/><br/>As Dirt rises in relation Rat, the personality becomes more<br/>refined. The person becomes more detached and aloof from his<br/>surroundings. The mind becomes paramount. Water is being<br/>channeled.<br/><br/><br/>SETTING UP<br/>Before character creation, a basic genre, setting, and "rating"<br/>for the game should be picked, and game materials need to be<br/>assembled.<br/><br/> </div>

<br/><br/>Genres include: crime, wild west, action, police drama, family<br/>drama, kung fu, etc.<br/><br/>Settings include: modern day London, a small mining town in<br/>1850, within a computer simulation, an inner-city police<br/>precinct, a hospital ER, Japan in 1650, etc.<br/><br/>Ratings include the "comfort level" of the players in terms of<br/>the sex, violence, and bleakness of the content and graphic<br/>descriptions of these.<br/><br/>Game materials include paper, pencils, copies of the character<br/>sheets, a copy of these rules, and a LOT of six-sided dice.<br/><br/><br/>CHARACTER CREATION<br/><br/>Each Aspect -- and thus each player -- has a different set of<br/>priorities and responsibilities during character creation. The<br/>characterâ€™s concept, history, personality and so on will be<br/>created as play progresses, by sketching in the broadest strokes<br/>you leave more space for fine-tuning later.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a blank character sheet in front of<br/>them. They will all work on the Dirt Aspect of one character,<br/>then pass the character sheet clockwise for the next Aspect.<br/><br/>DIRT<br/>Dirtâ€™s player:<br/>* Writes his own name under "Dirt" on the character sheet.<br/>* Comes up with a two to seven word description of the<br/>character.<br/>* Assigns four dice between the character's Traits (Clay,<br/>Personality, and Impetus).<br/>* Picks one Specialty for the character and assigns one die to<br/>it. Specialties may include hobbies, profession, areas of<br/>knowledge, social status, wealth and other temporal things.<br/>These help the character when they can be brought to bear in<br/>conflicts. Specialties cannot be personality-based, such as<br/>friendly or pessimistic,<br/>since the Aspects cover personality.<br/>* Pick one Goal for the character that relates to things Dirt<br/>entails.<br/><br/>Pass the sheets clockwise.<br/><br/>RAT<br/>Rat's player:<br/>* Writes his own name under "Rat" on the character sheet.<br/>* Adds one to four words to the character description (if<br/>desired).<br/>* Assigns two dice between the character's Traits.<br/>* Assigns three dice for Specialites -- can be the old one<br/>picked by Dirt, wholly new ones, or any combination.<br/>* Pick one Goal for the character that relates to things Rat<br/>entails.<br/>* Gives the character a name.<br/><br/>Pass the sheets clockwise.<br/><br/>WATER<br/>Water's player:<br/>* Writes his own name under "Water" on the character sheet.<br/>* Adds one word to the character description (if desired).<br/>* Assigns five dice between the character's existing Traits or<br/>Specialties (no new ones!).<br/>* Pick one Goal for the character that relates to things Water<br/>entails.<br/>* Gives the character a connection to one other character.<br/><br/>THE ENLIGHTENED<br/>The Enlightenedâ€™s player:<br/>* Writes his own name under "The Enlightened" on the character<br/>sheet.<br/>* Gives each Aspect of the character 5 dice.<br/>* Gives the character a connection to one other character (not<br/>the same other character from the Water phase).<br/>* Tells the players where the character starts within the<br/>setting.<br/>* Gives the final character sheet for the character to the<br/>player who is that character's Rat.<br/>* Tells the player to his left to start the story.<br/><br/>===================================<br/><br/>That takes us up to pages 17/18. Other things I'd do:<br/>* Replace the Tokens with dice -- players give each other dice<br/>to take narration, trade character sheets, force conflicts,<br/>force a character to switch to another one of their Goals,<br/>insert another character into the scene, other wagers, influence<br/>the Enlightened to have something happen to the setting as a<br/>whole (earthquake, traffic jam, etc.), and stuff like that.<br/><br/>* Characters can use the dice they get for this stuff, or plunk<br/>them into various Aspects to improve them.<br/><br/>* Goal of the game is to get the highest Score in the Aspects<br/>they control over all the players. A perfect win would be<br/>getting 10 in the Aspects you are in control of for each<br/>character. (So player A wants a 10 in Dirt for PC1, a 10 in Rat<br/>for PC2, a 10 in Water for PC3, and -- maybe -- a 10 in the<br/>Enlightened for PC4.)                        </div>

These are more important to me, or at least, I feel better able to answer them now, I will be unable to visit the remix 'till Monday due to doing a night-shift on the army today(Sunday).<br/><br/>1) First, the source material is gritty. Second and much more mundane, most of the examples are taken from the playtest sessions I ran, and this is what we had.<br/>Now, for the meat of the answer, rather than the technical terms. I want this to be about everyday people, everyday life. Just like most characters in movies/books are before something happens that disturbs the balance. Fuck the special ones, give me the ordinary ones to showcase how fucked up things can become. Like Unknown Armies mundanes.<br/>Also, on the psychological front, you're right, I curtain it, I want it to be emergant during play. I plan to start a thread about a playtest session that did not occur that will showcase this, I am still not sure where to post it, though the new GameCraft seems to be a good fit.<br/><br/>2) That's part of the "Feel", you can call it colour, or you can say that I use it to show the grand scale on which things go, albeit in the background. Most of the "Legends" are also allegories for the relationships between the Aspects, the Enlightened and the character.<br/><br/>3) I began with those two token types and combined them, playtesting moved me to seperate them once more. The Tokens are the only totally non-tested part of the game, so take it as what it is, a solution to a problem, but not necessarily the optimal one. The problem of mechanical versus narrative control.<br/>Why not use dice? Because the Tokens belong to players, whereas dice belong to individual Aspects.<br/><br/>4) Just like Willpower in White-Wolf games, you have your permanent rating which goes towards winning and losing, and the dice, which are renewable and diminishable resource.                        </div>

                            I have to agree about the organization; the text of Cranium Rats has this tendency to reference rules and say "I'll explain this soon, so sit tight" a whole lot. I want to see the rules organized to that I can read it front to back and fully get the parts I've read so far rather than waiting for new pieces of the puzzle to come in. I still have a hard time really wrapping my head around how the rules would fit together in play.<br/><br/>On the other hand I thought using nonfantastic examples was kind of the point. There's a strong tradition of using gritty settings for deeply philosophical stuff, in films like those cited as inspiration and in literary fiction for that matter. Maybe they could stand to be a little more Chuck Palahniuk though, a little more crazy and in-your-face, but I think they fit with what you're after in the game.<br/><br/>One of the things I've been surprised at reading Yuuyake Koyake (that cute Japanese RPG about animals that take human form to help people) is how the designer managed to make the (warm and fuzzy) tone of things permeate the game text without losing clarity. Certain things are specific to the Japanese language, but in general he chooses his terms carefully and uses them consistently; there's now "How to Play" or "Rules" chapter, but rather "How To Enjoy Stories" (ç‰©èªžã®æ¥½ã—ã¿æ–¹), and generally writes with a voice that sounds like someone's pleasantly reading you a children's story. While in some ways I like the measured rules, almost belligerent footnotes, and lucid dream philosophical interludes in the current draft of Cranium Rats, I wonder if you might be able to pull it off with a more unified tone. Make me feel like a madman is having a moment of clarity and is whispering the secrets of the universe to me. Or something. But this is something that can definitely wait.                        </div>

                            I'll answer to Ewen and hopefully the answer will also provide for Chad's underlying points, rather than specific issues, but first a small answer to Chad.<br/><br/>Genres/Settings are something I actively <b>don't</b> want as I want the option of stories to mirror one another by not being in the same settings; like a cowboy rising to protect his town with a woman on the doorstep to divorcing her husband(Yes, it can even be <i>that</i> gritty - in fact, that's often deeper-penetrating).<br/><br/>I want the manual to have a measured voice, a blank voice. My other project(which is still only inside my head), Alone, will hopefully be written in one in-character voice that transmits the feel of the game. Reading games like Polaris always puts me in awe, but I don't see any voice for this game to have. The footnotes are less "The Competitive Voice" and more "Guy Shalev's Voice".<br/><br/>As for the way in which rules are presented, I took the way I've been using from Sydney Freedberg's Ronnies version of <a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Apocalypse_Girl.php" rel="nofollow">Apocalypse Girl</a>. That's the way I found most suiting to me thus far. Though I admit to being annoyed by it while reading the game, afterwards I accepted internally that I could see no other way to do it.<br/><br/>The methods for rules-writing that I have noticed thus far are:<br/><br/>Write about A, if it mentions B, C and D, only explain them in that later section, perhaps not even mention them in section A, and only refer back to it in sections B, C and D.<br/>Write about A, if it mentions B, C or D, make a break in the rules, explain B, C or D and then return to section A; this breaks the flow of A and drives me mad, most game-texts I see use this method.<br/>Write about A, mention B, C and D, explain them as best as you can now, and later when you write sections B, C and D, explain them again, in full this time, and refer to section A as appropriate, which is what I did.<br/><br/>This solves the 12*12=? issue from our prior email discussion Chad, I refer to a rule, I give a small explanation of it, and in the appropriate section explain it again. There is also the part where I explain things numerous times, to ease remembering them. In Dice I explain what you can do with the various Tokens in regards to Dice. In Tokens, I say what you can do with Dice, and again bring up the various ways in which Dice interact with Tokens.<br/><br/>If I sound defensive, that's not my intent, I just want to explain the <i>why</i> of the <i>how</i>, so our dialogue would be able to progress further.                        </div>

I would seriously consider foregrounding the point.

Then you're missing the middle bit: where the reader goes from the gritty details to the big picture. You've got to connect the two in your discussion, otherwise, the reader gets confused.

Why not just give players dice of their own? <br/><br/>Indeed, I started thinking last night that the PLAYERS should all have a sheet, listing:<br/>* The character they play Dirt for, and that character's Dirt goal.<br/>* The character they play Rat for, and that character's Rat goal.<br/>* The character they play Water for, and that character's Water goal.<br/>* The character they play the Enlightened for, and that character's Enlightened goal (if that option is used).<br/><br/>Then give the player dice or Tokens or whatever that fits on that PLAYER SHEET.<br/><br/>So the player has a character sheet (starts with character they are Rat for, but could be/should be switched during play) and a player sheet (which they keep permanently).<br/><br/>
<blockquote>4) Just like Willpower in White-Wolf games, you have your permanent rating which goes towards winning and losing, and the dice, which are renewable and diminishable resource.</blockquote>
Why not make one's resources (which can be used, renewed, diminished, expanded) a factor in winning or losing?<br/><br/>SIDE ISSUE: I dislike the name of the game being "Cranium Rats" and there's only one Rat aspect. The idea is you have these Cranium Rats in your head that run your life, yes? So Dirt's a Cranium Rat, correct?<br/><br/>Ideas:<br/>* Call "Rat Aspect" something else like "Beast Aspect"<br/>* Call the other Aspects "The Rat of (whatever)" so all of the Aspects are Rats. In this case, I'd call them the Rats of Earth (Dirt), Air (Rat), Water (Water), and Fire (Enlightenment).<br/><br/>CU                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Genres/Settings are something I actively<b>don't</b>want as I want the option of stories to mirror one another by not being in the same settings; like a cowboy rising to protect his town with a woman on the doorstep to divorcing her husband(Yes, it can even be<i>that</i>gritty - in fact, that's often deeper-penetrating).</blockquote>
A mixed-setting can be a setting. I don't see the problem. Just mention the WWII soldier and his grandson's parallel stories concept as a setting. Perfectly valid.
<blockquote>I want the manual to have a measured voice, a blank voice. My other project(which is still only inside my head), Alone, will hopefully be written in one in-character voice that transmits the feel of the game. Reading games like Polaris always puts me in awe, but I don't see any voice for this game to have. The footnotes are less "The Competitive Voice" and more "Guy Shalev's Voice".</blockquote>
Guy, seriously, this isn't a measured or blank voice in the CR manuscript. It's kind of snotty and superior, while being vague and disjointed. <br/><br/>Game manuscripts are first and foremost technical documentation for a process. That is the core. They need to be as clear and unambiguous as possible. Art and style can -- and should -- inform that core, but they should not overtake it.<br/><br/>Write your game out as a series of bullet points first (philosophy, descriptions, mechanics). Then turn that into text -- that's where the style comes in.<br/><br/>At least, that's my process.
<blockquote>The methods for rules-writing that I have noticed thus far are:<br/>Write about A, if it mentions B, C and D, only explain them in that later section, perhaps not even mention them in section A, and only refer back to it in sections B, C and D.<br/>Write about A, if it mentions B, C or D, make a break in the rules, explain B, C or D and then return to section A; this breaks the flow of A and drives me mad, most game-texts I see use this method.<br/>Write about A, mention B, C and D, explain them as best as you can now, and later when you write sections B, C and D, explain them again, in full this time, and refer to section A as appropriate, which is what I did.</blockquote>
Or, what I do:<br/>Write about A. Write about B. Write about C. Write about D. Describe how A, B, C, and D interrelate.<br/><br/>This differs from your second example in that you need to define your terms before you describe how they work. FIRST tell us what they all are. THEN tell us what they all do.<br/><br/>You're trying to tell us what they are, and what they do (in detail), without giving us all the pieces.<br/><br/>If you want, tell us what they are, and then what they are related to and what they do generally, but not the nitty-gritty details of how they do what they do. Save that for later, until you get all the involved terms defined and described.<br/><br/>IMAO, of course.<br/><br/>CU                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>First, do you think the text is an improvement over the last version</blockquote>
Sure. I think I was able to read five more pages before tiring of hacking through the text.
<blockquote>Second, I still need to know what you think of the game, even though that's neither here nor there.</blockquote>
Guy: I <b>cannot</b> read far enough into your text to get to the game mechanics. I get bored and tired going through the text. This is a problem. Especially as I edit huge chunks of highly technical telecom standards every day at work (as a non-engineer), and they give me less agita than your game.<br/><br/>Your game concept, as I understand it, is interesting. The implementation of it is impenetrable to me, because of the method of organization, the lack of clarity in description, the lack of connection between the metaphysical aspects of the text and the focus on the gritty-type stories the game is intended to produce, the generation of new and different terminology at every turn, and the vaguely superior and snide tone.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if that comes off as harsh, but that's how I feel.
<blockquote>Third, I forgot to address that point. The Enlightened role is not to be transferred, and that's crucial. If you screw me as Rat on character <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, I'll screw you as Dirt on character <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>. The Enlightened needs to stay the same, with no owes/vendettas. If I could help it, the Enlightened would be a stranger to the other players who has no emotions/feelings towards them at all.</blockquote>
Fair enough. I personally think then, from what I read (granted, it's a limited page count on my part), the Enlightened has precious little to do as such. However, there could be more stuff later in the book that I didn't penetrate to.
<blockquote>Hm, Cranium Rats and the Rat, yes, it is an issue. All Aspects are basically "Cranium Rats", I may take your advice of making Rat Fire(he is change like that, the Wyrm if you would).

I think making "Rat" into "The Rat of Fire" works well -- I initially had it that way, but then thought about the Enlightened. If you're set on keeping The Enlightened in a GM role, call him the Rat King or the Ratcatcher or even the Pied Piper.

I think that having a resource that you can either use to "win the game" or "win the die roll" (in essence, sacrificing one for the other) leads to interesting play and decision-making. Is it worth giving up enlightenment or achievement of a goal to win? (This is essentially what I did with Soul Points in <i>Dead Inside</i>, for example.)
<blockquote>I did consider doing two sheets, it is a good idea.</blockquote>
I highly, highly, highly recommend it. Think of the physicality of gameplay: who holds what, when. <br/><br/>CU                        </div>

                            There are three points or so when I say "Insert chart", under the relevant "Flow" sections, I then suffered from some burn-out and didn't do those flow-charts. I am also incapable of making graphics that don't look like shit, so it's still on the to-do list.<br/><br/>This is definitely my fault and my responsebility, but I'm not sure when I'll get to that.<br/>There's also John Kirk's discussion of how the mechanics inter-relate(slightly out of date now) that may still be useful to see some relations between different resources, or just confuse people further?                        </div>

                            I have already critiqued this game for Guy in a previous edition. On Chad's review, and on Guy asking me to look at it, I went and looked at the current version. In short, I agree with Chad. The game is not as bad as it was previously in terms of being able to absorb it, but I, too, can't get the idea of how play happens from the text.<br/>
<br/>
At first I thought I was being lazy or something, perhaps, and that I should just try harder. I'm glad Chad has had the same experience, so that I can say that it's not just me.<br/>
<br/>
Guy, with any text, part of making it readable is grabbing the reader. Even with a textbook, you have to at least present the material so that the reader has a base of understanding to work on to see what it is he's learning. And then you build on that. And the reader follows along, because he feels he's accomplishing something in the act of reading.<br/>
<br/>
With your game... what's it about? You say it should give output like "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels." I love that movie. But then all of a sudden there's these metaphysical passages that have so little to do with the supposed source material from my POV that I can't reconcile the two at all. You'd do better if you just axed them from the text. They are impenetrable.<br/>
<br/>
As for the A including B, C and D problem...introduce B, C and D first. It's that simple. That is, instead of saying:<br/>
<br/>
"Roll a d6. We'll explain later what a D6 is."<br/>
<br/>
Say:<br/>
<br/>
"A d6 is your standard die. Now you roll it."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I get a feeling that some of the problem is grammatical. I know that everyone in Israel learns English, but this is not English that I am used to. Like you write:<br/>
<br/>
"You may offer to buy narration rights from a player whose turn it is by giving<br/>
him a story token (which becomes a mechanics token for him), once he picked<br/>
the character, though you can ask him to do so before he picks the character,<br/>
though as always, he is under no obligation to meet your request."<br/>
<br/>
That's a run on sentence, and lacks unity of tense and person. I'd write:<br/>
<br/>
"On a player's turn any player may offer to buy narration rights from him, giving him a story token if he accepts  (if so, the Story Token is converted into a Mechanics token). This can be done before or after he picks the character for the scene."<br/>
<br/>
If the rule above is not correct, it's because I couldn't get the correct rule from the text you wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Phrases like "he is under no obligation to meet your request" are redundant, and send the reader looking for why you would have to say the same thing twice. Was there some exception I missed in reading, thinks the reader.<br/>
<br/>
Is there some mechanical point to having to point out that the player can buy narration before or after the character selection? If not, then it should be:<br/>
<br/>
"On a player's turn you may offer to buy narration rights from him, giving him a story token if he accepts. This Story Token is converted into a Mechanics token. This can at any point until just after the player has selected the character for the scene."<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps better for the last sentence something like: "...any point before he begins narration." Because as written the rule doesn't seem to have any purpose. It could, I just can't see it from the text.<br/>
<br/>
Between grammatical problems, apparent intentional obfuscation in the rules, and reverse presentation of concepts - as Chad says - the text is unreadable.<br/>

                            The following point should very well deserve its own thread, but I'm less interested in general response to the issue right now.<br><br>One thing to take from the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22209.0" rel="nofollow">Does System Matter?</a> thread on the Forge is that the game-text is also part of the System.<br><br>If I keep telling you that the game is supposed to create stories which deal with moral issues, ala DitV, I think if I said it enough times it'd happen even if I didn't have any mechanical impetus for it.<br><br>So it is my belief, that at least for playtest documents you don't discuss what kind of play should emerge, or how it should emerge too much, and wait for the playtest reports to see if the System brings those issues forth without your prompting(same as the game ran by the designer can do what the designer wants even if the game itself can't).<br><br>It's the same as why I didn't include the Meta-Chanics in the earlier version of the document.<br><br>Thoughts?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            It has been a while since I sat down and powered through the text for Cranium Rats, but from what I remember of assisting in the upgrading of one of the versions...I think the text is a stage or two too thick between the reader and what it is trying to say. <br>
<br>
I would recommend, from what I've read of your doings over on Gamcraft, just writing everything down in plain-as-day bullet point format. Encode it into text later, but make sure that, somewhere, there is a clear explanation of what all is what and what needs doing when.                        </br></br></div>

                            Well, a bit of ressurection here. I'm looking at something specific you said Mike, and I know I have a problem with that, so I'll ask you for elaboration:
<blockquote>but I, too, can't get the idea of how play happens from the text.</blockquote>
In a way I have a problem even comprehending this remark. As far as I know, and which is what I'm doing, you present all the pieces in order, and then the people do each thing by its turn, and that's the game-play happening.<br>Why do you need to get the picture when you only need to deal with one quarter at a time?<br><br>Also, look at the "Fruitful Void", these and other hidden subtleties of game can only be reached by actually playing the game, and not from a mental model.<br><br>Please advise.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            To be more clear, it's not that I need to have some mental model. It's that the instructions on the step-by-step process are unclear. I don't believe it's because they're incomplete, neccessarily. Just that I can't understand some of the procedures from the text. And, again, I don't think that it's because you've done something grammatically wrong or something neccessarily. But because the way it's presented, the reader is being asked to keep a lot in his head at any one time, and make the new concepts fit with the recalled old concepts.<br/>
<br/>
And, since it's boring, I can't remember the old concepts. Part of why it's boring is because I can't figure out what Concept A is about. So by the time Concept C references Concept A, I'm totally lost.<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to be precise here, and am failing to be accurate in the process. I, for one, am partial to dry presentations of RPG rules. I don't need to get excited by good writing. But I do have to "get" what's going on with the rules to be interested by them. I have to understand their purpose. If I'm rolling to hit in D&amp;D, I get why I'm doing that. With your game, I have to just trust that if I start to play, and follow your rules, something cool is going to happen. That's very, very hard to get excited about.<br/>
<br/>
Mike<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I'm trying to recall from memory now, the problems that I had with it. That was a while ago.<br/>

                            Guy,<br><br>So, you've been working on this game like forever, and I'm still not even clear on what happens when you play it. Like, I understand that there's a lot of quirky psychological modeling involved. <i>And then...?</i> How does any of that lead us to a Guy Ritchie movie? Your whole description of what you can do with this game is vague, abstract, and unfocused to the point that it's not really saying  anything.<br><br>Putting your color commentary stuff in as footnotes is kinda annoying. It would read a lot better if you put that stuff right into the text, in parentheses or even square [editorial voice] brackets. It might be really fun if you took a cue from Burning Wheel and had the comments visually barge into the text as the voices of Rat, Dirt, and Water.<br><br>Also,
<blockquote><br>Imagine some Flow-Charts here.<br/></br></blockquote>
ACK! That is very frustrating! I hope that's supposed to be placeholder text! At least you're being honest that the text alone is not doing an adequate job of communicated the game flow. I might be willing to generate some diagrams for you if I can figure out how the game flow actually goes.<br><br>Also, I have this sense there are elements of the design that were unnecessarily emphasized to hit the ingredients of the Ronnies challenge, and the Ronnies are over, and you're still trying to prove to someone that you <i>are so</i> using the ingredients. But no one cares if you're using the ingredients correctly anymore, we'd just like to see a fun, playable game. Perhaps Rat, Dirt, and Water could be more anthropic? They seem pretty alien and hard to relate to as they are. I don't actually see how these are particularly strong as Jungian archetypes. It seems very forced and contrived. Put another way: Why are you using these particular three entities, when you could just as easily call them Zeus, Hermes, and Athena (or such), that might already resonate with the reader? Speaking of which, why must there be exactly three? Couldn't you use two or five to accommodate different group sizes?<br><br>Has anyone actually played this game?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Larry, thanks for your input.<br><br>Some answers!<br><br>First, this game was playtested several times, online, using IRC. The playtest reports (and links to the logs) are on the Forge: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20127.0" rel="nofollow">first playtest</a> and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20344.0" rel="nofollow">second playtest</a>.<br><br>Seems some Polish folk tried to pbp on a Polish forum, till the game runner was banned. I tried to contact him to no avail, not surprisingly they didn't even finish the first scene. The game is high on bidding and direct player-to-player interaction and discussion. Chat was too slow for it, so you can imagine how pbp goes.<br><br>The Guy Ritchie influence is definitely there, but it's definitely not represented in the rules. I am referring to cutting Cranium Rats into Cranium and Rats <a href="http://gamecraft.7.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=244" rel="nofollow">here</a>, on GameCraft. Rats will be the Pulp Fiction game, and Cranium will be most of what is there now, controlling a person and navigation through a metaphysical battle.<br><br>Three is a number where there's opposition. There's one, there's two, and the third can either side with one of them or start his own side. I didn't want an even number, and 5 is too much, IMO. Four is a good solid number, which is why the Enlightened is there. Cranium will probably have an option to do away with the Enlightened, keeping only 3 players. I'll also add rules about 3+ players (the rules support it right now, but for each character only 4 players apply, which can be problematic).<br><br>The Rat, Dirt and Water, the names may have to go, but they tie into the Legends. The purpose of the Legends is to paint a map of the metaphysical world, especially the relationships between the Aspects, the Enlightened and reality. The biblical stuff is there because it ties down to our core. At least for those of you who've studied the Old Testament for 11 years, heh..<br><br>I'm thinking of finding other names. I'm feeling like I'm presenting a Rorchach image, I'm using broad-strokes, and in the setting up of the game the group is called to describe what each Aspect covers exactly.<br>Deities feel too well defined for me, but seeing Emily Care's new game on GC lead to some more thought on the venue ( she used Rose, Hidden, Shorn, Thorn, Sword, etc.).<br>I feel like it's a problem, trying to both define and leave it undefined, vague.<br><br>The Flow-Charts are definitely a place-holder. But my skills with graphics, even of the most basic kind suck, suck hard. So I let it stay there.<br>As for game-flow, I think those sections are clear ones. It's almost a bullet-point, go from one to two, etc. and then repeat. Create a scene, conflict turn, round, and again, each time going up and bigger, like how each section in Burning Empires is comprised of several smaller divisions.<br/>(The Flow of the Game section is what I'm referring to. It was originally in bullet points/numbers, and to raise clarity I turned it into actual sentences and paragraphs)<br/><br/>I guess when I finally create an alpha for Rats, and a new Beta for Cranium, I'll also try to do those charts. For Cranium, Rats will be very much a violence/story game. Story will be there mechanically.<br/><br/>This reminds me, also need to try the "Write rules by Bullet Point", as a starting point!<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
