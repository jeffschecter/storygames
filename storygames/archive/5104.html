We avoided the tables set up in a horseshoe for formal meetings, and chose the sofa group in the corner, centered around a low table. Putting down the papers, I looked around the circle. <br/><br/>To my right was Tomas. He'd suddenly called me to say he wanted to play with us. He'd read a post about <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/archipelago/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a> on the Norwegian forum and thought it looked nice. It should - as with most things I do, it's inspired by things he's done before. However, Tomas isn't always the easiest person to cooperate with.<br/><br/>To my left, Ole Peder. The creative player, an alpha player with a heart. He can always come up with a fitting character or situation - effortlessly and to the point. But when he's in a silly mood, the game can suffer - and other players can feel overshadowed when he takes the spotlight, even when he tries to share it.<br/><br/>Directly to my right, H\xe5ken. An inscrutable guy - artistic, funny, but also critical and pessimistic. He designs the most hilarious things you ever want to play. But when it's supposed to get serious, something seems to stop - things are never good enough.<br/><br/>And opposite me, Magnus. Always a good player, always ready to connect the characters, bringing coherence to the story. Annoyingly good-natured at all times.<br/><br/>All five of us design games. And now we were going to play mine.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115401/#Comment_115401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T13:21:35+00:00" title="December 19, 2007  1:21PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Moving forward with approved content].<br/><br/>We passed through the living room; as cosy as it is, there's far too much smoke and cathair for my tastes, and the close quarters of the dining room facilitate a far more intimate dining experience.<br/><br/>Across from me, Ram. A bona fide hippie capitalist, the median American in every sense. His games are descriptive, florid, and yet somehow always involve the dice ruling the world. He characterizes mechanics as "another player who speaks in a very dry tone of voice, but whose input is always interesting."<br/><br/>Maybe I'm a control freak, or maybe I just prefer Karma to Fate. I shrug and sit down; it'll be fun enough either way.<br/><br/>To my left, Jenny, Ram's longtime partner and the personification of casual gamer. She'll happily tell Ram, "wow, that's totally roleplaying wrong." My fiancee, Laurelin, often wonders why people "play with toys" like dice and tokens when they're RP'ing; I think her and Jenny would get along in that respect.<br/><br/>To my right, Alex, a fellow philosopher/theologan/transcendalist. His vocal outside-the-box input, combined with a transcendental outlook on life, was a perfect foil to my transhumanist existentialism.<br/><br/>Others have come and gone. Most bring sets of dice, Player's Handbooks, artifacts of their preconceived notions. When an hour goes by without a combat or a die roll, some have thrown up their hands in disgust. Others have looked disappointed that not enough Awesome was brought. Still others have gotten into a story and really made something powerful that they simply can't control, yet can't let go of.<br/><br/>We all design games, but none of us design the same kinds or with the same intentions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
