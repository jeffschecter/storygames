I thought every printed book had to have a 10 or 13 digit ISBN number to identify it with but recently searching for AGON's isbn has not been fruitful. <br/><br/>The Question: <br/><br/>Does it have an ISBN? If so where. <br/><br/>ITT: The answer, and general chatter about Bookmooch, or other related conversation<br/><br/>GO!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206599/#Comment_206599" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T17:22:43+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  5:22PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most American or British indie games don't have ISBNs. They're not legally mandated in most countries, just a de facto standard. They're probably not very popular simply because people don't use distribution venues that would care, and ISBNs cost money in the USA (and Britain, as I understand it). To compare, it's pretty trivial for me to get and use an ISBN for my publications, as the numbers are free in Finland - and practically necessary for library and bookstore sales in-country. Thus something like <i>Solar System</i> has an ISBN, it's... 978-952-99414-5-2. I'd be surprised if anybody wanted to sell or trade it at Bookmooch, though.<br/><br/>Also, games that are not books or their electrical equivalents do not get ISBNs. For example, my <i>Zombie Cinema</i> does not have it. I got the next best thing at the time, which was the three-letter producer identity code that American game retail apparently uses to keep track of product. I don't know much about that system, though, and at a glance my impression is that American indie designers don't use that system, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206618/#Comment_206618" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-10T21:54:09+00:00" title="May 10, 2009  9:54PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ISBNs are expensive in the US.  They're somewhere between $40-100 each, though you can get them cheaper if you order a bunch.  For a while, IPR was purchasing them in groups of 10 and then re-selling them at a smaller cost to member publishers, but it meant that your products were dual-listed as IPR and your own company or something like that.  I also have no idea if IPR is still providing that service.  Game stores like ISBNs, because it makes it easier for them to track sales, so you'll notice that some indie games do have them (on my shelf, I see SOTC, Cold City, Little Fears, Mouse Guard) but most don't.  A large percentage of indie games sales in the US are direct to customers, so it's not critical to have one in many cases.  Burning Empires, I notice, doesn't even have one and Luke moves a lot of books.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206627/#Comment_206627" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T00:42:17+00:00" title="May 11, 2009 12:42AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2009 12:43AM by renatoram.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            40-100$ each is fucking expensive! <br/><br/>In Italy you have to buy them in batches.
