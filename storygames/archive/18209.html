Figuring out the right rate is one of the big question's I've got right now, and you're right that it might be to steep an increase now. I don't think it should be linear since there should be some increase in what PCs are able to accomplish between rests, but you may be right that the current increase is to drastic. I'm planning to experiment with something in between.<br/><br/>The other question is if the experience system does what it's supposed to do, which is put pressure on the PCs to push ahead with adventures and finish them without refreshing. <br/><br/>I've also had some playtesters suggest possible variants, such as counting dice you defeat and doing some math with that.\n<blockquote>Apart from being simple and approachable, I'd say you could use more content to get more players interested.

There are plans to make more content like magic items and such, but I wanted get the beta-test version out for people to start looking at, so that will come later. <br/><br/>Did you get a chance to look at the sample adventure at the end of the document? Is that the kind of thing that you are looking for or something else? Maybe a couple paragraphs about the fantasy setting?<br/><br/>I'll admit that names may not be my strong suit. I've called it abstract because the relationship between the rules and the fiction is an abstraction. Spending a die of Toughness can mean lots of different things. I included dungeon because to a lot of RPG player's its short hand for the kind of D&amp;D genre of fantasy that the game assumes. I recognize that it might not be clear to new players though, or those who avoid that genre. I thought about Abstract Fantasy, but that doesn't have the same ring to it. I'm open to hearing suggestions for other names too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411240/#Comment_411240" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-03T17:49:38+00:00" title="April  3, 2013  5:49PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the reason the XP system works in D&amp;D is that different tiers of levels have pretty dramatically different scales of action. Like an adventure for levels 5-7 will annihilate a group with PCs of only levels 1-3, and an adventure for level 15-17 will do the same for those level 5-7 characters. It also means that if one character is of significantly lower level, they will catch up much quicker, while one character with a much higher level than the others won't advance at all if they stick to adventures suitable for their lower-level comrades.<br/><br/>You've already got something like this with the refresh thing. Like, if one person has way more dice than the others, the refresh that lowers the overall XP comes quicker, so bringing lower-level characters on a more difficult adventure lowers the XP haul. However, this also means that higher-level characters can actually do better with lower-level adventures because they will never have to refresh, and once that problem is dispensed with, it's just a matter of getting through X number of dice. Does that make sense? The refresh rate penalizes characters who take on too much opposition, but actually works to the benefit of characters tackling easy adventures.<br/><br/>I ended up scrapping my original version, which had PCs "completing quests" in place of your XP, but otherwise the numbers were pretty similar. I then had the problem of defining a "quest" which you've solved, but at the same time, who wants to go through 15 adventures without a single advance? Basic D&amp;D says about 4 adventures/modules of appropriate difficulty should get a character to the next level.<br/><br/>So what I did was change it so that you only needed 3 quests to advance a level, but each quest had to have a number of elements to it equal to your current level to count. So "explore dungeon level one" or "recover the stolen treasure" would each count towards getting you to level 2, but if you were level 4, you needed a quest like "infiltrate the dread lord's castle, ruin his arcane laboratory, rescue the princess, and cure her magical disease" to count towards the 3 you needed for level 5.<br/><br/>Those are entirely based on the fiction, though, not on the mechanical strength of the opposition or anything. But you could do something similar, where PCs of X level require an adventure with X level of difficulty or they get no XP. You'd have to figure out what that level of difficulty means, though. It could be total number of dice you need to defeat before getting any XP, which would affect the decision of whether to rest and refresh or not. It looks like this is what you have going right now yeah?<br/><br/>Bit it could also be the number of dice attached to each challenge or obstacle. Like if an adventure has 60 dice, it's worth 10 XP, but it would be much easier to defeat if it's 30 challenges worth only 2 dice than if it's six challenges worth 10 dice each. Right? (I read the rules enough to get the resolution and XP stuff but barely skimmed the damage section, so I might have misunderstood something.) You could try having challenges and obstacles with less dice than the PC's level not count towards XP they get at the end of an adventure, along with a much smaller increase of required XP between levels, although you would probably still need some increase. You might still get high-level PCs shepherding low-level PCs through adventures where they get nothing, just to get the low-level PCs up to a point where they can handle high-level adventures without always requiring a refresh and lowering the overall XP haul at the end, but they would basically lose all mechanical/rules-based incentive to take on low-level adventures and would instead go for the difficult ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatthewJHanson" title="MatthewJHanson"><img alt="MatthewJHanson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatthewJHanson">MatthewJHanson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411336/#Comment_411336" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-04T20:10:44+00:00" title="April  4, 2013  8:10PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay thanks, I get what you're saying.<br/><br/>RIght now the way it should work is that tougher adventures are worth more XP. I touch on this a little in the GM guidelines, but I'm not sure that's the most clearly written so I'll probably work on explaining that a little better. So PCs start out being able to do about a two XP adventure with no refreshes, and a few levels later they can do a three XP adventure with no refreshes. At that point they'd probably go with the three XP adventure. (That's assuming they have a choice, it might be that they have to do whatever's in front of them).<br/><br/>You are correct about how fewer challenges with large numbers of dice are more taxing than lots of challenges with smaller numbers, so I might look into that too.<br/><br/>The system also ends up working different than many with level imbalances. Low level character's don't get completely overwhelmed as the do in many games, the just have to rely on the higher-level PCs a little more to take on the challenges. It ends up having the net effect of character pretty close to the average PC level (So a fifth and and first level PC are pretty close their capabilities to two third-level PCs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
