But...<br/><br/>Just to get clear here, we're talking about the kind of resolution where two or more sides eventually decide on where they'd like the story to go from here, and then mechanics decide which of the two or more stories is the one that actually happens, right?<br/><br/>In PTA specifically, I dislike this because it reduces the impact of the high card player's narration. By the text, the highh card player gets to put the final stamp on what actually happens, constrained only by having to award the stakes as decided by the cards. But if the stakes included everything down to the minute detail, then that player has nothing to do.<br/><br/>In the more general case, I dislike this kind of prenegotiation because game mechanics, I feel, should be more than a way to arbitrate disagreements between players about which direction the fiction should go in. I like game mechanics to take us to places which neither side wanted (or more properly, to places that neither side had yet imagined).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173451/#Comment_173451" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T06:32:03+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  6:32AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 6:34AM by komradebob.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SadBunnyDrama:<br/>Can you give me an AP (or <i>quickly made-up but really close  to real</i>) example of what your outcomes sound like prior to engaging the card system?*<br/><br/>It sounds like something I've done as well, but the previous thread discussion makes me wonder if I'm talking about the same thing.<br/><br/><br/>*I know you've been talking specifically about PTA.

But I remember that I and at least one other player (Pedyo on this board) thought that was the correct way to do it, ie. to pre-negotiate outcomes of conflicts, and that that was what stakes meant.

In our games, the stakes were generally establishing the on-screen action (not only the physical action, that is, but also changes in relationships, convictions and the like), in a somewhat detailed manner, while the narrator had another important task, establishing the depth. Adding color to the dry outcome negotiated with distance to the fiction, he was adding the aesthetic, symbolic, and referential layer. As in "and the tear falls to the ground just like in that scene three episodes back" or "and now, Nicolas Cage is making this sort of Nicolas Cage's face". (Now, all that was usually open for suggestions from other players in our games, and the suggestions often generated Fanmail, but the narration winner was still in charge od what to incorporate.)</blockquote>\nYes, the high card narrator in the pre-negotiated version of PTA still gets to add a lot of colour (or at  least, act as gatekeeper to what colour gets through and what doesn't). But my feeling is that being colourist-in-chief is still a bit weak sauce as a role.<br/><br/>Let me ask you a question: why do you prefer not allowing the high card narrator much ability to state what happens beyond details of colour? <br/><br/>I'll also join the call for AP examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173506/#Comment_173506" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T10:33:30+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 10:33AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip, brilliant, that actual play example especially so.<br/><br/>Here's what makes me feel that (for me personally) the non-pre-negotiate way is the best way to do PTA: in your example, a lot of options are cut off:<br/><br/>* Yoko definitely dies.<br/>* Yoko definitely confesses everything before she dies.<br/>* Sojuro may or may not survive, but there's no chance of him dying right now.

It was more about conclusion and final statement about Sojuro's issue. Somehow finishing character's issue outside player's decision felt wrong in this case.

Indeed, pre-negotiation is attractive precisely because it avoids unpleasant outcomes - my concern is that in so doing it also avoids potentially awesome outcomes.<br><br>I can tell you about times where pre-negotiating a scene prevented it from going anywhere interesting, although they wouldn't be desperately interesting play examples - "we knew what was going to happen, so we just skipped over it and moved on" would summarise most of them. I could also tell you about times where mechanics forced players into story events that nobody was actually suggesting at the time.\n<blockquote><br/>Also, isn't part of the point of negotiating any stakes to get to what folks are comfortable with? <br/></blockquote>\nNo, I don't believe so. I think that, in PTA at least, stakes are simply what the protagonist(s) in the scene wants most out of the scene (and one should be careful about generalising "stakes" across games, as I think the term is used differently in different games). Indeed, I don't think that in PTA (the way I play it) the stakes themselves ought to be "negotiated" much if at all. Indeed, reading the short section on stakes setting in the PTA rules I have here reveals that the text does not suggest that stakes be negotiated, but merely that each protagonist's player should simply state what their protagonist's stakes are.<br/><br/>It's enough for each player to say what their character wants to get, and then let the cards tell them if they get it. The purpose of stakes in PTA (as I play it) is not to ensure that all players are happy with all potential story outcomes, but to ensure that all protagonists have their desires represented.<br/><br/>Another point: I'm not advocating as such that people should leave open options that none of them actually want to see. there's a distinction between "an outcome nobody had pre-narrated" and "an outcome nobody wants", or even "an outcome everyone actively dislikes".                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173555/#Comment_173555" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T12:29:59+00:00" title="October  6, 2008 12:29PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2008 12:32PM by komradebob.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite><br/>Thomas, do you have any actual play accounts where pre-negotiation made the game suck for you?<br/></blockquote>\nNot as such, no, as I try not to pre-negotiate or to allow too much pre-negotiation, and as stated above, pre-negotiation tends to be problematic more because of what<i>could have happened that would have been awesome but didn't</i>rather than<i>what did happen and sucked</i>.

Indeed, pre-negotiation is attractive precisely because it avoids unpleasant outcomes - my concern is that in so doing it also avoids potentially awesome outcomes.</blockquote>\nOn this note, I have an Actual Play, non-theoretical anecdote to share about where prenegotiation failed in a BE game.<br/><br/>I'm the GM. The player is D, who has never played a Burning-anything game (and, since this event took place, has become my most diehard Burning-anything hater). The situation, IIRC, is that he wants to make a vital Observation roll so the humans can get aligned for a strong Assess action. His character is shadowing a suspected bad guy deep into enemy territory. For a variety of reasons, I set the Ob to 4 -- tough roll, far from impossible since he'll be adding in all kinds of bonus dice and help and stuff. But still, math-wise, it's like a 50-50 chance of outright success.<br/><br/>After much discussion of intent-before-rolling, we drill down to what he's going for: If I succeed, I'll spot the NPC meeting with known Vaylen and catch it on film. And then I explain the consequences of failure: "If you fail, Vaylen guards will spot you."<br/><br/>Simple enough, right? I mean, it's a million miles away from a serious GM screwjob. It's not "If you fail, you'll be captured" or anything nasty. <br/><br/>But D doesn't like what he's hearing. Getting spotted means they'll give chase. He's terrible at making the getaway and he knows he stands a good chance at getting nabbed. Me saying "you get spotted" is, in his mind, just as good as "you'll be captured."<br/><br/>So he backs down his intent. "Okay, fine, I don't catch them on film. But I get an address for where they meet so we can come back later."<br/><br/>I don't change my intent, because to my mind it's a totally suitable complication.<br/><br/>D's having none of it. "What the fuck? Come on, man. You're saying I have a better-than-even chance of getting grabbed here."<br/><br/>Me: "So what? So you're spotted and most likely captured. Do you think I'm going to put a bullet in your character's head?"<br/><br/>Him: "I would. I would totally kill an NPC in the same situation."<br/><br/>Me: "..."<br/><br/>Him: "I feel like I've backed down my intent, here. It's gonna cost us more rolls to come investigate and that'll eat into our scenes."<br/><br/>Me: "Okay. Fine. So on a failure, you lose sight of your mark."<br/><br/>Him: "What? Then I've just totally wasted one of my three rolls? Okay...my intent is to follow them to the right street so at least we have someplace to start."<br/><br/>Me: "For fuck's sake. Okay. On a failure, you're spotted by non-Vaylen civilians on the street who might report your presence, if my Figure of Note thinks to ask around."<br/><br/>So that was an exercise in suck. What started as "Get photographic evidence or engage in an exciting chase across city rooftops!" becomes "Get the name of the street or get spotted by some kids." All because D had no appetite for risk. In a non-prenegotiated system, I'd have just sprung the "oh shit! You're spotted!" result and we'd have been back in high-action territory. But prenegotiating, for this kind of player, really is the "death of fun" (his words, direct quote).<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173638/#Comment_173638" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T16:35:17+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  4:35PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So that was an exercise in suck.

And I mean _everyone_ at the table, and hell, even interested passerbys.<br/><br/>To me, that's part of the negotiating: I mean which do you want? Cool Outcome <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> or Cool Outcome <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> ( <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>...)?<br/><br/>I honestly believe, that with a bit of pre-negotiation, you start hitting more enjoyable group event/story building. You stop being limited to just your character ( even though you may concentrate on one you like a bunch) and you stop being worried about particpation in the game, with or without a character.<br/><br/>Having made a Burning Wheel character, I'm actually afraid to get him killed off. Not because I love him ( I kinda like him), but because I have no interest in going through the process again any time soon. It sure as hell ain't like rolling up a B/X character and developing him in play ( assuming he survives).<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>One thing may make this different for me is that I came at S-Gs by way of more Everybody is GMish type games like Universalis and Engle Matrix Games, rather from a GM + Players perspective.

So, question: do you find that this doesn't happen when you're discussing the narration <i>after</i> the roll, or why is that not preferable? I don't think the intent of the PTA narration duties is any type of conch-shell style "everyone shuts up and the narrator talks" kind of thing... in my games, the post-narration is very alive with talking and shaping the details collaboratively, with the person who won narration duties having final veto or say and putting it all together. That's the area where undesirable outcomes get filtered... <br/><br/>Player 1 (with narration): "Sweet! So, Roxy continues to impress her friends! Next lunch break, she stages a very daring streak through the middle of the park!"<br/><br/>Roxy's Player: "Um, yeah, probably not something so extreme. She's not *that* wild."<br/><br/>Producer: "It should be something pretty outrageous, though."<br/><br/>Roxy's Player: "How about a partial striptease for the hottest guy in school, during that lunch break?"<br/><br/>Player 1: "Done and done. She stops just short of indecent exposure."<br/><br/>Roxy's Player: "Yes. Gotta keep some things a mystery, you know."<br/><br/>Producer: "And this show is on the WB, geez people."<br/><br/>Right?

The first is a creative pivot point.  That is we have Yay or Nay on the Stakes and when Stakes are limited to the "goals and intentions behind a character in action" then negotiations are limited to "the immediate consequences of that action and either it's achievement of loss of its intended purpose" which narrows down the range of fictional options more significantly than I think people give it credit for.<br/><br/>And<br/><br/>We have an "editor-in-chief" elected for the negotiations.  In Primetime Adventures that's The High Card, in a lot of game's it's the GM.  So while negotiations can happen and are ENCOURAGED to happen they still have a definitive cut off point -- when High Card says stop, they stop.  Period.  What High Card accepts or rejects is High Cards decision and his decision alone.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173746/#Comment_173746" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T06:00:45+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  6:00AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be clear, and I'm pretty sure you know this already Bob, but I'm personally a big fan of prenegotiation. But IME, it definitely requires all the players be on the same page as to what counts as "interesting." Because otherwise, the "if you fail" exercise becomes not only meaningless, but a specific point of friction.<br/><br/>In D's case above, what is "interesting" to him is him maximizing his success and minimizing his failure. The reason he's at the table is to beat the GM's challenge. So it's a conflict of interest for him to allow me to impose complications on his character's life in the event of a failure -- there is literally <i>no reason at all</i> for him to do so. In BW/BE you can sort of sweeten the pot by being very, very clever about offering up complications that might generate Artha, but only if he's invested in accepting the bribe. That, to my mind, is pretty advanced play.<br/><br/>I do believe prenegotiation has a role at the table even with some tactical/gamist players, as long as there's good sportsmanship and a sense of fair play at work. It certainly highlights the players for whom those are not prized gaming values.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_173753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173753/#Comment_173753" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T06:20:55+00:00" title="October  7, 2008  6:20AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2008 6:21AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with you on this, Filip, there is no reason pre-negotiated resolutions should be badwrong.

I would totally kill an NPC in the same situation."<br/><br/>Me: "..."</blockquote>\nThis report fascinated me because there's so much clash of assumption line by line it gave me whiplash. I can see, by the end of the conversation, where his expectation at being screwed over when failing creates such a reactionary response. What gets me is, what kind of result did he expect in the first place? He attempted something risky that his character isn't that great at, then was miffed to think that he might get caught or killed? That's just bizarre. Possibly the most extreme example of play-it-safe turtling I've ever seen.<br/><br/>But in any case, this example highlights the importance of making failure fun and interesting, so that there's no result that's just plain suck or dead-end. When you don't have to fear failure as a game-breaker or adventure-killer, you can play more boldly and have more fun in general.<br/><br/>My touchstone for this is Heroquest, where "dead" isn't a die result, period. "Dying" is, but you can always get rescued or healed in an appropriately dramatic manner. Thus death is a result of the players agreeing that yep, it's time for this guy to die, and if it's not that time, then failing is great! You can be beaten, captured, tortured, humiliated. . .or any number of adverse results that enrich the story instead of sucking the life from it.<br/><br/>And no, HQ doesn't have "stakes," but games that do often have the same emergent feature. I'm awfully fond of Stakes in Shadow of Yesterday; very simple and direct; on each roll you've got one good thing to happen and one bad thing. The good thing cements what the character is trying to accomplish and provides a concrete metric for whether he succeeds. The bad thing ensures that the story moves forward whichever way the dice toss, and introduces fun complications. It's a robust alternative to "succeed and you accomplish your task, fail and nothing happens" type situations.<br/><br/><b>Example:</b><i> I was GMing TSoY, and my friend's Mathew's PC was trapped in the library of a burning building, having just found a rare scroll of prized information. He attempted to bash his way through the wall as the flames closed in. I set the losing stakes as, "the scroll catches fire." He failed. So the scroll caught fire, not completely burned, but <i>part</i> of the information lost. Thus his quest would continue, but complicated by incomplete lore. In a different system, the scene could well have fallen flat, with a failed roll either just plain killing him, or just meaning he had to roll again (and again, and again) until he made it. This way, failure cost him something, without simply bumping him off.</i><br/><br/>Now, there was no negotiation. There could have been, like in Paul and D's case, over whether I was asking too much, and either of us could have amended our statements (in fact, Matthew was aghast at the thought of losing the scroll but only mentioned this after the roll. I, however, never had any intention of destroying the scroll; that'd be a lame and uninteresting screwjob). But in the absence of any objections, negotiation was unneeded.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is, I realized as I was reading these threads that negotiation happens in nearly <i>all</i> games t some extent. most of the time, you'll just be announcing actions and resolving them, but every so often you come up against a "wait, if I'd a' known that I would have done <i>this</i> instead" situation, or a "hmm, guys, what'd be the best way to resolve this?" question. And then people furrow their brows, consult rules, bandy options, arrive at a decision, and move on. it's not game-breaking; it's fine. In fact, TSoY addresses this specifically in the rules (hell, so does Sorcerer). It's just that negotiation is there as needed, not assumed to be the default process, and it's certainly not the same as actually playing the scene. The scene is in fact "on pause" while you hammer it out, then resumes. Which is why you can get some good negotiation without pre-playing if you stick to negotiating specific actions of immediate intent.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174010/#Comment_174010" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-07T22:53:32+00:00" title="October  7, 2008 10:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Filip,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sadbunnydrama</cite>In the other thread someone suggested that in the above AP example nothing important was resolved by the roll.<br/><br/>To clarify: that was certainly not the case. The scene occurred in the context of the whole show. At this point leaving the death of Yoko to chance wasn't interesting, and the same goes for her confession. What we actually determined by the roll, and it was very clear for everyone (as in, people were commenting about it) were the consequences of Sojuro's actions. He could have paid for what he did with (implicit) defeat, but he asserted his right to do so with force, leaving the site confidently. In the context of that session, it felt like a powerful enough a difference.<br/></blockquote>\nThat wasn't "someone." That was me.<br/><br/>And I wasn't saying "nothing important" was resolved. I just said that some of your decisions of what to leave out left me cold. And I included the caveat that I wasn't there and don't know the larger context. It just looks lame to me to auto-kill a major rivalrous NPC. Maybe it wasn't. Maybe Yoko was a little weasel bitch that just needed to die. Just saying what it looks like from the outside. Other elements look fine to me. Taking the confession as given, absolutely. The whole point of the scene is the confession, rolling to withhold it is just a dead end. And Sojuro dying, I completely understand leaving that off the table. But negotiating consequences down to Sojuro getting vaguely roughed up or something. . .seems dull to me. Was Yoko that weak a force in the story, that she's just there to confess the sinister truth, and die? If the character has an ounce of evil manipulator panache, I can see all kinds of possible outcomes, such as breaking Sojuro's spirit, turning his wrath against another target, convincing him that he needs here help in some odious way, and so on. That's what I'm talking about. It looks like you removed all possible consequences from the table save "Sojuro gets beat up some," and handed him all his (fictional) goals on a platter.<br/><br/>Eh. It doesn't jazz me. You don't have to go on defending it, and I'm pretty much done critiquing it. You have me at a disadvantage since I wasn't there and didn't partake of the creative and emotional energy of the moment. So you could probably go on explaining away any criticisms I might have indefinitely.

And yes, especially playing Sorcerer clashes with those big time a few minutes into prep. I've tried it more than once, even with people who up front solemnly declared that they were OK with the game's implications after describing it to them. Most of them probably have other social problems as well, but to be honest I'm not bothered any more - I think it's a waste of time.<br/><br/>Can I just ask: when you say "face-stabby IAWA", do you by that mean without pre-negotiated outcomes of conflicts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174093/#Comment_174093" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T09:34:51+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  9:34AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Melinglor:<br/>Having read your response to Paul B, I'm thoroughly confused as to where ( if anyplace) I'm actually at odds with you over stakes-setting techniques?!?<br/><br/>I may actually be more confused than ever, actually.<br/><br/>To me, your example looks like<i> Outcomes that are interesting, no matter which way it goes</i>, so I'm at a loss to see how that's different from what I'm advocating.

History Lesson.  Again.<br/><br/>This is my summary of Conflict Resolution as originally conceptualized by Ron Edwards on The Forge.<br/><br/>"Let us step back and re-examine Conflict Resolution vs. Task Resolution. The key concept in Conflict Resolution is that it resolves the conflict of interest between two [in fiction] pro-active and motivated forces. I swing a tire iron at your head while you try to sweep kick me. That\u2019s a conflict. Just because the rules resolve these individual actions doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suddenly Task Resolution.<br/><br/>The difference between Task and Conflict is whether or not there exists [in fiction] an opposing pro-active, motivated and intentioned force. That\u2019s why resolving climbing a fence is TASK resolution because the fence is not out to purposefully stop me, especially in light of the person whom I trying to catch fleeing on the other side. This concept is sometimes muddled by the fact that there are times when an inanimate object can be considered to be acting with motivated and intentioned force and there are times when a living agent is really just the weapon or color being used by the real pro-active, motivated and intentioned force."<br/><br/>BOTH Task and Conflict Resolution as originally hashed out strictly concern the in-fiction actions of the in-fiction characters.<br/><br/>Mechanics which parcel out PLAYER desires about things are NEITHER Task NOR Conflict Resolution.  They're mechanics with parcel out PLAYER desires about things.  They *resolve* nothing in terms of the fiction.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174194/#Comment_174194" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T16:00:10+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  4:00PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 4:04PM by komradebob.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Things have apparently moved beyond that, wouldn't you say?<br/><br/>Evolution is funny that way.<br/><br/>I'm sure that any number of discussions, both at TF and elsewhere, about the fact that fictional stuff has no motivation outside of that handed down by real, living, actual people may have had something to do with that. <br/><br/>And, if that is true, why not go directly to the source, the person playing, and avoid fictions about the fictional content?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174197/#Comment_174197" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T16:08:28+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  4:08PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Things have apparently moved beyond that, wouldn't you say?<br/></blockquote>\nAll of academia would collapse if people kept willy-nilly redefining terms.

That's the whole POINT to creating terms, as short hands for specific things. If you keep shifting the definition then you're no longer referring to the specific thing, you're referring to some OTHER specific thing.<br/><br/>Uh... So if we're going to redefine Conflict Resolution to mean resolving player desires, then pray tell what do we call mechanics that resolve clashes of intention between in-fiction characters, so that I may use THAT term to refer to THAT specific thing and have to stop repeating myself about Conflict Resolution.<br/><br/>I don't care what terms we use so long as we distinguish between the two things!<br/><br/><br/>Honestly, I've been an adbocate of using <b>Outcome Resolution</b> or <b>Player Level Resolution </b>when I first encountered people having issues with this use of ConRes.<br/><br/>I'm fine with using a different term, but when I suggested sometyhing like that before, the culture around here was down on expanding/creating jargon, so it was a no-go.<br/><br/>Also, academia will NOT collapse, willy-nilliness be damned.<br/><br/>Unless, y'know, that's the outcome you're negotiating towards. :-P                        </div>\n<div

Negotiation if we consider Outcome to be Yay or Nay on Intention.<br/><br/>Because the FULL resolution of an in-fiction action involve the character taking action, the intention behind the action, and the consequences for succeeding or failing in that intention.  The part I'm against is pre-negotiating those consequences.<br/><br/>And then there's the whole issue of Content Authority beyond an at-hand fictional conflict.  For example, someone saying, "It's raining" and a player being able to spend a resource or roll a die or whatever to say, "No, it's not" or "It's snowing instead."  Universalis for example uses Tokens for this kind of thing.  I'm not *fond* of those mechanics because I think they distract from the fictions momentum.  I much prefer investing someone with that authority like a GM or Round-Robin (like Spione or Dirty Secrets) for that kind of thing.  <br/><br/>I think people tend to muddle those two things such that pre-negotiation tends to mix those two things into a frustrating mess.<br/><br/>Does that break down at least help?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174202/#Comment_174202" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T16:26:33+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  4:26PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2008 4:29PM by komradebob.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe.

I know in theory that is supposedly not an issue, yet inevitably in conversation, it does indeed seem to be a point of contention.<br/><br/>For example, I like a choice between ( a pair, a trio) of relatively "Lumpy" outcomes that cover a fair bit of ground on almost all occasions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174203/#Comment_174203" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T16:27:48+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  4:27PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert,<br/><br/>Well, it seems you can't escape history, 'cuz I invoked Sorcerer in this context and didn't breathe a word about Conflict Resolution, and here you are haranguing folks about CR vs TR.<br/><br/>So, to answer your questions:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Having read your response to Paul B, I'm thoroughly confused as to where ( if anyplace) I'm actually at odds with you over stakes-setting techniques?!?</blockquote>\nWell. . .I don't think we're at odds all that much as it turns out. What I've been mainly saying in the other thread, as our veiws emerge and O compare them, is that what you're saying seems to fall well within the paradigm I'm describing, and you seem to <i>think</i> that they're at odds. The biggest example of this is your assumption that putting individual intents at the fore is contrary to "playing the world" as a GM. It's not. Perhaps the confusion stems from a gut reaction to the word "individual"?<br/><br/>Also, as I said, while you call intents 'just another factor," I think they're the <i>most important</i> factor. A matter of emphasis, perhaps. or maybe more. Can you provide an example of a factor that is <i>equally or more important</i> than characters' intents in the shaping of a story/roleplaying game? 'Cuz I can't see it. All I can think of is shit like floods and erupting volcanoes, which can be a great overarching crisis situation, but would get pretty dull without individuals' intents interacting in the crisis.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>The solitary point of different I see is that I would clarify failure resuklt and give a person a second to ratchet up or down before the roll of the dice.</blockquote>\nActually (sorry to confuse once again) that's the biggest point where I think we <i>don't</i> differ. A moment to amend or switch intents is exactly what I'm calling for. it's <i>more</i> than that where I think it goes screwy; anything where you'd end up repeating a chunk of description after the roll. That's what I, and I think others, call pre-play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>As for a "Free and clear" discussion period, as per Sorceror IIRC, how is that different than negotiating stakes or what folks have been calling pre-narrated outcomes?</blockquote>\nBasically, you're negotiating intent, period, like Moreno says. You're getting straight what characters are trying to accomplish and an idea of the circumstances under which you're attempting them. So you're not hammering out the outcomes so much as taking care of shit like "Oh, I didn't know the fence was 20 feet high! Maybe I wouldn't try to jump it!" You're making sure nobody's getting screwed by misunderstandings, differing expectations at the immediate-detail level. But that's about it. You're not protecting against like, any unwanted outcome ever.<br/><br/>peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174204/#Comment_174204" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T16:33:31+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  4:33PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, this is where things get weird.<br/><br/>What if I want the character to fall on the rusty nails, get impaled and die and you want him to find a puppy and eat ice cream?<br/><br/>Frankly, I find your outcome really annoying.

I'm not concerned with protecting Alice (i.e. having her character run off and shoot and her husband without Alice's players consent).  I'm concerned about eliminating Bob from the decision making process.<br/><br/>If Bob's player goes, "I want to convince Alice that her husband is cheating on her."  I DON'T want Bob's player to have a say in what the consequences of that are.  I want him to have to live with and re-evaluate his character's outlook as they roll out from the game.  I want him to roll the dice and win and have Alice's player grin and say, "I go home and shoot my husband" and Bob's player face to drop to the floor with shock.  If Bob's player REALLY wants to say what Alice does he should have to shoot for the High Card in PtA and he's just out of luck in Sorcerer.<br/><br/>In other words I don't want Bob's player re-evaluating his character's chosen course of actions by knowing in advance what the consequences of his character's decisions are.<br/><br/>I KNEW there was a reason I asked you if you were familiar with "No One Gets Hurt" vs. "I Will Not Abandon You." because this conversation seemed related to those concepts and now I know why.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174211/#Comment_174211" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T16:54:12+00:00" title="October  8, 2008  4:54PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "anything where you'd end up repeating a chunk of description after the roll.

In fact, I don't see how it's avoidable with pre-negotiation that extends beyond immediate intent.<br/><br/>Let's say we're playing PTA (this is a fake example but maps exactly to my experience playing pre-negotiated PTA), and we, after conferring, work out Stakes like "my character Alex convinces your character Susan the real truth about her parents and she runs crying from the room to confide in her brother.." Then we draw. I win! Whoever's got the high card now has to narrate, "Uh, so Alex tells Susan the real truth about her parents [possible insertion of dialogue], and she, well, runs crying from the room. She then, er, confides in her brother."<br/><br/>Or just as often the Narrator feels foolish enough that they just say "So, all that stuff we said, it happens."<br/><br/>That's what I'm talking about. It's a pretty simple case, so repeat narration is minimal, but it easily balloons with more complex sets of "Stakes." And note that dialogue is often completely optional, at least it was when I played. Often the minor aesthetic benefit of speaking characters' lines isn't worth the hassle of hashing over the outcome's narration when it was already laid out in negotiation. And sure, some fun color gets added by the Narrator, but it's not that big an incentive (at least for me).<br/><br/>i tried it that way, it was unfun, and that's pretty much where I'm at with it.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174239/#Comment_174239" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-08T22:51:59+00:00" title="October  8, 2008 10:51PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, for all you negotiated outcome fans out there, I have a question.

Unless you've somehow misconstrued my example. I'm assuming all four protagonists are not only in the scene but also involved in the conflict, and that they all, consequently, by the rules as written, have set individual stakes.<br/><br/>PTA p.28: "For every conflict, each player with a protagonist involved must clarify exactly what the stakes are <i>for that protagonist</i>" (emphasis mine)<br/><br/>A play example follows in which we see two protagonists in a conflict each with their own stakes. The conflict wraps up with neither of them achieving their stakes, but there were three other possible outcomes: Meredith getting her stakes, Billy getting his, and BOTH of them getting their stakes. That's a total of four possible outcomes: two protags, two outcomes for each protag = 2^2 = 4.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_174326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174326/#Comment_174326" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T10:47:14+00:00" title="October  9, 2008 10:47AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>A quick, to the point question:<br/>For the folks who seem against ( due to taste or whatever) the idea of negotiate multiple outcomes-roll dice to pick type mechanics; What do you imagine it looks/sounds like in practice?<br/><br/>I mean, post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a> here really looks like a pretty much prime example of how ther process works in practice.</blockquote>\nI'm entirely happy to believe it looks exactly like Filip's example in post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a>.

There was the son and his twin sisters.  Pressure was on the son to take over the business from his dying father  but one of his sisters was the real mechanical genuis.  The other sister had gone into the clergy.  Also in the "show" was a rival family who experimented in this new science called electricity.  In the final episode of the last season the son challenged the rival family to technological duel, a device of their invention vs a device of his sister's invention.<br/><br/>At the duel the son's stakes were: Do I ruin the reputation of the rival family?  The genius sister's Stakes were: Does my machine win the duel?  The clergy sister's Stakes were: Can I show my Cardinal why my family is so important to me?  (She had kind of been shirking her duties to the church all season long to help her family).<br/><br/>The all play cards against the Producer.  So there were 12 of possible outcomes.<br/><br/>Win the duel? Yay or Nay<br/>Ruin the Rival Family Reputation? Yay or Nay<br/>Cardinal realizes the importance of the family? Yay or Nay<br/><br/>What ever combo comes up, it's up the High Card play to justify it.  For example, what if they win the duel but also succeed din ruining the rival family reputation?

Robert, tell me who said it was badwrongfun and I'll poke him in the eye.<br/><br/>What I'm interested in is this: why do pre-negotiating outcomes of fictional conflicts work against what I want if I play with a story now preference? I've had a hard time formulating it, I could only sense it was not right for me, in play. Some people have gone as far as saying that this drift of "stakes" is dysfunctional - I don't know, not sure I care, but I want to know why it screams NOOOOO! to me in my own play. For one, I know it's a damn easy way of playing to slide into - because it's safe.<br/><br/>I think Jesse pretty much nailed it on his Play Passionately blog, at least for me. It's about being author and audience at the same time, without neglegting one or the other. I hope it's OK to quote him here, the entire post is this: <a href="http://playpassionately.wordpress.com/2008/08/12/the-slippery-slope-of-stakes/" rel="nofollow">The Slippery Slope of Stakes</a>.<br/><br/>Jesse wrote: <i>"Most often what the trip down this slope is about is protecting the player\u2019s vision of how the story \u201cshould\u201d go. The simplest form this takes concerns pre-deciding whether the character should succeed or fail at the conflict at hand and then Stakes become about negotiating what the consequences of that are.<br/><br/>"Constantly coming to vigorous creative agreement about how the story \u201cshould\u201d go and always going for what the players *want* to have happen means the players never challenge themselves. They never let themselves be surprised (in the audience sense) and are never forced to re-evaluate where they want to go next (in the author sense)."</i><br/><br/>That explains it to me, and I think this is central to this discussion. Not how many possible outcomes you care to negotiate.

So, you lose that bit so essential to Story Now of finding out how things will resolve, of finding out the story you're building, what will come of the characters following their passions, because during the negotiation you end up agreeing to tell the story you already know is true. Which is my roundabout way of saying it's probably a technique that could really use a lot more exploration, but doesn't fit well with some people's play preferences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meserach" title="Meserach"><img alt="Meserach" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meserach">Meserach</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174379/#Comment_174379" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T14:40:42+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  2:40PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>Then, I see a few people insistently calling badwrongfun, coming up with absurd examples of why the thing couldn't possibly work ( in the face of evidence that in, fact it does, with real live people) and name-dropping game designer names.<br/></blockquote>\nThose people are not me, Robert. I denied even the existence of badwrongfun as my first post to this thread. I have stated that I do indeed think that the pre-negotiated method works - I merely feel that, while functional, it is not <i>as good</i> as my own interpretation. And citing a well-argued post by a designer is not name dropping - the purpose is not to say "Vincent believes it so I must be correct", the point is to say "hey, here's an argument explaining my opinion".<br/><br/>I believe that my way of playing PTA is better, yes, but that is not to say that the pre-negotiation approach sucks, is incorrect, wrong, illegal or any other such silliness. It is merely to say that I feel that the game plays better by my own interpretation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7829/x" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7829/x" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7829/x/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F7829%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F7829%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
