Now I'm not really sure what will happen.<br/><br/>A. The bailiff will say "That's stupid, because X" and punish the captain of the watch for being stupid, altering the power structure of the keep.<br/><br/>B. The bailiff will say "Ok, we'll do it", do it, and then the outcome will be Y.<br/><br/>Either of these two will have a lasting consequence on the keep, which is good because the players dumped a lot of drama points (Hillfolk on the borderlands???) on this (they were talking with the captain of the watch in the inn).

It wasn't really his problem, the consequences of failure could be disastrous, and he wasn't going to send his men into unscouted, eldritch territory. Plus it was winter, so not the best time for it.<br/><br/>This was not, of course, the same as not doing anything: the bailiff routinely organized scouting expeditions in an effort to gauge the strength of the enemy, using the relatively-competent PCs as the spear-head. He was attempting to get a sense for what was, to him, largely unknown: what are the local pagans (as he largely construed the situation) capable of, where their strength and reserves are situated, and so on. If the PCs had ever managed to bring him the facts he needed (mainly the idea that the trolls are killable, where they live, and a ball-park figure on their numbers), a general assault on them might have been in order.<br/><br/>As the trolls (the catch-all term for ugly fairy monsters in our Swedish campaign environment) were also doing strategic thinking, the situation ultimately developed into a sort of raid/counter-raid dynamic where the humans didn't want to commit to decisive action in the caves, and the trolls didn't have the strength to storm the keep's walls. The trolls were generally winning, though, thanks to wider strategic concerns: the king would probably call most of the keep's personnel to join him in Lithuania come summer, leaving a skeleton crew that the trolls could overcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475369/#Comment_475369" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-15T08:26:03+00:00" title="July 15, 2018  8:26AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is incredibly helpful, thank you Eero!

It was in the eastern reaches of medieval V\xe4stmanland. I wasn't working off the bestest demographic data, but my concept for the region was that the titular "borderland" was about the medieval colonization of eastern Svealand. The keep was probably built too much "forward" in terms of local population numbers, but that's clearly the case in the original scenario as well, and I justified it as a sort of a pro-active approach to taming a wilderness replete with trolls (which, I assume, were not present in real history).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475373/#Comment_475373" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-15T11:11:42+00:00" title="July 15, 2018 11:11AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the forces of chaos live around lake M\xe4laren?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475374/#Comment_475374" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-15T11:27:33+00:00" title="July 15, 2018 11:27AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2018 12:16PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, yes - I meant western end of V\xe4stmanland, of course, rather than east. About a hundred miles from Arboga by my hex map. (It's not marked <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qtna6w7innkbcfy/V%C3%A4stmanland.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but it'd be about mid-height on the far <del>right</del> <i>left, damn it</i>, about a hex beyond the edge.) It wouldn't be that far anyway if not for the water troll (n\xe4cken) and some associated hazards that make water passage difficult in the area. The lack of roads and low population density in the area do mean that the area is pretty isolated in my simulation. (I'll emphasize that I didn't have access to real demographic data for the region in the 14th century when building the sandbox, so much is guess-work and the rest is arbitrary choices for playability.)<br/><br/>Also, the Caves of Chaos in this campaign are contextualized as a sort of a last toe-hold of the jotun powers in the region. One of the big strategic arcs in the campaign was pretty much about how the PCs kept busting the last troll caves (low-level goblin nests) in V\xe4stmanland, and how this impacted the internal politics of the trolldom, who were on the edge about whether to fight for the land or retreat north to where their kin was still strong. Had the PCs succeeded in destroying the Caves, that'd have pretty much stopped trollish activity in V\xe4stmanland altogether. My backup plan for that eventuality was to offer the party a chance to follow the troll "threat" up to Dalarna to engage the G series of adventures. Sort of a Gygaxian side-line for the campaign, that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475375/#Comment_475375" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-15T11:49:44+00:00" title="July 15, 2018 11:49AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2018 11:52AM by Krippler.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes a lot more sense unless you want to recast the Swedes as the forces of chaos and the Geats as the conquerors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kurisu" title="kurisu"><img alt="kurisu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kurisu">kurisu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475378/#Comment_475378" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-15T17:16:31+00:00" title="July 15, 2018  5:16PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I ran this, the PCs did manage to convince the captain, at one point, to lend them some soldiers for a raid on the Caves.

I prepared a nice handout for it, too - a cleared exterior map of the cave entrances and the shape of the canyon. A very good initial outcome there, and a good starting point into staging a more aggressive expedition.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the party suffered of a serious lack of balls at the time - they had a leader who plays a very good game in wargaming terms, but does it in a notably methodical manner, which meant that he did his utmost to keep the party away from the court of the Troll King (as the Caves were contextualized in our campaign). This ultimately ended up very badly for the party, as they were ambushed and killed to a man by a random encounter of gnolls from the Caves on one of their light scouting missions in the area - too much messing about, too little decisive blows against the Caves, and ultimately the incidental friction did them in. Might have had more fortune if they dared to go deeper and more aggressive, actually disrupting the humanoids instead of just aggravating them with pin-pick raids.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475433/#Comment_475433" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T08:50:12+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  8:50AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2018 8:50AM by 2097.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They asked if they could buy a map at the provisioners, and I eagerly said yes, happy to get some silver in the DM's coffers<br/>But in hindsight not sure what I'll spend it on<br/><br/>Maybe some pancakes at the stretching goat                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475434/#Comment_475434" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T08:55:05+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  8:55AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The players also rolled up some npcs and had them apply for jobs at that inn.

Fortunately it's a minor issue if you're running a sandbox game anyway, and therefore doing geography routinely.<br/><br/>I wonder if that map's somehow revised for publication to make the wilderness portion entirely trivial for beginners, or if that's really the amount of game Gygax brought to his wilderness work at that point. The dollhouse-like proportions of the map make it sort of cute - I could see somebody like the Famous Five having a grand old time wandering at shouting distance to the keep, brawing the underbrush and wetlands, discovering the Caves (which the adults hadn't told them about, of course) and being sure of making it back to the keep by dinner-time [grin]. Using 100-yard squares/hexes on what amounts to the equivalent of the Hundred-Acre Wood could make for a picturesque change of pace in handling wilderness environments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475441/#Comment_475441" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T17:03:24+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  5:03PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2018 5:04PM by 2097.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's almost 2h hike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475442/#Comment_475442" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T17:04:00+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  5:04PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the famous five\u2665<br/>Anne is my fave                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475443/#Comment_475443" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T17:07:51+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  5:07PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a version called "The Little Keep on the Borderlands" that's supposedly really good                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475444/#Comment_475444" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-17T17:11:13+00:00" title="July 17, 2018  5:11PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Five kilometers by the map, seems like.

Try to be thorough; so, if your bias is one direction, rack your brains for some arguments for the "other side".<br/><br/>Next consider what people in the Keep might be particularly interested or invested in some of those arguments. Create NPCs, if necessary, and logical reasons for them to be invested in those arguments. Perhaps the local Chaplain has a mistress and child he fears for (both in terms of safety and in terms of secrecy), and therefore he will argue against leaving the Keep; make it more or less personal or logistical as fits the tone of your game.<br/><br/>Now you have, at least in theory:<br/><br/>* A fairly balanced view of the topic, despite your personal biases.<br/>* At least two NPCs with opposing interests.<br/>* A variety of interests which could, if pressed, split the Keep into factions. (And if only some of the people can be convinced, that could either endanger the expedition, or even create real conflict inside the Keep itself - or conflict between the PCs and the leadership! All interesting, gameable situations.)<br/>* A set of people for the PCs to interact with, like a large puzzle or a nuanced battlefield (e.g. if they can figure out that the archers will do whatever the Chaplain says, they just need some way to sway the Chaplain in order to get them to come over to their side).<br/><br/>I can imagine versions of this from the ludicrously complex to a fairly simple variation with just two important NPCs who prioritize different things for the Keep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475480/#Comment_475480" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-18T07:01:29+00:00" title="July 18, 2018  7:01AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great, Paul!<br/>My bias is strongly in favor of the soldiers <i>not</i>marching on the caves and I should do well to counter that bias.
