speakers.

Cultural hegemony is a culling technique to focus the noise, not silence a group of people. It's a common social ideal to begin with. When everyone is on the same page, it is easier to work together. The Forge and Story Games is proof of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBased on how you gather the cultures is what matters though. By telling any nonbelievers to eFF themselves, you'll create a hive mind that won't be productive in generating other thoughts than the status quo. If you have too many people with different agendas, the message becomes cloudy and you're less likely to actually produce something of merit. As long as both parties don't have an ego that tries to determine the alpha in the tribe, it will work out swell. It doesn't really affect discussion and design until the fore-mentioned alphas try to control the discussion/design.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, people are generally dumb when it comes to writing things. They are just words. If you disagree with a fellow designer, just make a game with the thing you wanted in the game. Readers will decide if it is superior and it doesn't need a group of designers to scrutinize it themselves.

We shouldn't stop using it. (The alternative. Not communication internationally sucks)<br><br>Awesome article link: <a href="http://gamingaswomen.com/posts/2012/06/power-privilege-and-english/" rel="nofollow">http://gamingaswomen.com/posts/2012/06/power-privilege-and-english/</a><br><br>But when using one language as the norm for international communication we should be aware there is an inbuilt power imbalance that comes with it into any conversation it used.We need to be aware that the power inbalance is there, and that it do effect the discussion.<br/><br/>Secondly, it good to look at the social norm of the conversation.<br/><br/>At the most basic level, you are silenced if you can't say anything or very little in the language. This level of being silenced you can't get around. (Without awesome translation technology. Please hurry up  world with inventing a real babelfish.) Changing social norms won't help this people.<br/><br/>On the second level there are aslo people that are silence is because of social norms. They know the language, is able to communicate in it. But are socially silences and socially ignored up to the point when they reached a very advanced level of English. There are people that could be a part of discussion.

At seven, you read Yugoslavian comics translated to your own tongue. At eight, you discussed (naively) Yugoslavian nuclear politics with your classmates. At nine, you knew that all the radio hits were in Yugoslavian, and you knew the words to many. At ten, you read your first full-length Yugoslavian novel. At eleven, you started playing Yugoslavian game books. At twelve, the Yugoslavian TV channels finally came to your country, and EVERYONE was talking about them. At thirteen, Yugoslavian restaurants came to your home town, and were the coolest of the cool. At fourteen, you were watching Yugoslavian movies in the theatre. At fifteen, your mom took you to translated Yugoslavian plays. At sixteen, you joined your first band; all the songs were in Yugoslavian, inspired by Yugoslavian bands, comics, movies. Your slang was permeated with Yugoslavian terms, swear words, expressions, cultural references.<br/><br/>As you grew older, you found yourself publishing books in Yugoslavian with Yugoslavian co-authors. Writing novels and stories with your countrymen would often bring the question: "Should we write this in Yugoslavian?"<br/><br/>And finally, there you were, on a Yugoslavian forum, writing in Yugoslavian about the Yugoslav influences in your life.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>As you might have guessed, this is about me growing up under U. S. cultural dominance. "What have the Americans ever done for us?"

That the sort of relationship I have with En--- Yugoslavian. <br/><br/>With the addition that most of my ongoing college education is either taught by the teachers in Yugoslavian, because the they are guest professors and Swedish isn't their native language or because we have guest students in the class from all over the world. Or the college text books are in Yugoslavian even if the class it taught in Swedish, because that was the best textbooks that available on the subject, and we are expected to know Yugoslavian. <br/><br/>So for me, since so much of the fiction I consume is in Yugoslavian it is the language of fiction. It is the language of epic one-liners, heroic  battle cries, and cool dialog. Of movies, books, and Tv-series. It also a language of academic subjects and other sort of intellectual stuff.  At the same time all of my "real" life has happened in Swedish, everyday life, relationships and real emotions are things I almost always express in Swedish<br/><br/>So for me Yugoslavian is always "taste" a little of fiction and/or academia, while Swedish "taste" of what is real, private, real emotions and everyday life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381162/#Comment_381162" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T07:26:29+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  7:26AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd just like to say, in my defense, that I double-posted as a test because I thought the forum code enforced slow down.<br/><br/>I don't have any interest in the English language....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381187/#Comment_381187" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T08:58:51+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  8:58AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Today's post: A followup on <b>ANALOGUE: A HATE STORY</b>.

The ones that can express themselves in english are heard, and those who can\u2019t are silenced.</i><br/><br/>That short excerpt contains 2 usages of 'privilege', 2 'hierarchy', and a 'silenced'.<br/><br/>If english is a pyramid, then the author has positioned herself as the eye-in-the-pyramid, by choosing to write-- not merely in english-- but in the rarefied, exclusionary idiom of academic theory and post-modern cultural critique.<br/><br/>'Privilege' isn't just another word.  It's a coded secret-handshake, by-which those elite few with the 'right' privileged educational opportunities and political ideologies-- who live in enough comfort to muse on such abstractions-- colonize language with the preferred cultural assumptions of their self-interested class.<br/><br/>If what I'm saying sounds paranoid, that's because I'm using the paranoid critical tools of the essay, to examine the essay itself.<br/><br/>Because I do not wish to emulate the only-find-fault-but-fail-to-offer-acceptable-solutions of those I am criticizing; I propose that the discussion and design of games would be better served by sticking to the traditional game-design assumption of an equal 'starting line', 'level playing field', and equal 'finish line' as fair enough to be acceptable.   If some of the players have a personal advantage or disadvantage prior to lining up at the starting-line; that's not a concern of the game design.  Nor are the inevitably disparate fates of the players after the finish line-- of any concern to the game.   Same with game discussion: your backstory should be treated as irrelevant. Whether you're 'sick &amp; tired of having this same discussion' is irrelevant, etc.  All that 'counts' is what you say here&amp;now, within this game/discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381391/#Comment_381391" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T06:57:35+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  6:57AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only reason we aren't all bitching that we have to know Chinese is that they don't have an alphabet.

We ARE aware of the problem, yet we fight very hard to fit into the language norms rather then to challenge them.<br/><br/>We use academic language, we have native speakers proofread our texts, and we get annoyed when fellow countrymen isn't "good enough" at English as their way of expressing them self might reflect poorly on us. Etc. Yet, we are faced with very few alternatives. The alternative to not conform to the language norms is to not be heard at all. <br/><br/>People did read my essay. Would it been read if I didn't conform to norms? Etc. Would it been taken seriously is I didn't use words as privileged, norms, and hierarchy?<br/><br/>I think we need to questions the norms before we can start to change them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
