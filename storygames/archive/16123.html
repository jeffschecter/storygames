I confess, I've gotten sucked in by the promise of Traveller-on-meth sandbox scifi play. We're starting a game in a couple weeks.<br/><br/>One of the most charming things I found about SWN is that it actively promotes hacking and houseruling. The game engine is so simple that it's also pretty easy to hack, especially if you're at all hip to how this style of game typically plays out.<br/><br/>I'm thinking about some houserules myself, mostly along the lines of ripping out the (thin to the point of transparent) XP/advancement system for something else. I'm not prepared to post the details yet, not 'til I've had a chance to see it in action. John Harper's been playing a lot of SWN, though, and <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=366337" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">he posted his house rules in another thread. </a> Surely others are running and hacking this game?<br/><br/>What are your house rules? Why did you add them? Not really interested in picking apart the suitability or function of any given hack, just curious to see what people are doing with the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SineNomine" title="SineNomine"><img alt="SineNomine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SineNomine">SineNomine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367583/#Comment_367583" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T11:58:40+00:00" title="March 14, 2012 11:58AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At times when I playtest, I find myself doing it with a single participant, or with someone who really isn't keen on the significant chance of sudden PC death inherent in the rules as written. In these cases, I make sure to get a short list of things precious to the PC, a list I add to as play progresses. I cycle things around so that I always have a handle on the three or four people/things/goals that have the most emotional purchase on the PC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the PC then gets into a situation where they would have died by the rules as written, I simply engineer matters so that they survive by the skin of their teeth. Then I look at the list, randomly pick an item off it, and break it. It doesn't necessarily have to be a direct outcome of their failure- it might be related to the actions of some other antagonist in the game, or a delayed consequence of some questionable choice the PC made some time ago, or sheer bad luck. They may not even realize what was broken until they get a message about it or return to the neighborhood. Whatever way it's broken should be a way that allows an interesting PC reaction- you can't argue with a micrometeorite strike through your daughter's vacc suit, but you can respond to the hypernationalist locals who burnt down the refugee camp you set up for some ex-slaves three sessions ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever it's sliced, every time they "die", their world gets significantly worse in a manner to which they can respond. This leaves players with the assurance that they'll be able to keep playing their character as long as they desire while simultaneously leaving them with a distinct dread of combat and other physically dangerous situations. They can never be sure what element of their world is going to be screwed over if they go down, and so naturally, they imbue the unknown with the worst possible outcomes. Simply listening to their fears often clues me in on angles and aspects that I'd never have recognized otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367679/#Comment_367679" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T16:49:31+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  4:49PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>XP for loot</b> is pretty fun. To keep things sane, I don't do 1 credit = 1 xp directly, though (storing and transporting loads of wealth isn't an issue in SWN the way it is in D&amp;D, so PCs can more easily snag gobs of credits). I usually look at all the loot and give an XP award scaled to rewards for their level -- p. 132 (or a bit higher if the haul was exceptional).<br/><br/>For example, the PCs just scored a massive haul from an adventure that I tagged as level 7, so they'll probably get something like 5,000 xp each from the loot alone.<br/><br/>We also do <b>character goals</b> (p. 65), usually 1-3 per PC. Depending on the complexity and challenge of a goal, it's usually worth between 250xp and 1500xp. A character just recently added a really tough goal, "Discover the cause of the Scream," so we initially set that at 5,000 xp. But after some reflection we thought it would be better to break that up into several smaller goals that can be achieved in sequence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367682/#Comment_367682" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T16:54:07+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  4:54PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We found the weight limits on <b>Teleportation</b> to be waaaay too low.

Charting several brand-new courses would be a big deal for a level 1 character, and get them close to leveling up. For a level 5 character, it's become old hat, so it doesn't scale up.<br/><br/>A "change the world" type goal is a level 9+ goal, but we haven't seen any of those quite yet. So far, their goals have been evolving roughly in step with the level advancement, getting a little more grandiose as we go.<br/><br/>Oh, I also do the same thing for XP rewards from Missions, which are essentially GM-authored goals that the players take on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367697/#Comment_367697" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T18:09:53+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  6:09PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our page 132s aren't the same -- what's the section that goal level business is in?<br/><br/>(I have the hardback.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367703/#Comment_367703" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T18:29:28+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  6:29PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops, sorry!

It's a modification of Burning Wheel's artha/reward cycle drawn in very broad terms: get a low-level bonus point for striving and complicating, get a high-level bonus point for achieving and per table vote (MVP, Workhorse). As you spend points, you earn your XP: 100xp per low-level (Fate), 250xp per high-level (Persona). How those points get earned is what I'm working out right now. It'll be some combination of Traits (already provided by the World Creation rules!), player-set Goals, and ... something else. Instinct maybe, or "Attitude" (Belief-ish but directed at some discrete sandbox element: faction, alien race, corporation, religion, government, planet, etc.).<br/><br/>Anyway, at least half the XPs needed to level up will need to be generated by spending your points.<br/><br/>The second half is a list of Achievements I'm working on:<br/><br/>Traveller: Visit five new planets: 1000xp<br/>Far Traveller: Visit five sectors: 2500xp<br/>Contact Specialist: Meet five alien races: 1000xp<br/>Friends In High Places: Formally ally with a faction: 500xp<br/>Enemies in High Places: Make an enemy of a faction: 500xp<br/>Visit ancient ruins: 250xp<br/>Ooh shiny: 250xp when you acquire your first artifact<br/>I am become Death: 500xp when you acquire your first piece of maltech<br/>Buy a Starship: 5000xp<br/>Savings Account: 500xp for saving up $5000<br/>1%er:2000xp for saving up $50,000<br/>Back from the dead: 500xp the first time you are resurrected<br/>Improving Your Lot: Spending 30 days at each lifestyle level is an achievement!<br/>Improving Your Lot (Slum): 100xp<br/>Improving Your Lot (Poor): 200xp<br/>Improving Your Lot (Common): 300xp<br/>Improving Your Lot (Good): 500xp<br/>Improving Your Lot (Elite): 1000xp<br/>Improving Your Lot (Peerless): 2500xp<br/><br/>My thinking here is that I want to prompt the players to go engage in the sandbox for its own sake, and this is one way of doing it. Also thinking about a "when you level up, write a new custom Achievement for someone at the table. It will be worth 100xp x the level you just achieved" type rule.<br/><br/>Anyway, no more than half your level-up can come from Achievements.<br/><br/>The points are probably off but I think this is the structure I'm gonna try out.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368146/#Comment_368146" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-16T13:53:53+00:00" title="March 16, 2012  1:53PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2012 1:54PM by rafial.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite>Since there is very little pressure in space, why not just strap [cargo] to the outside of the spaceship?

If you start strapping something to the outside, towing pods, etc, you'd have to negotiate how that modifies and limits the ship's performance. For example, maybe you simply can't spike if you are over your mass limit. And your maneuver rating drops by one, and forget about combat maneuvering.

But if the dice come up double odds ("1,1" "3,3" "5,5") then a bitter flavor gets added to the situation. If the dice come up double evens ("2,2" "4,4" "6,6") a sweet flavor is added. "Flavor" here meaning a twist or complication. Note that flavor has nothing to do with the skill and effort of the character making the roll, its possible to pull some sweet on a failure and sour an a success.

John H's earlier comment about how the two different resolution mechanics are good for giving different situations different feels was eye-opening, and a big reason I've been taking another close look at SWN, <i>but</i> it still can be tricky to deal with.<br/><br/>Rather than garnishing the D20 roll, how about borrowing a bit from <i>TORG</i> and <i>Savage Worlds</i>. Replace the D8 initiative roll with a card draw from a homemade deck of, oh, 40 cards (1-8 repeated five times, or however many are easy to reproduce on a home printer). To about a fifth of these cards add some combat-specific bad-luck events. To another fifth, add good luck events. I already like card-determined initiative because it makes it easier to keep track of. To integrate further into the system, let characters of the Warrior class ignore one bad luck event per combat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368880/#Comment_368880" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-22T09:27:33+00:00" title="March 22, 2012  9:27AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something that caught my attention and want to leverage: Lifestyle costs!<br/><br/>So there's a lifestyle cost table in the book and I've tied it into my achievements thing earlier already (xps for escalating your lifestyle) but there are a couple things I want to work out:<br/><br/>* What does each lifestyle level buy you? All that comes to mind is that "good" and up probably includes investment in a private residence somewhere. But what else might lifestyle buy you? Anything? Conditional penalties to...I don't know, some applications of Persuasion, based on proximity to the target's own lifestyle? Just spitballing here.<br/><br/>* Consequences of failing to pay for your lifestyle. How many days/weeks can go by if you literally put 0 Credits into your lifestyle? What happens? Thinking about a temporary -1 Con each week you don't pay.<br/><br/>* If you're living on a ship, how does that change your Lifestyle cost? And how does that fit, if at all, into the 100 credits/day/crewmember math (and the 20 credits/day/crewmember stores cost, which I assume is inside that 100/c/d payroll) that a ship owner has to deal with? One way: steerage conditions reduce your lifestyle cost (whatever it may be) by 15 credits (so you can life "common" at net zero or "poor" at earn 5/day), crew cabin conditions reduce by 20, luxury cabins by 50. But that feels janky and doesn't actually address the inflow-outflow math of ship ownership. Mmmaybe we take the 20/day stores cost as absolute and 100/day payroll costs as flexible -- typical crew pay is 80/day, and they can live however they want within the confines of the ship (10/20/50 per day). Anything left is gravy as long as the captain is paying. If the captain stops paying, obviously lifestyle will take a hit. And too if the captain doesn't pay for fuel the ship simply doesn't go anywhere and if he doesn't pay for stores the ship is uninhabitable.<br/><br/>This probably all sounds fussy and ridiculous, and it is, but it's also something you could set up once and forget about, until someone wants a raise or to increase their lifestyle (tied into bullet #1).<br/><br/>Seems to me like Lifestyle costs are *this* close to being a useful thing that pushes the characters deep into the sandbox. So I'm trying to hammer out the lumps to make that happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368890/#Comment_368890" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-22T10:51:06+00:00" title="March 22, 2012 10:51AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's what we're doing with Lifestyle:<br/><br/>Slum: 90 (-1 to all rolls due to poor nutrition)<br/>Poor: 300 <br/>Common: 450 (+1 to Culture rolls to interact with working-class people)<br/>Good: 750 (+1 to Culture rolls to contact or interact with rich/powerful people)<br/>Elite: 3,000 (+2 to Culture rolls to contact or interact with rich/powerful people.

I will be buying the hardcover at some stage soon tho.<br/>I'm gonna stick with SWN for now as I'm introducing my kids (10 and 12) to scifi RPGs, I've run Fantasy RPGs for them already (Pathfinder, Dragon warriors) I've actually run a scifi RPG before for them, Gammaworld, but wanted to run a more "pure" scifi for them.<br/><br/>I'm going to use our house as a gaming arena, so using figures and the first part of the campaign is to explore a tomb planet of VERY large giants..(the giants are all dead/gone now)  IE our actual house will be the gaming board, so 25mm figures exploring the entire house and putting encounters and stuff hidden all over the house as they explore..  lol <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/danskmacabre" title="danskmacabre"><img alt="danskmacabre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/danskmacabre">danskmacabre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406003/#Comment_406003" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-12T01:56:07+00:00" title="February 12, 2013  1:56AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 12, 2013 1:57AM by danskmacabre.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding house rules, I'm going to add adding of stat bonuses to saves.

Also when using a battle mat, you can run across the entire mat with a 25mm figure in 2 or 3 rounds, so it makes terrain and stuff on the mat just zoom by.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406157/#Comment_406157" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-13T14:29:10+00:00" title="February 13, 2013  2:29PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I also want to add a "Voice" dicipline like out of Dune.<br/>Other suggestions for dicliplines are welcome.<br/> </blockquote>\nI agree.

So I wanted to avoid the possibility to throw bolts of fire or stuff like that.<br/>At higher levels (from about 6 onwards) the disciplines get VERY powerful anyway.

I think I\u2019ve finally found it.<br/><br/>To review, the XP allocation method given in the SWN text is vague. Page 65 states:\n<blockquote>Characters are awarded experience points by the GM upon accomplishing certain goals, defeating meaningful enemies, or plundering insufficiently guarded wealth. It\u2019s often wise to have a word with the GM at the start of a campaign to find out just what sort of activities earn experience in his game; some GMs only award experience for accomplishing story goals, while others might only hand out rewards for acquiring great wealth. Experience point awards for defeating enemies tend to be nominal unless related to some story goal...</blockquote>\nPage 132 gives general guidelines for how much of a Reward characters should get per session, both wealth and XP simultaneously:<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>The table provided gives examples of rewards appropriate to a character of a given level. To determine the total award for an adventure, simply take the highest PC level in the group and multiply by the number of PCs. The third column shows the average number of adventures it will take for an Expert to gain a level using the award given. Warriors and Psychics will rise slightly more slowly. If you prefer a faster or slower rate of advance, just alter the numbers accordingly.</blockquote>\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much all the RaW gives you for managing advancement. There\u2019s no defined formula for attaching numbers to the accomplished goals, defeated enemies and plundered wealth alluded to. As I recall, the writer Kevin Crawford says he deliberately kept this system indistinct because he wanted to leave plenty of room for GM\u2019s to decide what earns XP in their own games. A Space Marine campaign that\u2019s mainly an ongoing bughunt would presumably stress rewards for combat, a Star Trader campaign would reward cash earned, et cetra. The problem, as I see it, is that there really should be more explicit connections between the text\u2019s clear focus on sandbox exploration and the PC-motivator that is advancement. And if you\u2019re going to present a scale of potential XP rewards of 1-to-Thousands, as implied by the Class Level progressions, there really has to be a methodology that justifies both those extremes (and not just render it meaningless by rounding it off, like AD&amp;D2 with its lazy \u201dOne-Tenth of whatever the PC needs to level up\u201d guidelines).<br/><br/>Speaking of rounding off, its tempting to go with \u201cthere are no XP, just Levels\u201d as can be done with D20, but preserving the staggered advancement rates of the different classes and a general OSR aesthetic dissuades me from that.<br/><br/>I thought about expanding on the menu of Achievements presented earlier in this discussion by PaulB, but I found it doesn\u2019t scale well (500 XP is a big boon to a 1st level character, but a mere pittance after they\u2019ve reached 9th) and too fiddly for my tastes, too subjective.<br/><br/>What I really wanted was something as elegant as the reward cycle in Old School D&amp;D, where wide varieties of adventurous player activity are encouraged by just two reward buttons: \u201csome XP for encountering opponents, more XP for recovering treasure,\u201d both of which are calculated by easy formulas. I could just implement the same buttons in SWN, but space adventure is not the same thing as dungeon delving. Long-range travel is much more common, non-violent social interaction is expected and spaceships are a distinct feature. <br/><br/>So first, I decided on a basic award formula, something that was easy to use and remember, and widely applicable:<br/><br/>(Base Stat)squared x 10<br/>[Annoyingly, this forum doesn't recognize formatting for suprerscript. In situations where the Base State is less than 1, the final XP value is 5]<br/><br/>Then I looked for ways to apply it to the core elements of space adventure I identified above:<br/><br/><b>Personal Encounters</b>: Any time the party has a perilous encounter with a being or creature, the XP reward is calculated based on their class level or HD (level is added up separately for each opponent per encounter, not totalled. 12 1HD pirates are worth 120xp, not 1440xp). Creatures with notable extra abilities can be bumped up a level or two for calculating XP. I was pleased to note the formula produces XP awards not far off from the table in BXD&amp;D. Note I intend to implement this for a variety of encounters, not just combat. Sneaking by, parlaying with and even bargaining with opponents will be rewarded, as will fast-talking the twerp in the landing tower denying you landing clearance, as will bartering for the price of silk in the bazaar (where the peril is financial).<br/><br/><b>Ships</b>:  Base Stat is the ship\u2019s Armor rating, which happens to match up well to its overall menace. Note, I intend to give out the same reward for any ship the PC\u2019s use themselves during a session. Same as with personal encounters, this isn\u2019t solely about combat.<br/><br/><b>Planets</b>: For every session the party interacts with the perilous aspects of a particular planetary environment (as opposed to just cooling heels in the spaceport) they get a reward based on 10-(the Tech Level of the planet). Admittedly, this is a bit broad and subjective.  The justification is that generally having less tech networks to fall back on makes things harder, and its a gentle push for players to look for adventure on more rugged worlds.<br/><br/><b>Factions</b>: Meaningfully encountering the Factions of a sector earns a reward based on the Faction\u2019s (Force + Cunning + Wealth). This only accounts if some significant part of the Faction is aware of the PC\u2019s interaction and may have cause to react to it specifically. Vandalizing propaganda posters of the Theocratic regime doesn\u2019t earn XP, taking up a significant mission against them (or for them) does.<br/><br/><b>Profit</b>: Not using the formula here, just straight classic 1 credit earned equals 1 XP gained. I really don\u2019t care how they profit, it can come from working part-time at a Jovian-Burger stand as much as chasing bounties; I trust players would rather do the interesting thing.<br/><br/>At first, I wanted to also calculate awards for distance travelled (both on a planet and through space) but couldn\u2019t think of any approach that wasn\u2019t too subjective, and also realized that, like number of bullets fired or hours strived, travel is just a means to achieve objectives and doesn\u2019t have to be tracked.<br/><br/>In practice, it should play out like so:  The party encounters an expatriate naval officer, who hires them to contact someone on the next planet and recover a dossier. Price is haggled, and agreed at 5,000 plus passage. They travel coach to the planet, sneak around a bit, fight some guards, find the contact, get the dossier, then trek over desert and steal a shuttle to get past the Spaceport lockdown. Back at the starting point, they ditch the stolen shuttle and collect their payment. <br/><br/>160xp for the expat officer encounter (fourth level).<br/>0xp for the trip out (didn\u2019t fly their own ship or encounter one on the way) <br/>490xp for time on planet (Tech 3)<br/>80xp for sneaking past soldiers and peons (four 1hd, one 2hd)<br/>150xp for fighting a guard squad (six 1hd, 1 3hd)<br/>90xp for finding the contact (third level)<br/>5xp for stealing/flying the shuttle<br/>640xp for working for the Freedom Fighters faction (total faction stats of 8).<br/>5,000xp for fee.<br/>Total of 6,615xp to be divided among the characters who survived the adventure.<br/><br/>Supplemental, with this clearer reward system laid out, I think I\u2019d like to put together some random tables generating \u201cJobs for Hire\u201d much like the Patron and Merc Ticket systems in classic Traveller.   <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426216/#Comment_426216" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-23T15:32:37+00:00" title="December 23, 2013  3:32PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool stuff.<br/><br/>Be careful about "any profit counts as xp" though.

To curtail it, I'll limit rewards to "hands-on profit," money that characters earn themselves through direct action and personal peril. Calling up a broker to buy some hot Mithril Metal Mining shares, not so much. Call it the Scrooge McDuck Clause (in the comics, the coins and cash in Scrooge's money bin was only a fraction of his total wealth, but represented what he had earned directly through his own personal toil, not investments or interest).\n<blockquote>Seriously!

This eliminated the possibility of ties, made it easier to track and (as a minor aside) made it harder to cheat initiative. Over several plays the system developed so that it also provided tactical choices without a map and a bit of battlefield chaos. Enough players commented positively on this approach that it seems worth sharing publicly.<br/><br/>Use a single shuffled pack of regular playing cards, with the jokers.<br/><br/>[Aside: I prefer a deck of <a href="http://www.copagcards.com/copag-bridge-sets/copag-epoc-bridge-jumbo.html" rel="nofollow">Copag EPOC</a> plastic cards, for ease of shuffling and (somewhat) in-genre presentation. This <a href="http://www.collectableplayingcards.com/bicycle-starlight-playing-cards-collectable-playing-cards-p-46796.html" rel="nofollow">Starlight</a> deck is also aesthetically tempting.]<br/><br/>When a combat begins, deal every character a single card, including NPC's. Groups of cannon-fodder opponents can be treated as mobs of up to six or so figures per card.<br/><br/>Characters receive an additional card per point of Dexterity bonus, and another one per +4 Attack Bonus.<br/>[Experts: Lvls 9, 17. Psychics: Lvl 11. Warriors: Lvls 7, 13, 19]<br/><br/>At the start of each round of combat, each player chooses one of their cards to be their initiative. At the end of the round, used cards are collected and every character is dealt a single new card. <br/>[I don't bother to reshuffle used cards back into the deck until its half-used. Except for jokers, which I shuffle back in at the end of each round.]<br/><br/>Initiative is counted down from Aces to Dueces (A,K,Q,J,10-2). Ties are resolved in alphabetical order of the suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades).<br/><br/>However, Face cards and Aces are considered to represent Opportunites the character has the option of seizing, at the cost of having the value "reversed," putting them at the end of the initiative order (so thhe full initiative progression is A,K,Q,J,10-2,rJ,rQ,rK; for reasons stated below, reversed-Ace isn't used).<br/><br/>The possible opportunites are:<br/>Jack = Double movement rate for the round, or take a +2 bonus to saving throws and Armor Class<br/>Queen = take a +1 bonus to a skill roll or a +2 bonus to an attack roll<br/>King = Take a bonus action<br/>Ace = take any of the J,Q,K oppurtunities, or skip the round entirely to catch their breath and recover HP equal to 1HD+level. <br/><br/>[at least those're the Oppurtunities I generally use; they can be swapped for others more appropriate to the current battlefield/situation]<br/><br/>Jokers cause chaos. When one is played, the player immediately draws another card to use as their initiative (so playing a joker can be a gamble to get a high card). However, the GM gets to mandate some unexpected complication for the character. A weapon jams, they trip over debris, their compad fritzs out, something like that. If their second card is also a joker, then the complication affects the entire battlefield and everyone on it. A stray bullet punctures the hull, sparks flash from a severed power main, a dust devil kicks up sand, etc.<br/><br/>As said, I like this approach because it creates the feeling of nuanced battlefield, with potential openings and changing conditions, without requiring any pre-scripting or mapping.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438614/#Comment_438614" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-22T17:03:03+00:00" title="September 22, 2014  5:03PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.

Each subsequent round, they and everyone else gets just one. So extra cards, if you warrant any at all, are a resource to be shrewdly used for the entire combat. Some players have asked why they'd bother to use a low card in lieu of a high one, to which I reply that banking the high card gives you the chance to unleash it on the most useful round, rather than taking it when it comes up.<br/><br/>An interesting side-effect is that characters who get extra cards become a sort of joker-filter, since they have higher odds of drawing them but can choose to use a different card. Thus having a quick combat-savvy fighter in the mix ends up making the fight go smoother for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440610/#Comment_440610" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-03T07:02:22+00:00" title="December  3, 2014  7:02AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basically I'm just using this thread to keep track of SWN hacks as I think them up. And I'll be running SWN at Boston's Arisia again in January, so I've been mulling more ideas lately.<br/><br/>First, a minor tweak, codifying something John Harper touched on elsewhere about Backgrounds and Training Packages, that they should count for more than just the specific skills they grant. I'll rule that for any task or challenge which seems within the umbra of the character's Background or Package, they're always considered to have at least Trainee level (0); a soldier may be no doctor, but sure knows damn well how to apply a field dressing. Also, Backgrounds and Trainings can be invoked for contacts when in the right places (the "Circles" mechanic mentioned upthread).<br/><br/>Next, I'm still not quite there with XP. Most of the system I lay out above I'm still pleased with, but I keep chewing over the rewards-for-cash part. I very much want to encourage players to shwredly consider risk-versus-reward, but cash is a very volatile  pay-off. Its easy for characters to salvage thousands of credits from the aftermath of even a modest mission, and as they grow in levels they will, not unreasonably, expect bigger fees for their services / rewards for their heroics (and things like "50,000 unmarked credits in a jump satchel" are very in genre). Looking back in this thread, again, mention of the Lifestyle threshholds has me thinking something might be derived from them. Perhaps evaluate a reward by what level of lifestyle it can support for 30 days, number the levels (Slum = 0, Peerless = 5) and use that as the Base State for the "(Base Stat)squared x 10" to derive XP.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455789/#Comment_455789" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-24T20:34:35+00:00" title="August 24, 2016  8:34PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re-reading this thread and daydreaming about <a href="https://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2016/08/08/stars-without-number-welcome-to-sector-hades-zeta/" rel="nofollow">Sector Hades Zeta</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16123/stars-without-number-your-house-rules" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16123/stars-without-number-your-house-rules" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16123/stars-without-number-your-house-rules/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16123%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16123%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
