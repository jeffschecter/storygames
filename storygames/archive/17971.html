Because the GM is God!" "No, the players, because they elect the God and can walk out!" -- You're better off not going down the "final say" rabbit hole to begin with).</blockquote>\nThis is why I refer to 'sympathetic decision'. In the quoted example, that sympathy between participants about contributions is absent, it's an out and out power struggle. If it were a jam session then it'd be one musician raising his instrument and bashing the other musician in the head with it, so only the first musician is heard.<br/><br/>The irony is that that bashing in the head is usually triggered by the very idea there is no final say and we all 'know' the supposed 'one' fictional space. Primed with this myth, someones idea of the fiction goes out of sync with others, but they don't acknowledge it as having gone out of sync; under the idea of the myth, to them there is only ONE fictional space and someone else is failing to refer to it! So to them it's as if someone has shifted the pieces on the chess board - just out and out cheating! "Of freakin' 'course I have height advantage!?' 'Of freakin' 'course I can grab the can of peaches! It's right in front of my character!'. At that point, they think they can shout over the person who, textually, has the final say. Cue the power struggle from the quote. Which ironically, by the text, isn't legitimate play.<br/><br/>Once the ignoring of who textually has the final say is legitimised, then over some amount of time participants realise that they have hit a Mutually Assured Destruction situation. Cold war like, they retreat and avoid the rabbit hole. However, it tends to lead to play like <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/405301#Comment_405301" rel="nofollow">Matrix Gamer</a> describes, where certain individuals, mostly based on social politics, get the most say. Which Matrix Gamer then goes to fix by...having a mechanic which determines who gets the final say. I think he does really well at simply approaching and dealing with the taboo rabbit hole.<br/><br/><br/>Hi Rafu,<br/><br/>My contention is that it is always there, in all gaming, good or bad. It's not a sub case, it's all roleplaying. It depends - you might think I'm refering to a GM ignoring mechanics as his reaction to others spoken fiction, when the game text does not permit him to ignore the mechanics. I'm not, I'm only refering to where the text permits him to ignore/not use mechanics that the text specifies.<br/><br/><br/>Hi Deliverator,\n<blockquote>But he's wrong in practice that the GM can deny you the use of the mechanics willy-nilly, because play will break down really, really fast if that happens more often than once in a blue moon.</blockquote>\nLike I said to Rafu I'm only refering to where the text says the GM may deny you the use of a mechanic that that same text specifies.<br/><br/>If you are refering to the GM denying you use of mechanics when the text permits him to do so, at his will, as being something that breaks down play really fast...that's another kettle of fish. Which do you mean?<br/><br/><br/>AMBayard,<br/><br/>I appreciate your support, but why does everyone have to remain ignorant? I mean, rather like when watching the muppet show one forgets that they are puppets, one might forget the exact ways spoken fiction and sympathy interact. But one still knows they are puppets, even as you enjoy Kermit as a character?  Or do I simply make an excuse to talk about the Muppets? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/><br/>Zachary,\n<blockquote>If I'm understanding correctly, though, the point is that a having a human-being make decisions on when and when not to use the rules based off of interpretation won't always be a problem, but because it is potentially a problem</blockquote>\nThe first thing I'll say is to repeat one of Ron's rants about not just playing with 'anyone who'll let you' and instead play with people who you do other things with in life.<br/><br/>The next thing is - it is not a problem! It's a matter of how much control the text of an RPG hands over to someone (like a GM), and simply your own preference for how much control you want to hand over. If an RPG X gives over more control than you feel like giving over, don't play RPG X. Universalis is alot more conservative and currency based in it's handing over of power, for example, than traditional RPG's are.<br/><br/>"But what if I choose a level and the GM has nonsensical stuff happen?"<br/><br/>Okay, I'm going to assume a GM who is genuinely trying to present his creative output.<br/><br/>Okay, this is just cultural diversity. This is like when you watch manga for the first time and it's crazy ass! It's nonsensical, but it also makes sense - in time you will see sense from another persons perspective. You are stepping into someone elses culture. Welcome it!<br/><br/>"But I chose a game who's campaigns last for 3 RL years and I can't take the crazy for that long!"<br/><br/>Oh crap! Yeah, more needs to be said on this, but I'm stretching this post as is...\n<blockquote>Now, the immediate problem is - how? By nature, RPGs deal with creative fictional improvisation, which is something that cannot be quantified, codified, or categorized without a judgement call by somebody. Video games handle this through the use of a processor and hard-coded limitations. I suppose you could remove the judgement call by limiting what kind of fiction the players and GM can bring into the game? That sounds like you'd lose more than you gain though.</blockquote>\nIn designing, you don't need to manage the fictional improvisation - you only need to manage where it plugs into the mechanics. Which mechanics is the GM granted control of? I know, the tradition is the golden rule: He controls all of them. But....let's not go there.<br/><br/>Also it's a question of endgame and whether mechanics determine when you get there (and to which endgame you get) or whether you leave it up to the GM as to whether you get toward endgame - the latter can be real problematic in how much control the game hands over.<br/><br/>Also I might not understand what you mean - for some people 'creative fictional improvisation' means skipping rules (when the text does not permit this) or even creating new rules mid play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406293/#Comment_406293" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T06:04:41+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  6:04AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm only refering to where the text permits him to ignore/not use mechanics that the text specifies.</blockquote>\nDoes the text do this?

Where there is a lack of syncronisity, there needs to be a 'final say' role as assigned by the text, to finalise a syncronisation amongst participants - and the texts you mention consistantly fail to assign such a role. Because the author, as much as we all lack perspective on our perspective, confuses his notion of 'normal' to be the only one in existance and thus as if the only one everyone uses.<br/><br/>I mean, you say 'but not as a normal thing'. Who judges whether it's a normal thing or not? You? Me? What if we disagree? Where's the final say?<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be the tradtional 'A GM has final say' - all sorts of different distribution mechanics for the final say could be used. Everyone puts in their say into a hat, draw it out at random, for example. Or many other methods.<br/><br/>I know it seems like "No, the traditional rules don't just let the GM pass on rules just whenever, arbitrarily!". Except they do - for something to be not arbitrary, then it has to be a system (or is there something both not arbitrary and not system?). No system is in place amongst the rules for it. So it's arbitrary.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406372/#Comment_406372" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-15T21:09:21+00:00" title="February 15, 2013  9:09PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, we had a discussion like this a while back (I can't remember what it was entitled), and a member started hunting down those passages in his older RPG books.

I think that can fail even with a "final say" system in place; that there's definitelly more to the "synchronisation" than having a mechanic to apportion final say; and that the whole "play with people you do other things in life with" thing is pretty much a shorthand way of dismissing many "not on the same page" problems that people (even people who are close) can face during a game.<br/><br/>All of which don't seem like major disagreements, though.<br/><br/>I am pretty sure that I as a GM can fail at synching even if I am following the rules of the game, am acting in good faith, and have final say.<br/><br/>Callan seems to say, as far as I can tell, that such failures are definitelly possible, but they're the failure of the design of the game and not the GM (because, well, what could have he done differently, in the above example?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406391/#Comment_406391" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T04:40:00+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  4:40AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, when I wrote "not as a normal thing" I meant that most rules texts, in my memory, <i>don't</i> tell the GM to violate the rules.  (I'm thinking from your response that you thought I meant that texts instruct GMs to violate the rules, but to do so only infrequently...?)<br/><br/>What I specifically mean can be directed to something you just wrote: "...there needs to be a 'final say' role as assigned by the text..."<br/><br/>Oh yeah?  And what if there isn't?  I mean, the fact that you have declared this need, doesn't actually bend reality.  And I think that there are many RPG rules texts that do not assign that  the 'final say' role.<br/><br/>But that's maybe nit-picking?  You started this with "I'll say my usual that that 'needs to have fictional positioning to take action' is actually 'speak fiction that plays upon the GM's sympathy that he permits some game mechanics use that he can deny the use of if he so wishes'."  But really?  <br/><br/>Say I'm sitting around the table with four other people.  Let's even grant that one of them is a DM, GM, MC, HG or whatever.

Assuming we, as a group, agree that there is a can of peaches on that table, presumably because another player, possibly the one with the special designation, said that they put it there.  I can just state to the table, "I take that can of peaches" and then I do whatever bookkeeping is involved in 'adding it to my inventory.'

It's as ambiguous as the length of a piece of string.<br/><br/>Currently it's left to the GM's sympathy of whether the fictional notion of the can is 'in front of you'.<br/><br/>Also your example doesn't have any spoken fiction toward your PC's position.

Partially because I don't know how a text could do that.<br/><br/>Just looking at one shot games for now, it's a matter of players commiting to playing the game.<br/><br/>The final say, if it's present, is something they have commited to in commiting to the game. Players listen to the final say and syncronise themselves to that. That's the commitment.<br/><br/>You don't fail as GM in regard to synching in such a situation - it's the player reneging on their commitment.<br/><br/>Such reneging (where a final say actually exists in the text) is often treated as normal play in the hobby, atm (perhaps becoming slowly less so over the years). Ie the breaking of commitment being not treated as a break at all and instead as sacrosanct right of the player. As if, if they act fractious about synchronising, someone other than them is at fault (ie, the GM failed at syncronising).<br/><br/><br/>Hi Summerdown,<br/><br/>It would look like as you describe? I'm not sure of your point? Though in the second two example it shows a stalled situation with no mechanical system that will get us toward endgame. That's a related subject (as endgame always is), but not really on topic?<br/><br/><br/>JDCorley,<br/><br/>This isn't a rules dispute (like '30% skill +5% skill per level' and 'so I get that at first level on top of the 30%?' is a rules dispute). Does the mechanic get used or not? The person with the final say, after hearing the prior spoken fiction, decides. Other than that instead of simply trying random configurations, I'd say follow a theme in designing you game and determining who has final say (there can be final says on various seperate bits of mechanics - the multiple final says could be distributed to various seperate individuals).

If the only thing that keeps the mechanics as written from falling apart is the idea that the GM should not be a big jerk and, for instance, make 40 dragons attack a weak character (which is technically possible under many systems), then it means that the mechanics aren't all that important compared to the inherent judgment of the GM. The 40 dragon thing is an extreme example of course, but the idea is just as applicable to all kinds of common decisions. <br/><br/>I don't think the issue is "bad;" it's just the way it is. I think it's worth thinking about it though in order to discuss the distinction between games in which the rules govern the actions of the characters like, say, Hero System, and games in which the rules govern the actions of the players like, say, Polaris. In the former, though mechanically dense, fiction is really king, and in the later, the mechanics have more teeth.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406794/#Comment_406794" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T01:44:24+00:00" title="February 21, 2013  1:44AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2013 1:46AM by Callan_S.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The massive difference between A: "You can manouver in the fiction and that lets you do things/enact rules" Vs B: "You can speak fiction in the hope of garnering a sympathetic rules invocation from the GM" aught to make it's own point on a number of levels. If you design around A when it's really B that is happening, your design is going to have all sorts of weird side effects occuring as principles that bank on A existing obviously teeter as it doesn't exist. Never mind unforfillable social contracts, as people try to forfil A when only B is possible, and the social fallout from that ("don't be a douche/jerk" 'advice' that runs through gamer culture is the shadow of that fallout). The question to ask is: Is the idea of A haunting your game?<br/><br/>I pretty much agree with AMBayard's outline, except that the inherant judgment of the GM goes even further than most people seem to think and also that fiction is not king - someone at the table is. The final say, when not assigned by the text, ends up falling into someones lap, even if it's by social pecking order.<br/><br/>Much like a magic show can still appear magic, you can still have it appear that fiction is king. I think it's great to enjoy that appearance. The only thing I'd say is bad is to think the magic show involves real magic. If we want to really look at accounts, like scrutinising a magic show, you can't just go by appearance. Discard the idea that fiction is king and instead see the social interactions behind the appearance.<br/><br/>Basically the more you believed that the fiction was in charge, the more the ramifications will show as you look into what is actually occuring. If it doesn't seem to abound with ramifications, ironically either you don't believe in A (or don't believe it very much), or you believe wholeheartedly in A.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_406796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406796/#Comment_406796" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T03:21:39+00:00" title="February 21, 2013  3:21AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But it's not necessarily by pecking order, which implies an inherent hierarchy.

Otherwise, someone will have to parse the fiction spoken at the table and decide, with an informed judgement call, when the rules kick in. So you're either playing a game where there are clean-cut limitations as to how the mechanics are interfaced (like chess), or you let people say pretty much whatever they want and interpret that creativity into something that can interface with mechanics (like all of the RPGs that I've played so far). <br/><br/>I guess, maybe I'm still missing the point of your comments? To me, it kind of seems like you're beating around the bush - trying to let us figure out what you're trying to say as opposed to straight up saying it. Like, are you trying to educate us on a poor design approach? Warn us of potential problems during play? Inform us on issues you've experienced before? Or just discuss theory for fun?

I'd so no, not at all - what you have is a choice in designing much as AMBayard outlines in comparing Hero with Polaris - ie, how much you design it to let 'fiction be king'/how much you hinge play on a final say Vs making a design that controls play more.<br/><br/>In regard to your second paragraph: you haven't mentioned A or B, when A is a bit like I've said 'planes fly through summoned wind spirits' (while B says aerodynamics), which I would think is deserving of some note in how different they are from each other.<br/><br/>This idea pertains to people who believe in A. For me to go any further with you on this subject you'd need to either state you believe A, or state you believe part of the time it's B but part of the time it's also A.<br/><br/>If you don't believe in the former or latter and believe only B is the case, cool. But I got nothing for you in that case (unless you happen to still design with A in mind every so often by mistake. It happens.). I'm just trying to make clear for people who believe in A that A doesn't exist.\n<blockquote>If I surmise correctly, Callan, you advocate removing the necessity for trust at the table, yes? No? Maybe so? </blockquote>\nThis isn't about trust - If I say the magician isn't using real magic, it's not because I don't trust him - it's because it's a fact. Here it's a fact (or so I contend) that A is false and B true.<br/><br/>Are you trying to say A is true, it's just that I didn't trust enough?<br/><br/>In the article you linked, check out 'Sure, sometimes you need to be firm and hold your ground. Sometimes you fight for your specific vision of the game. But when it comes from a place of trust, you're fighting with your respected peers.' and see how it doesn't actually describe how such a fight (to use his own words) is resolved? Heck, I'd accept 'thumb wrestling' being given as a resolution method - but nothing has been given.<br/><br/>I don't know how much that article seems the answer to you, but to me it just begs the question.<br/><br/><br/><b>Graham</b>, I'd question if there isn't a final say in those consensuses that 'just form' that you describe. But ignoring that for now, you say groups can <i>often</i> reach consensus. But often is not always. What about those other times?<br/><br/><br/><b>Gareth</b>, it's the intransigent players who become the 'final say' in your example, not the GM (unless everyone else just gives up and walks away from the table). I said the final say will fall into someones lap - I didn't say it'd just automatically fall into the GM's lap. <br/><br/>Otherwise it's exactly as you say - when someone is intransigent at the table, without a rule above them on who gets the last say, then the intransigent player gets it (unless everyone else leaves the table).<br/><br/><br/><b>Komradebob</b>, I'm not sure what you're asking - you seem to be asking "What difference does it make to design if people base their design on a principle (A) that can't exist rather than one (B) that does exist?"<br/><br/>You don't think it'll make a big difference and avoid various disasters if one designs based on principles that actually exist rather than false principles??<br/><br/><br/><b>WarriorMon</b>k, "Say yes or roll" is a kind of final say determining mechanic in itself. It still leaves quite a few variables up in the air, but that's better than leaving everything up in the air. The reason it's become popular is precisely because fictional positioning does not work as a way of invoking rules.<br/><br/><br/><b>Vernon</b>,\n<blockquote>or someone is going to have to make the call. Whoever makes that call will be subject to social pressure, that's the nature of human existance. </blockquote>\nIt depends if you believe in A, that fictional positioning happens and determines what rules are used.<br/><br/>If you don't, that's cool and what you say is accurate.

However, and all the same, there are some interesting effects around "fictional legitimacy", which do affect people's behaviour.<br/><br/>That said, however, there are ways to design around fictional assent. For instance, notice how in a game like Wushu (or Raises in DitV, or any other game where narration colours a certain game action), it's much easier to get assent for a narrated action than in, say, D&amp;D Basic. When a game is set up so that both parties benefit from assenting to a certain bit of fiction, rejections become very unlikely, and the "mother may I" issue shrinks down to the point of seeming to leave the room in many cases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406885/#Comment_406885" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T18:24:11+00:00" title="February 21, 2013  6:24PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2013 7:05PM by Callan_S.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Zach</b>, as I said you need to either state you believe A to be the case, or I have no discussion for you on the matter (because either it doesn't apply to you or it applies but no admission of that has been made by you).

Really any RPG that uses someone to judge whether a rule/resource is enacted/given (ie, a GM sympathy method) could be said to be using mother may I. Really I'd reserve that name for games which use massive amounts of it - which are the older RPG's and as you say, the bulk of RPG's.

And although in the case of a guitar the absence is pivotal, when is that advertised as a positive? People instead talk about the quality of the wood/it's tenor, if it's electric and you can plug it in, the weight, etc and what positive aspects it might have in regard to these things.<br/><br/>I'll go a step further and suggest the RPG tradition has been not to sell guitars, but splinters of wood, glue, tiny bits of wire, pegs - and call it a musical instrument (a game). Ie, the fetishisement of the absence of the guitar playing itself, right down to having to build the thing from scratch every session, in order to play it. I think newer games, starting at around the time of Capes RPG, are moving on from that and actually providing a pre assembled instrument, so to speak. You can just play them (ignoring gaining skill at playing for now - as that's a different skill than instrument assembly)<br/><br/>I would say where you have the absence in the design, in regard to what mechanics are instead handed over to GM sympathy, is a PIVOTAL part of game design. Maybe this is what you meant - not so much promoting the absence, but how each game designs particular and careful use of GM sympathy makes it a brand new instrument ready to play really quite different music. Heck, I certainly get chills down my spine (in a good way!) thinking about that!<br/><br/>As a side note, the absence probably ties in the notion of the fruitful void.<br/><br/>But basically I'd say in terms of GM sympathy mechanics - Less is More! I think newer games like 3:16 use less of it - and to more effect. So I wouldn't say to promote GM sympathy in itself, since that might come across as saying 'Use MOAR!'. Use less - and it will be a powerful less! While more just seems to produce a mother may I game.<br/><br/>Or alternatively; I agree on the promotion, but with a few caveats tacked on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406994/#Comment_406994" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T06:29:45+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  6:29AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still kinda lost Callan.<br/><br/>It sounds to me a bit like you've come to a realiation that I had some time ago ( and I suspect a lot of folks also had) and are working your way through the implications of it right now.<br/><br/>The realization works something like this:<br/>In theory, RPGs have all of these rules. Do fictional thing X, and related mechanics are engaged to deal with it.<br/><br/>In practice, the way RPGs actually work is: Say fictional stuff X in a way that convinces the GM to engage those particular mechanics.[ Or alternately in some cases, convinvce the GM to <i>not</i> engage those mechanics].<br/><br/>The problem: Lots of people are convinced that the first thing is what happens, and ignore what is actually occuring and that creates all kinds of problems ( sometimes), especially when no one wants to talk about the fact that second ( the practice) is what is happening. For example, knowing all of the mechanics for fighting a spaceship battle is nifty, but ultimately deeply secondary to knowing how to convince the GM to use/not use those mechanics.<br/><br/>Am I about on the right track with this?<br/><br/>If I am right, then yeah, I found it a shocking moment of realization myself. SOYLENT GREEN IS MADE OF PEOPLE!!!<br/><br/>Or well I guess the RPGer equivalent might be: OMG! THIS IS ALL JUST PLAY-PRETEND + MOTHER-MAY-I WRAPPED UP IN TOLKIEN DRAG WITH SOME WEIRD DICE!!!!!<br/><br/>That was my moment of realization anyway. Different people react to that differently.<br/><br/>One reaction, and one we see around here a lot (including in some of the games you've been mentioning) is: If you're going to have rules, use the damn rules. And, if you're designing a game, design rules that you intend to have used. Don't just create another tome of stuff that is basically a prop for what in practice amounts to yet another version of TolkienDragMOtherMayI.<br/><br/>And that is a pretty understandable reaction to that moment of clarity and insight. I really can feel for the person who has that moment of clarity and then snaps to the conclusion that all of that stuff they have been doing has been a crock of bullshit since it was really TolkienDragMotherMayIPlayPretend the whole time and decides to fly in another direction design and playwise.<br/><br/>I certainly have had that moment myself.<br/><br/>Here's another moment of clarity that I had later: Actually, TolkienDragMOtherMayIPlayPretend can be lots of fun.<br/><br/>And that's where my current thinking comes around into this. What are the implications of cutting the bullshit and saying straight up: Hey, the core of this thing is <i>TolkienDragMOtherMayIPlayPretend</i> ? What does it mean for how you present a game? What does it mean for any mechanics associated with it? What does it mean for gametext as commercial product?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406995/#Comment_406995" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T06:39:01+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  6:39AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2013 6:39AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407044/#Comment_407044" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T15:15:07+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  3:15PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bob (and, as far as I understand '+1', Zach), you're still trying to treat mothermayI as an existant feature, not as an absence as I described above.<br/><br/>In a way you're still trying to treat the fictional positioning as real. It's just now you're trying to treat mothermayI as an existant, real thing.<br/><br/>It's like you're trying to say the core of this guitar thing is that it doesn't play itself and as if not playing itself is a valuable thing that exists.<br/><br/>Your OMG moment was not complete.<br/><br/>MothermayI is not fun - it is not fun like "guitars don't play themselves" is not fun. NO ONE gets excited that guitars don't play themselves - <i>let go</i> of mothermayI as fun! The core of the thing is NOT mothermayI as much as the core of a guitar is NOT that it does not play itself. Even though it's pivotal that to be an instrument, it does not play itself. It's pivotal, yet it's mere absence. Don't fetish an empty grave.<br/><br/>Or instead treat mothermayI as the important, enjoyable in itself feature - it'll just be the new fictional positioning. And I'll figure out a short standard rant to drop about it when it every so often raises itself to scrutiny.<br/><br/>But at the very least, tell me we both agree that "a guitar doesn't play itself" isn't interesting or enjoyable in itself? Surely we both agree on that (genuine question, not rhetorical)? Even if you don't agree it has connotations for mothermayI?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407047/#Comment_407047" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T15:58:26+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  3:58PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2013 2:05PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you give an example that highlights the problem, and then an example of how to solve it?<br/><br/>(Super confused as well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407052/#Comment_407052" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T16:27:45+00:00" title="February 23, 2013  4:27PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, truly I have no clue what you're talking about Callan.

But when I do the exact opposite and say it's something <i>missing </i>in the product, you tell me you don't understand how what I've said ties into promoting mothermayI as a feature <i>present</i> in the product.<br/><br/>MothermayI is a product of something an RPG LACKS.<br/><br/>You all seem to treat mothermayI as something an RPG HAS.<br/><br/>Which, okay, is your position. But a contrary notion that it's something lacking from a game shouldn't be all that confusing. Maybe you'd argue it is present, which is a valid argument to take up. But it's not confusing. Like, at all.<br/><br/>MothermayI is like the hole in a donut. Its a product of something that is missing.<br/><br/>I come across as confusing because you all treat the hole as if it's a tangible, real thing with existant qualities (to be presented as a feature). Then when I say the hole doesn't exist, you think I'm not talking about the same thing. I am though - it might destroy a series of cherished values, but I am.<br/><br/>Another non rhetorical question: If one guy talks about the hole in a donut as an existant thing and I talk about it as something the donut lacks, am I talking about the same thing as him or am I being confusing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407136/#Comment_407136" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T21:07:07+00:00" title="February 24, 2013  9:07PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really, really need you to be more concrete in what you're talking about, Callan.

I'm really trying to understand -- especially since I thought that I already understood, and evidently didn't. I agree with Deliverator -- can you restate without using any figurative language? No analogies or metaphors. Is your point really distinct from Komradebob's quote below? \n<blockquote>The realization works something like this:<br/>In theory, RPGs have all of these rules. Do fictional thing X, and related mechanics are engaged to deal with it.<br/><br/>In practice, the way RPGs actually work is: Say fictional stuff X in a way that convinces the GM to engage those particular mechanics.[ Or alternately in some cases, convinvce the GM to <i>not</i> engage those mechanics].<br/><br/>The problem: Lots of people are convinced that the first thing is what happens, and ignore what is actually occuring and that creates all kinds of problems ( sometimes), especially when no one wants to talk about the fact that second ( the practice) is what is happening. For example, knowing all of the mechanics for fighting a spaceship battle is nifty, but ultimately deeply secondary to knowing how to convince the GM to use/not use those mechanics.<br/><br/>Am I about on the right track with this?<br/></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407170/#Comment_407170" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T07:45:34+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  7:45AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2013 7:53AM by Vernon R.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The answer I believe Callan is looking for is that nobody believes that a guitar plays itself.<br/><br/>What his analogy misses though is that "Fictional Positioning" isnt a thing like a guitar it's a thing like the music playing.  It inherently takes into account that it's an active thing created on both sides.  It's a conversation about the world and the situation our game is set in and a call to provide more detail about them so we can all be on the same page.  The idea that it's the player trying to gain sympathy from the gm to get what he wants in the game while it may be true is entirely wrong headed, the game is about the fiction we are creating so it's the character in the game trying to utilize his/her strengths and abilites to their advantage.   Once we have that fictional situation resolved and we know what is in question then we can move to whatever real world mechanical resolution system we've chosen.  Those arent lacking in rpg's.<br/><br/>Or at least that is my response to what I imagine his criticism to be, I confess that my certainty about it isnt all that high.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407176/#Comment_407176" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T09:08:45+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  9:08AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2013 9:15AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Another non rhetorical question: If one guy talks about the hole in a donut as an existant thing and I talk about it as something the donut lacks, am I talking about the same thing as him or am I being confusing?</blockquote>\nYou're being confusing. That should be quite clear by everyone's "Huh?" response. If it's really that hard to clarify what you're talking about, it makes me think you don't really know what you're talking about, or you're avoiding the clarification because then it seems less significant or poignant then. \n<blockquote>Guys, I asked a question which I specifically said wasn't rhetorical. That no one attempted to answer it is a hallmark that it's not that you don't understand but that you aren't paying attention.</blockquote>\nCallan...<br/><br/>You have multiple people telling you they have no idea what you're talking about (which means I haven't been too dumb to figure you out for the past seven years like I thought!). There have been multiple non-rhetorical questions posed to you that you've refused to acknowledge. Multiple people have tried to frame the discussion into a clear and concise point that be summed up into a design goal or trap, but apparently nobody's summary has hit the nail on the head. Multiple people have asked you to try to be straight up and stop using metaphors or random meaningless examples ("A is a bit like I've said 'planes fly through summoned wind spirits' while B says aerodynamics" - ...WTF?). The least you can do, out of respect for your fellow role-playing game enthusiasts, is make an attempt to clarify yourself instead of blaming everyone else in the thread for not giving you their full attention. We're not here trying to push an agenda or tell you you're wrong or fight against your line of thinking.<br/><br/>I thought for sure Komradebob had this all figured out, and I think he actually did figure out what you're talking about (he must have since you didn't respond with "No no no that's not what I'm talking about - this is what I'm talking about..."). The problem is, his response wasn't the conclusion you were looking for. He figured out what you're talking about, but didn't decide that Mother-May-I was unacceptable, like you seem to think. Rather, Bob is saying that games that use Mother-May-I are okay and can be fun without any problems.<br/><br/>So, in yet ANOTHER attempt to clarify your point of view (seeing as how you're apparently unable to do so yourself), you're asserting that, since most RPGs do not spell out a proper method for determining which vision of the fiction is true or when the fiction prompts the use of mechanics, people naturally fall back to Mother-May-I. That's where your donut hole argument comes in. The donut is the game, the hole is the lack of rules to handle fiction-to-mechanics procedure, and Mother-May-I is something the players use to fill in that hole on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407183/#Comment_407183" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T09:35:07+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  9:35AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, which games have the quality you are referring to?<br/>Very interesting topic, btw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407193/#Comment_407193" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T10:12:37+00:00" title="February 25, 2013 10:12AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2013 1:32PM by AMBayard.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not yet sure if I follow Callan's issue, but the issue described by Komradebob and Zachary_Wolf has interesting practical effects. There was a recent thread about player vs. player battles in Dungeon World where this point seemed to matter. The crux of the argument was that (to me anyway) it didn't seem fair that "fictional positioning" determined which player used which move (and, thus, who had a mechanical advantage) because the fiction was ultimately determined by the GM. So (to me) it followed that the GM was deciding who is more likely to win or lose a fight between two players. I felt like the disconnect in the discussion was a result of friction between two points of view: on the one hand, that fiction "exists" in some platonic state to be uncovered by the questions of the GM -- which would mean that the "fiction" and not the GM is determining which player has an advantage; or, on the other hand, that the GM at least influences (if not outright creates) the fiction and, therefore, personally determines who has an advantage. <br/><br/>I don't particularly want to get into that Dungeon World discussion again -- that dead horse was soundly beaten -- but, I think unpacking the "who is really making the fiction?" question is useful when talking about the relationship between fiction and mechanics. It seems like there is a tendancy to say something like, "if you are so worried that the GM isn't fair, then maybe you should get another GM," or "just trust the other players and have a good time," and that's all well and good, but I feel like there are cases where the problem isn't a lack of trust, but rather that the GM (or somebody) MUST make fictional decisions which have mechanical consequences that are more fair to one player (or group of players) and less fair to another -- even if that GM is the most fair being in the world -- and that seems to be a design problem that is worth considering. <br/><br/>For another concrete example, my group was playing Stars Without Number, and the creative Expert character kept doing really smart fun tricky things to get out of trouble and harm bad guys using his skill rolls. The Fighter Space Marine character noticed that the Fighter niche thing "fighting" was a) much more likely to fail and b) much more likely to get him killed because the mechanics of fighting -- in that game -- are different from the mechanics of skill rolls. So, simply because of the way the rules worked, the Fighter character felt like he was at a disadvantage to contribute to the game. (We ended up switching to a hack of Lady Blackbird to finish the campaign). In retrospect, I could have been less willing to roll with the stuff that the Expert was trying to do or made the consequences of failure more dire in order to enforce greater balance and allow everyone to have similar risk and similar spotlights -- but that just means that the GM is turning the difficulty dials with fiction and that the rules are, as discussed upthread, secondary. Thinking about this kind of thing is worthwhile for the reasons also mentioned upthread.                            </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_407238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407238/#Comment_407238" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T15:12:55+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  3:12PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two quibbles.  First, I do not agree that there is such a "tendency" in any real sense.  I'm sure people have said  that sort of thing, it's IMO a sort of lazy response that gets applied to a lot of situations, but in the realms of design theory the issue of who and what controls the fiction has been explicitly explored.  All the games that disperse or distribute  that Authority over the fiction have been the result.  I do not see that the question has been left unasked.<br/><br/>Second, it does not seem to me that you have established a case where a decision was "unfair".  The fact that one party or another may be disadvantaged does not make a thing unfair automatically; unfairness implies some sort of partiality or injustice.  It seems to me entirely reasonable that concerns arising from the fiction may be more beneficial to one side than the other, and it is only because that fiction is in the power of a GM that makes it appear to be personal.

His point of contention is that most people believe the donut doesn't have a hole in it, but it really does.<br/><br/>The point to this whole conversation seems to be an attempt on Callan's part to shift peoples' point of view from "Mother-May-I is a thing that we can use to have fun and fill the donut hole" to "Mother-May-I is a negative result of a lack of complete game rules and is therefore an unacceptable solution." <br/><br/>I believe this is why Callan is reluctant to be forthright about the whole thing - because he knows that it is incredibly difficult to change someone's perspective by just saying it straight up - they have to go on a "journey of enlightenment" and figure it out for themselves almost. My neighbor is the same way - he doesn't want to just say it, he has to spend a half hour describing it in hopes that you'll come to appreciate what he's saying and ease into understanding. If he just said it straight up, it's too easy for me to respond with "Sorry, don't agree, end of conversation." so he draws it out and walks me through it, hoping for me to have an "Ahah!" moment. So, by the same merit, Callan can't just say "I'm trying to convince you to change your perspective" because that'll get him no where. To him, MMI is badwrongfun, but he can't say it that way otherwise people will stop listening. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the differentiation seems to be a personal and somewhat arbitrary thing to me. If one believes that MMI is a viable solution and not a lack of a solution, then from Callan's point of view, they're advocating that these games are whole and complete, which perpetuates the myth that he's trying to bust. Only when one realizes that MMI is actually a symptom of a problem and not a solution have they "seen past" the myth to actually behold the truth. <br/><br/>If I'm wrong, I invite Callan to clarify to the best of his ability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

I like that there is an acknowledgment of the mother-may-I-donut-guitar-hole issue. I'm on board with Callan's observation that many people don't ever recognize the issue is there. However, I don't see why we MUST go so far as to deem it a flaw. I think awareness is the important thing: because with awareness we can use it, manipulate it, avoid it, embrace it, or whatever in future designs. And, we can talk about how it affects existing games.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407421/#Comment_407421" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T16:03:14+00:00" title="February 26, 2013  4:03PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ultimately, the differentiation seems to be a personal and somewhat arbitrary thing to me.

I see what you're saying about it being a symptom of a problem, and if viewed in that light, it it's hard to simultaneously see it as a solution. On the other hand, MMI is basically the norm for traditional RPGs and people have been having a blast with D&amp;D for the past 40 years. How problematic can it really be? \n<blockquote><br/>Or do you mean a solution for you as a designer, not for the people who will play the game?<br/></blockquote>\nThe point for the designer is provide a solution to the player. The player's problem is the designers problem. If MMI is the designer's solution, then it's also theoretically the player's solution.\n<blockquote>But you call it a solution, Zach? What are you saying it's a solution to?</blockquote>\nWhat I understood the problem to be, which is "most RPGs do not spell out a proper method for determining which vision of the fiction is true or when the fiction prompts the use of mechanics".<br/><br/>That solution to "How do we know what the true fiction is and when do employ mechanics?" is "Speak fiction that the GM sympathizes with".\n<blockquote><br/>I think MMI/GM sympathy is passing on a problem to the users...it's just giving people a big problem ... I'd say it's not a solution at all but a mind numbing problem...</blockquote>\nThere it is! That's the root of this conversation.

How problematic can it really be? </blockquote>\nI could go through a series of social dissonances, point at accounts like in the forge's GNS essays where uncontestably boring sessions a week latter the memory is rewritten to awesome. But I'll skip that.<br/><br/>Okay, if people have had a blast with D&amp;D for 40 years, why do we need any other RPG's then? Why write new ones?<br/><br/>Further, if there are two lord of the rings games and one is 95% hole and 5% game, which is to say 'fiction is king', then they will both play pretty much the same. That 5% of game is too tiny, too much clinging on for dear life, to actually change play. Play just chugs along the same in each of them. Indeed, even if it's other settings or genres, if it's a 95% hole game, they all pretty much play exactly the same, regardless of setting or genre. Hit me up with play accounts if you've got an account of a game that was really different from regular play, but still let fiction be king.<br/><br/>At the very least, let's not put the hole front and center. Because it's been done many, many, many times before. That ground has been well covered! Why do it again? I'd love you to get my reasons about it, but at the very least the repetition reason is pretty clear.\n<blockquote>The point for the designer is provide a solution to the player. The player's problem is the designers problem. If MMI is the designer's solution, then it's also theoretically the player's solution.</blockquote>\nOkay, it's my turn to be confused! It sounds like circular logic? The designer provides a solution to the player, who's problem that needs a solution is...the designers problem? How does the player have the designers problem?\n<blockquote>That solution to "How do we know what the true fiction is and when do employ mechanics?" is "Speak fiction that the GM sympathizes with".</blockquote>\nThat problem is one you caused yourself by involving fiction - one could just write a boardgame, after all. This fiction problem doesn't have to be there - it's not providing a solution when you built in the problem to begin with.<br/><br/>As I said before, small, carefully placed doses of a hole/absence that fit to theme are interesting.<br/><br/>I guess it depends on at what point you think a certaint amount of hole actually interacts with the rules that are present in an interesting fashion and at what size the hole has to get before it's just a lack of content/been done many times before and not something that interacts with the rules in any interesting way.<br/><br/>At the very least, if you've written a 95% hole/5% game RPG before, why not write a 90% game, 10% hole game? Just to see the difference? I think some games like capes, 3:16, escape from tentacle city and Spione (to give a few examples) are mostly 90% rules, 10% GM sympathy. It's being done already.<br/><br/>Also if you want to talk of social dissonances, I think writing or running one will lead to a series of contrasting impressions against ones experience of 'fiction is king' games that will talk much louder than I can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407471/#Comment_407471" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T04:12:54+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  4:12AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2013 4:15AM by Deliverator.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops neverminnd sorry                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407472/#Comment_407472" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T04:34:37+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  4:34AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isn't <i>the problem</i> telling the players how to figure out if and when the can of peaches gets picked up?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407473/#Comment_407473" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T04:53:10+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  4:53AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In practice, the interaction among players &amp; GM, in-game fiction, and rules-text is more complicated than the GM-chokepoint that I think Callan is suggesting.

Archipelago comes to mind immediately in this regard.</blockquote>\nI think this is a great point. <br/><br/>I agree that it can seem problematic when mechanical procedures are based on unregulated subjective fiction -- i.e. when the "crunchy" parts of the game (rules, procedures, tables, dice) are controlled by the "mushy" parts of the game (imagined fiction). The reason this appears problematic is because the crunchy parts become more or less illusory. Why even have rules, if ultimately they only function at the whim of a GM (or a consensus agreement)? Why not just skip the middle man and make everything fiat or agreement? I think the answer is that there is no reason not to make everything fiat or consensus. Moreover, in practice, that is pretty much what happens in many games -- the "rules" are simply guidelines to help the omnipotent decision makers apply their judgments in a more or less consistent way. And, though it seems problematic if you don't recognize what you are really doing (MotherMayI) it's a perfectly functional way to engage in collaborative storytelling. I have players who WANT to be rewarded for creative descriptions with a mechanical bonus to success. They would be annoyed if they COULDN'T speak fiction to seek GM sympathy. That's the game they choose to play . . . <br/><br/>There are other ways to do it of course. In games like Archipelago and Polaris, it's the other way around, the crunchy parts control the mushy parts. In games like 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars, the crunchy parts and the mushy parts don't really interact much at all. In games like Apocalypse World, the GM's fictional powers are limited (the GM can only make soft moves until a player either blows a roll or intentionally ignores imminent harm). In games like Lady Blackbird, the consequences to crunchy failure are mushy story stuff, so all the mechanics ever do is redirect the mushy story part in a different direction -- the sympathy issue isn't such a big deal.<br/><br/>So, Callan's donut hole doesn't strike me as a dangerous pitfall. It's just a thing to be aware of and to fiddle with.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407527/#Comment_407527" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T17:02:42+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  5:02PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I find interesting here is how the pendulum in game design has swung backwards in the last few years:<br/><br/>After a period of more formalist game design (e.g. Universalis, Capes), we've had a lot of interest by designers in more "Donut Hole" heavy design. Games like Apocalypse World and Fiasco intentionally have "unclear" rules built into them as a feature, using player judgement and/or consensus as a characteristic of their design. I think these new designs are built with an awareness of the "Donut Hole", however. The idea (whether it's true or not, that's debatable) is that the Donut Hole (or Mother May I) produces a tighter connection to the fiction, which some gamers strongly desire. Whatever makes you game feel like a board game? This is the opposite of that.<br/><br/>Maybe this is one reason Callan is posting about this now? I don't know.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing where the next swing of the pendulum takes us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407532/#Comment_407532" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T17:51:56+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  5:51PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait....I thought Universalis was a example of this situation since it's a game where there is no established method of play - creating that method is part of what the players do!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407534/#Comment_407534" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T18:31:40+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  6:31PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The perennial lurker speaks: I question the usefulness of the "Donut Hole" analogy now that it's meaning becomes clearer. Without being too pedantic, the Hole (or Mother May I) is still surrounded/constrained by the Doughnut (rules) which seems opposite to the consensus here. Might it be more useful to consider the "Rules" (a word heavily laden with Authority and Restriction) as a Platform - an even playing field; common ground on which to build? An understanding between members of a particular group to form a foundation for building the fiction upon.

Right now, I'm reminded of the story of the economist who, upon being told of an empirical contradiction to his pet nostrum, said something like, "Sure, it works fine in practice, but how will it work in theory?" (The other Forge approach, argument by game design, is also available, but I'm not demanding that).<br/><br/>Thinking about it just briefly, it seems that Callan's model is suggesting that games proceed via acts of persuasion, which as a rhetorician I can accept. But everyone who's taken a public speaking course knows that pathos--emotion, sympathy--is only one of Aristotle's three persuasive proofs. You all remember the other two: ethos (the credibility of the speaker) and logos (the use of reasoning, particularly that which relies on "commonplaces" or shared assumptions between speaker and hearer). I think one could definitely pursue a "rhetoric of role-playing" that focused on how players got others at the table to accept their contributions. But narrowing the operation of that rhetoric to "sympathy" alone seems mistaken to me; as Aristotle says, it is "but a small portion of [the] art." <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407675/#Comment_407675" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-01T08:27:41+00:00" title="March  1, 2013  8:27AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill_White: I don't think Callan is using "sympathy" in such a technical way -- as I read it, sympathy in this thread encompasses other forms of persuasion.

But if it's persuasion and influence, why call it sympathy? That's just special pleading to make the claim that role-playing is essentially arbitrary without actually arguing it. Because when we play, we agree to be bound by its rules--by some accounts, that's the very definition of "game"--and those rules will tend to bound off some forms of influence as being outside the rules. "Convince me to activate this mechanic," says the GM to me. If I say, "I'll give you $20 if you do," I'm cheating, right? How about if I say, "I'll be a fucking bitch for the rest of the game session if you don't"? What counts as legitimate persuasion in any given instance is bound up in the rules and the larger "system," and designers can definitely play with that. But we imagine that the GM (and in GM-less games, everyone at the table) is making judgments about the diegetic  plausibility of the claim "I do X," and it's that judgment that affects decisions about which mechanics to implement if any, not merely the exercise of interpersonal influence. <br/><br/>Maybe I missed it in the foregoing discussion, but where is there room for the fiction in the ideas of RPGs as pure interpersonal influence? Players' understandings of what's happening in-game matter as much as who's clamoring to be heard, et cetera, and so talking about "the person who controls the fiction" is kind of begging the question. Callan's example demonstrates that: the GM didn't know that "following the left-hand wall" is a tried-and-true maze-solving strategy. So his reaction to Callan's I-do-X assertion seemed to have been skepticism, not because he disliked Callan or whatever, but because he couldn't see how it would work in the fiction. If Callan had demonstrated the empirical verity of his claim--by showing how with Legos or referring to some authority on labyrinths, for example--you can say, "Oh, yeah, see, he's exercising interpersonal influence," but I'm not sure how far that gets you. The (player's understanding of the) fiction still exerts its effect.<br/><br/>Notice that I'm not saying that players don't influence each other; they absolutely do. But part of the medium through which that influence is exercised is the fiction. And there are people who "play the table" rather than playing the game, so Callan is not wrong to observe that it's a thing. But it's not the only thing, and taken to a ludicrous extreme it's either cheating or being a spoilsport.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not arguing for the independent existence of the fiction outside of the players' understandings--it is indeed imaginary. But it does "act" upon the players' judgments, a joint creation that, if I am bound by the rules of the game, I will treat as having a real impact on what can happen next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407707/#Comment_407707" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-01T13:23:58+00:00" title="March  1, 2013  1:23PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Bill.

You are analyzing whether there is a "proper" way to influence the GM (bribery falling on the improper side in your estimation). But, that's not the issue. Callan's argument (as I understand it) is that it doesn't matter if the fiction is created by the most ethical GM in the world or even if it's created by happy joint consensus -- there is still a problem. The problem is that when fiction triggers the mechanics, it means that the mechanics are secondary at best, empty at worst, and that the game is, therefore, incomplete.  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407710/#Comment_407710" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-01T13:39:42+00:00" title="March  1, 2013  1:39PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2013 1:39PM by AMBayard.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh -- and, I don't know why he used the term sympathy.

You have used the word "sympathy" as a placeholder for that idea.

You'd certainly get no argument from me. But I don't think it's ineffable--that "if you gotta ask, you ain't never gonna know." I've always held that by examining what happens when we play, we can learn how to play better. What I hear Callan saying is that because you can never get away from the fact that role-playing requires human beings to communicate with each other, the whole thing is fundamentally inexplicable, or something. But then he says stuff like this:\n<blockquote>Anyone think groups are incapable of jamming with fiction, so it's all just arbitrary?<br/><br/>I mean, I've seen accounts of thrown together groups (usually not friends outside of the game) and from the account they weren't capable of jamming together. So I'd agree it does happen sometimes.</blockquote>\n. . . which suggests that what he's concerned with is simply the wondrousness of human communication. It is a complex thing, to be sure.<br/><br/>So let me see if I can reconstruct what I think Callan's argument is (or, actually, mostly AMBayard's cogent recapitulation of it), and people can correct me where I'm wrong.\n<ol>\n<li> The rules of the game can never specify with 100% certainty the circumstances under which they apply.<br/></li><li> Therefore, the application of those rules requires human interpretation.<br/></li><li> Since human interpretation is required, \n<ul>\n<li> the fiction is ultimately a product of someone at the table having to make a decision, and<br/> </li><li> it works better the more mutual experiences and common assumptions (i.e., "sympathy") the players share.</li></ul>\n</li><li> Since someone has to make a decision to produce the fiction, there can be problems, especially \n<ul>\n<li> when it's unclear who has "the right" to make that decision, or<br/> </li><li> when the fiction doesn't lend itself to an obvious answer, particularly if in-game stakes are high.</li></ul>\n</li><li> Since there can be problems with human interpretation of the rules, or uncertainty about the circumstances of their application, <b>none of the rules matter</b>.<br/></li><li> Since none of the rules matter, all role-playing boils down to is the exercise of interpersonal influence without regard to "the fiction" (which is ironically thus doubly imaginary).<br/></li></ol>\nI think I'm right there with you up until about point 5.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407777/#Comment_407777" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-02T04:41:09+00:00" title="March  2, 2013  4:41AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2013 4:46AM by summerdown.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just going to delurk again in the hope of checking my understanding. I think this is the argument:<br/><br/>1. The rules of <b>some</b> games do not specify how they are applied.<br/>2. To fix this, groups often use GM fiat or some variation of houseruled authority.<br/>3. However, this is a patch over the fact the rules themselves are missing an explanation of what to do here.<br/>4. Because of this, many games feel the same ... they end up in practice 5% rules interpreted by 95% social interaction.<br/>5. One result of this is the dissonance some people have historically felt about not getting the play they want.<br/>6. Some people like the solution they have ended up with (eg GM fiat). But even liking it doesn't mean the rules didn't have a hole in them.<br/>7. This is not true of all games, though (eg 3:16).<br/>8.

We've been talking "GM fiat vs Rules" but for 'nigh on forty year' now we've been told the Rules are really just guidelines. Now, it's my impression from various forums (ahem) and YouTube vids that not all gamers are meek, submissive types; that "GM as God" mode just don't cut it no mo'. Some gamers are downright bull-headed. So, how does anyone actually play the darn things without it breaking up in a wraslin' match?<br/>  Expectations.<br/>  The notion of commonality in setting, genre, play style, etc. (I know it has already been argued that this is part of the problem but if a player can't/won't buy into the premise that Monopoly is about buying properties and making money then that player should find another game and let the Donny Trumps have their fun. Don't look to the Rules to fix that).<br/>  Players come to the table with the Expectation that the Rules are there to be followed (somewhat). <br/>  We Expect a certain amount of GM fiat when the Rules fail the game/fiction/premise/character vision (or other per-conceived notions).<br/>  We also expect a commonality of sense, what I will call "Common Sense" (Trademarked biffboff  Incorporated, All Rights Reserved); at least in regards to the game world, setting, fiction, etc presented.<br/>  Furthermore, we Expect common courtesy at the table: The W. Wheaton "Don't be a dick" catch-phrase.

The rules for moving around squares in D&amp;D 3/4 are very chess like and emperic. But in the same game, the rules for height advantage - how high do you have to be? A big shrug from the ruleset (as far as I can recall) - it's a 'hole like' rule. You have both 'chess like' rules and 'hole like' rules in the same book. 3:16 and Capes have both chess like and hole like rules in them. Most traditional RPG's have a massively high amount of hole like rules in them (or even just no rules on things at all).<br/><br/>Bill's list apply to 'hole like' rules quite accurately as far as I can tell. His <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> comes from where the game designer didn't really understand to put in some chess like rules on who gets the final say, so as to stop the hole like rules from dead ending game play.<br/><br/>On <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>, in regard to 'hole like' rules only (NOT all the rules/not chess like rules as well), you just have to stop thinking the height advantage rules somehow determine height advantage. It's true, they don't matter in regard to that, only the person who has the final say AND the influence others have upon him/her, matters. Yet the 'move X number of squares' rules do matter in determining movement.<br/><br/>I'm thinking the confusion comes because Bill treat's 'hole like' rules as the only type you have in a (traditional) RPG (and given the influence of the 'golden rule', that might be a fair assessment actually). So I'd guess he thinks I'm saying ALL rules are hole types and I'm only refering to them. And so the dissonance on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>.<br/><br/>Or the short version; Bill, you've covered 'hole like' rules really well! Thanks for that well laid out point form! I'm tempted to copy it for my records! But you haven't meantioned chess like rules?<br/><br/>edit: Structure note: I didn't mean my numbers with hash in front of them to come up as links. The forum did that.<br/><br/><br/><b>Summerdown</b>, basically yes except on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a>, 3:16 has a small amount (like 10%) of 'hole like' rules, and it has final say rules in regards to them. 'hole like' rules are interesting when used sparingly in service to a theme and include a final say rule. So <a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a> is imagine the variety of games of games that could be produced if more people used 'hole like' rules sparingly and included final say rules with them.<br/><br/><br/>I'm not sure I've added much controversy there, as Zach expects? Or have I? 'Chess like' and 'Hole like' rules in the one RPG? Even in traditional RPG, no less! Blimey!? Nah, seems more a boring statement of fact from me than controversy!<br/><br/><br/><b>Biffboff</b>, as I said, when the final say isn't assigned, it's up for grabs (generally following social hierarchy, as Matrix Gamer cannily observes in the thread I linked to earlier). It may even shift around during the time at the table. <br/><br/>To those who are used to subtely manouvering to obtain the final say, it probably sounds like 'cajoling and wheedling' because it does ignore such manouvering entirely and basically makes it stop happening at the gaming table.<br/><br/>Depends - do you like the 'other factors' you've vaguely refered to? If so, okay, you like them. But in terms of this idea, if 'other factors'==manouvering, well manouvering is getting the cut. But really, if anyone likes manouvering for the final say, there's a ton of traditional RPG's out there that support that in spades already. So it's not like it's been eliminated as an option if anyone digs that sort of thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407823/#Comment_407823" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-02T17:59:27+00:00" title="March  2, 2013  5:59PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Callan,  can you tell me why it matters whether a game says who has the final say if the play is subject to sympathetic rulings?

I was creating the game, AND playing it, something no other game, excepting soulless computer games, had allowed. "<br/>  From R. Nixon his own self: "1 success = 1 fact or 1 die<br/>When a player wins a Test, he is left with a number of successes. For each of these successes, he can state one discrete fact about his character's success, or turn the success into a bonus die for a related action. (This action is normally the character's next action. However, it does not necessarily have to be.) The player cannot state irrelevant facts - facts concerning something besides his action - and success in the action is assumed unless the player states otherwise."<br/><br/>  I'm sure you'll find holes in that chess board and call it a "self-replicating sousaphone with a dice fetish" but as for me - I'm ordering the side of bacon AND sausage.

You've yet to determine who you are to be sympathetic <i>to</i>. I remember in my teenage years of gaming there could be quite some argument over this or that. Even in adult years, with game texts which don't really assign (merely imply) the final say, those arguments simply exist in a more subtle form. It ends up a game of social manouvering around who gets final say which has to be resolved before you can actually play/get to the sympathy part. It depends - with some groups there might be very little manouvering to pin down the final say role (though that can have side effects which I wont go into now), so little it might seem it doesn't exist. So that's why it might not seem an issue.<br/><br/><br/>JDCorley,\n<blockquote>Even if my best friend doesn't have to cajole/wheedle/manipulate me in some negative way to get what he wants in the game, he's going to get what he wants more than a stranger will because my best friend and I see eye to eye on a lot of things (otherwise we might not be such good friends).</blockquote>\nThat's an apt observation for the thread! A built up sympathy (and I'll note, a sympathy built up on someone who's a friend outside of gaming as well)\n<blockquote>I've even been in games with my best friend where he wants to do something, I (as the GM or GM-like figure) think it sounds reasonable, but the system keeps it from happening.

Perhaps an example of a rule structure that stops sympathy from totally controlling the related aspect of gameplay (in otherwords, it's a high percentage of rules to the game, not just 5% rules). And in doing so introduces something new to play, whereas before sympathy would have done what it usually does. And that being a possitive thing/a good feeling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407946/#Comment_407946" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T06:51:23+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  6:51AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If a rule reads: "during combat, when one character is striking another with an advantage of height, the striking character gets a bonus of +1, +2 or +3, depending on the significance of the advantage; the character with the blue feather decides."

The first hole is whether you have height advantage or not? Who knows? And there is no designation of who gets the final say on that. The second hole is, if the first hole is somehow resolved (who knows how?) whether you get a +1 to +3 bonus. This does have a final say built into it though, assuming there is only one official blue feather (AND it's been assigned to someone prior to the moment). So IF you can get to that point (past the prior hole that has no final say), then it's fairly cut and dried sympathy with the blue feather holder (I'll note I say 'GM' in GM sympathy to simplify the concept. The final say can be assigned by the text to someone else, exactly like your example)<br/><br/>Short version: Definately hole-like.<br/><br/><br/>Vernon, it depends. In some teen groups, the GM or someone will know another player is cheating at their rolls and...just not do anything about it. So when it comes to arguing with the final say, they obviously don't do anything about it either.<br/><br/>Mostly the GM, having found a creative outlet that they find they are very attached to, will put up with this crap and not enforce the final say, simply to keep the players. Often making this compromise over stuff they don't care about in the game (like maybe whether someone gets height advantage). Which often just backfires as the players eventually take advantage of a non enforced final say to shout down the GM's creations at some point, defeating the whole point. Never mind that sometimes the GM's creations are absolutely nothing the players signed up for - ie, the GM's used the final say to make, say, the robotech RPG to be about driving around in a jeep in the desert for ages, not doing much else (no mecha combat, that's for sure), or to make vampire about playing out the lives of living dollies. Two actual accounts I can recall. Of course the game text just encourages such baits and switches telling the GM he's in charge in a global sense.<br/><br/>Basically that's the result of putting holes in all over the place indiscriminantly (like, for example, height advantage, if you're game is about the lonelyness of orphans or something) - they serve no creative theme, so the GM doesn't defend the final say in regard to them in order to keep the players when the creative stuff he's really interested in comes up. But then when that stuff comes up, the final say has been eroded away and the players simply argue and bicker for position when the creative stuff does come up, trying to undermine the edge of the creativities final say simply for a mechanistic edge.<br/><br/>That or the GM actually tells people they can stop playing if they wish to start an argument over ... height advantage.<br/><br/>It's all as much a fascinating puzzle like a car accident is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408045/#Comment_408045" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T16:12:30+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  4:12PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>JD<br/><br/>What ways did rules get in the way of your trying to let the player get it?

When the rules in Chess say "a player's turn ends when they take their hand off the piece", the two players still need to agree when this has in fact happened.  "You let go!"  "No I didn't!" will mess up Chess just as much as "I don't have to roll to climb the stairs!" "Yes you do!" messes up an RPG.  Every shared activity, even ordering a pizza, has its MotherMayI component.  So the idea that rules will directly lead to game actions without player assent is completely out the window.  <br/><br/>3) Given <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, I'd like to point out that games use a variety of techniques to elicit that assent.  Off the top of my head, I can think of "define it precisely", "show why it's functional", "provide procedures for dispute resolution".  Most non-RPG games seem to go with precise definition, letting functionality be demonstrated in play (i.e. "this game works and is fun when we use the rules").  If there's one way in which RPGs differ on this front, it's in the difficulties of applying precise definition to spoken fiction, and the consequent reliance on (1) eliciting buy-in with various schemas and spins and examples, and (2) providing troubleshooting assistance in the form of endless advice and optional procedures.<br/><br/>4) I am not a huge fan of spin and advice.  Fortunately, we've seen some good techniques for producing rules-based assent with a minimum of player/GM subjectivity.  Take for example the Apocalypse World move "Seduce/Manipulate", which has the following features:<br/>- a rule states "When you try to seduce or manipulate someone, roll 2d6 + Hot."<br/>- another rule states "to make the roll, you must take the in-fiction action"<br/>- another rule states "to take the in-fiction action, you must make the roll"<br/>- success on the roll guarantees you good, useful outcomes<br/>- failure on the roll is likely to produce a fun and entertaining development for the table<br/>- there are certain things the GM can't do to the character, ever, unless such a roll is made<br/><br/>Accordingly, when a player wants to seduce an NPC, who's going to say "no, I don't assent to that"?  Usually, everyone at the table has some reason to want the seduction attempt to happen.<br/><br/>If the GM doesn't like the idea of this NPC being seduced, they can certainly go outside the game to lobby for that, just as a player in Chess can lobby against a move on out-of-game grounds like "we played that way last time" or "it'll be over too fast".  But that's not a hole in the game.  <br/><br/>If the GM simply says, "No, you can't roll," then they are explicitly breaking the first rule above, the one that tells the player, "when you try to seduce, roll".  Similarly, if the player tries to seduce someone who's in a coma, just because that <i>technically</i> falls within the bounds of the most immediate formal rules, that's just bad behavior that I can't lay at the design's doorstep.<br/><br/>5) No, Apocalypse World isn't <i>actually</i> like Chess, and yes, AW offers more potential room for reasonable disagreement regarding things like which NPCs it's fictionally plausible to seduce when.  Please forgive any exaggeration in my prior point.  My real point here is that AW's approach turns the link between the Seduce/Manipulate rules and player behavior into a <i>relative</i> no-brainer at a <i>relatively</i> good rate, eliciting a <i>relatively</i> high rate of automatic assent from all participants.  Relative, that is, to (e.g.) a D&amp;D climb check, whose viability and difficulty and relevance and success/failure outcomes can be debated endlessly and really demand an explicit player "final say" rather than an implicit one.<br/><br/>So, if we can move a little bit away from D&amp;D skills, and a little closer to Chess, who's to say we can't go even a little farther, with rules that are more precise, and convincing, and thorough?<br/><br/>In other words, in terms of your original A/B formulation, I don't see it as either "A: no hole" or "B: hole", but rather as a continuum between "A: small hole" and "B: huge hole".  I agree with your advice against treating B like A in RPG design, but with the caveat that one has options to move toward A if one so desires.<br/><br/>Perhaps you were on board with that from the start.

Whether someone has taken their fingers off the chess piece is pretty much an emperical measurement. Where as trying to judge someones responce to spoken fiction is like trying to judge if someone has imagined the right way. As if they could imagine wrong. So the chess example and the spoken fiction example really are different. The chess example rests on certain physical events actually happening. If the person never takes their fingers off the piece but they both agree he did take his fingers off - clearly that doesn't make sense! It's not just about getting agreement - actual physical events have to happen. As opposed to spoken fiction where people basically go along with their own personal notions of what was spoken, if they agree to go along with it.<br/><br/>It seems, particularly in regard to your point 5, you attribute a 'going along with it agreement' even where I'd identify it as a chess like rule where certain physical events are required to have happened (not just agreement). That's why you're seeing it as a small hole/big hole continuum, because you treat my 'physical events need to have occured' as more 'we just need assent around the table'. To you, it just seems a matter of how much assent, large or small.<br/><br/>So I think your assigning the praise for the games continued smooth play to hole-like rules/going along with it agreement rules, when really it's a result of chess like rules. Calling the coma victim seduction bad behaviour is an indicator of a shift away from chess like rules, rather than toward them. <br/><br/>And with it, away from the type of rules that actually grant that smooth play. If the seduction ability is simply available (without a GM fiat option built in, or without a group fiat option built in) then really it's as available as the fingers are on the chess piece. It's not bad behaviour, unless you favour hole-like design.<br/><br/><br/>As a bit of a side topic: Whether the AW text says this or not, the following\n<blockquote>- another rule states "to make the roll, you must take the in-fiction action"<br/>- another rule states "to take the in-fiction action, you must make the roll"</blockquote>\nAre in direct contradiction to each other, neither allowing the other to happen? It's like saying A: you can't take the dagger out of the box until the box's lid is opened and B: You can't open the lid of the box until you take the dagger out. What might seem affirming, complimentry rules are actually utterly contradictory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408215/#Comment_408215" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T21:25:53+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  9:25PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2013 9:31PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>I see a few steps here:</b><br/>1) It's determined what moves I can make throughout play.<br/>2) It's determined what moves I can make right now.<br/>3) I make one of those moves.

You can't trap us in an endless loop that way. The effect of those two statements is to orient us to the simultaneity and inseparability of the in-game (fictional) action and the game-mechanical (non-fictional) procedure. "So to get past the guard, I have to <i>both</i> (a) say how I'm sneaking past him and (b) roll my Defy Danger." By making them inseparable, you're trying to avoid circumstances in which either a piece of the fiction is given insufficient game-mechanical weight (thus rendering it susceptible to purely "table-level" interpersonal dynamics, or else what John Tynes calls "Drama"), or in which a bit of dice-rolling or card-drawing is disconnected from the fiction (thus making the story-world less engaging or immersive).

I was coming from a background where the "Mother May I" model of play (hole-like rules) was *the* true and only way to play a game, so these concepts were pretty foreign.<br/><br/>But I could see how you could use rules to guide play in certain directions, to limit and expand various players' ability to make certain statements or choose certain options in the game. <br/><br/>So I approached my friends, who were complaining about "railroading GMs". I asked them, "So, let's design a game where the GM cannot railroad the players. Do you think that's an worthwhile goal?"<br/><br/>Worthwhile? We never got there. They thought about for a little while, and then, unanimously told me that this thing I was talking about was impossible, could never be done.<br/><br/>So the hole-like MMI culture certainly exists in the RPG world, in my opinion, and many players are unaware that other possibilities exist (even though, in retrospect, even the most traditional RPG often has a variety of more formal rules, whether the players are aware of them or not).<br/><br/>Using this understanding in design has broadened the scope of existing games dramatically, in my opinion, and that's a wonderful thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408322/#Comment_408322" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T17:23:24+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  5:23PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Bill, I'd be curious to hear your take on the larger issue here.

A foot race? The goal is get from point A to point B, but we can't take shortcuts across the track and we can't use a bicycle, even though that would mean getting to point B faster. Even make-believe games could be more efficient by providing each player with a script, he says.<br/><br/>So the rules specify the conditions under which they pertain, and players in general make a good-faith effort to apply them under those conditions, having agreed to abide by the restrictions the game imposes on them. The players who don't do that, according to Suits, are either cheaters (who care about winning, but not about following the rules) or spoilsports (who don't care about the game at all). There's not a lot you can do to police those motivations, as it turns out--and in some cases, one person's cheating is another person's how you play the game. My friend J. Tuomas Harviainen talks about role-playing games as information systems, and notes (in a piece that appeared in <i>Simulation &amp; Games</i> maybe last year or the one before) that the fact that some players regard taking OOC info into character decision-making as anathema and others don't is luckily masked by the concomitant fact that players don't have to reveal their motivations for their decisions, they just have to decide. Thus it's possible for people with different philosophies of play to have a reasonable expectation of being able to play together successfully--although, as the Forge conception of Creative Agenda makes clear, sometime those clashes can produce dysfunctional or unsatisfying play.<br/><br/>I recently played Kevin Allen Jr.'s <i>Trouble for Hire</i>, which is GMless and does a very nice job of assigning responsibilities for collaboratively creating a story, shifting those responsibilities around each turn and keeping track of each player's ability to influence or contest the course of events with what seemed to be a precisely calibrated story-point economy. Delightful! And while each player's performance was certainly directed at the other players, to persuade them that his contribution was valid in terms of the rules, it was also directed at creating a satisfying fiction under the constraints that he'd been given ("This turn, you contribute by showing how the environment helps or hinders the hero, or by adding background description. You get bonus points as usual by using the motifs introduced earlier in the game"). And there was even room for role-playing.<br/><br/>The main contribution of what I'm going to call the Forge tradition is the idea that game mechanics can be used to provide incentives to participate in an RPG in ways that produce an emergent story. There are other traditions, of course, ones that focus on procedures and orientations to play that create immersive experiences. But both manage to get a grip on how to structure player-player (player-GM) interaction by orienting them toward the fiction. I suppose there's something to be gained from focusing on what I call "table-level" dynamics, but honestly that sort of thing reminds me of <i>Diplomacy</i>, which I can never play without experiencing existential-level angst over my masculinity and fitness as a human being.\n<blockquote>I long for the RPG whose rulebook is boardgame-sized (i.e. a few pages) because "how to use it to cover what actually comes up in play" doesn't require truckloads of explanation.</blockquote>\nThat stuff is out there, I think. It's what the jeepers and the structured freeform designers like Paul Tevis and Emily Care Boss and I want to say Jonathan Walton have been working toward or at least thinking about.

They're written for a specific audience familiar with certain conventions and methods. As a simple example, the rules never explain what a GM is, or that each player should pick one of the characters to play, *except* for the GM. The text gives no guidance on how long the game will take, or how to end it, or what kind of narrative authority the players have, or how to adjudicate specific mechanical questions, etc., etc.<br/><br/>I do feel like we're getting close to making games that can work "out of the box". But I don't think we're there yet. (Of course, many of the games which are popular lately are quite the opposite, like Apocalypse World -- they resemble traditional RPGs far more than something boardgame-like, so that may not be "in fashion" right now.)<br/><br/>I haven't read the printed rules, but I would think some games (like Happy Birthday, Robot) fit this criteria; they just don't feel like RPGs to everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408394/#Comment_408394" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T15:17:51+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  3:17PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2013 3:32PM by Callan_S.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>It might be me quibbling, but your examples still seem to rest mostly on assent. I'll pitch a contrasting example:<br/><br/>1. The rules say to roll a 1D6, and a 6 happens to come up. We agree it's a 6 pretty much because it IS a 6.<br/><br/>2. The rules say the GM is to imagine how, in the fiction, an imaginary thrown 6 sided dice will come up. He says it comes up as a 6. As it happens, everyone decides to nod and go along with this. But that's pretty much just going along with what he says.<br/><br/>As said, I might be quibbling and maybe it doesn't need to be noted, but I think the contrast is interesting anyway.<br/><br/>On your better defined fiction first, it basically shifts the final say to everyone voting. The GM's role is kind of redundant since he can be punted out of the final say position by even one person disagreeing and so enacting the vote mechanic.<br/><br/>I think the key elements to a hole are that the player wants some rules to be enacted, but there is no mechanical procedure. There's only a gap in the rules on that, an absence - a hole. At best someone has the final say over whether those rules get enacted or not.<br/><br/>Your well defined rules first doesn't seem to really address the topic - okay, the player wants X rules to be enacted? Sure, maybe you are making him speak new fictions, but it doesn't resolve who's in charge of whether rule X is enacted? Indeed, even if who's in charge of enaction was made clear, it almost seems spiteful - okay, lets say the player spoke fiction that influences the GM to enact rule X. But bah-bow, another player spends a point to make him say it again? What's the point of that except to piss in his wheaties and not get rule X enacted? It seems off topic, at least?<br/><br/><br/>Bill,<br/>"It's all just sympathy, so the mechanics don't really matter" is a really inaccurate summerisation of what I've talked about. <br/><br/>Some folk 'See' breaches of previously spoken fiction - and treat this as cheating just as much as someone who puts weights in their RL dice is cheating. They see spoken fiction as eminently policeable.<br/><br/>I don't - I just see their 'seeing' as a subjective reaction they have to the spoken fiction and their brains reaction, ie, the images that pop into their head, doesn't somehow trump the way someone else imagines things. Let alone grounds to call anyone else a cheat. Spoken fiction is at best a kind of music and it's a matter of whether you dig the beat or not. Not whether a fictional action is possible or not.<br/><br/>And I know I will be miss summerised by the earlier folk time and time again and will just have to shoulder that for the moment. Because they don't distinguish chess like rules and hole like rules, because to them all spoken fiction is just as policeable as chess like rules use is policeable (so they come to the conclusion I'm saying it's ALL just sympathy, since to them I seem to be refering to what is policeable, which is 'all of it')<br/><br/>At the very least, I think I can summerise your position reasonably accurately: That the spoken fiction is policeable - that some fictional actions 'just aren't possible' and that only a cheat or spoilsport would be trying to do them.<br/><br/>If I have summerised somewhat accurately, I'll present that as my argument for now. That I can outline the counter position so accurately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408408/#Comment_408408" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T18:06:16+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  6:06PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm just going to delurk again in the hope of checking my understanding.

It's what the jeepers and the structured freeform designers like Paul Tevis and Emily Care Boss and I want to say Jonathan Walton have been working toward or at least thinking about. And what about <i>Lady Blackbird</i>?</blockquote>Oh, yeah, there are definitely great short games out there!  It just seems to me that most of them, rather than solving the problems Callan's talking about, by using (e.g.) new structures or communication techniques, simply ignore them.  If I remember right, Jeep and Blackbird are bags of techniques you can use "whenever", and knowing when is kind of up to the skills of all participants.  (Which is of course another solution to Callan's quandary.)<br/><br/><i>Penny for My Thoughts</i> might be an exception.  I think you know exactly what rules you can and cannot use at every moment of play.  The only exception might be someone extending their turn to speak for longer than the group wants, but that might be nit-picking.<br/><br/>Callan, do you know this game?  Oh, also, <i>Swords Without Master!</i>  Passing the talking stick is remarkably tidy.<br/><br/>Bill, it sounds like <i>Trouble For Hire</i> might have similar virtues?  From your description, that sounds great!<br/><br/>As for the Bernard Suits stuff, I think the interesting question isn't whether not-on-board players can break a game, but whether the game can effectively get players on board.  And by "on board" I don't mean "pumped about the fictional premise", I mean "pumped about exploring that premise in a certain way".  If "when to invoke the mechanics" is fuzzy, I think that achievement is less likely, even given general good spirit from the players.<br/><br/>Digression re: table-level dynamics:<br/>I had a recent discussion with friends who were vehemently opposed to having their contributions judged by fellow players -- "Never show me the Love / Pity points you gave me in Kagematsu!" for instance.  Clearly, table-level design is a turn-off for some.  Personally, I love it.

I feel the GM is fairly toothless in the example, unable to enforce his artistic vision of a world and instead it can be overridden by a commitee pretty much for free (no points spent for it or anything). It reminds me of the position commercial artists are often in. But really the example has a final say, so I can't say it has the problems a system without a final say has.

Just play freeform if you intend alot of holes in your design, instead of trying to have the pretense of structure. None of the mechanics you write down will be worth much of a damn if you fill the design with a ton of indiscriminate holes, it just makes them all optional - so don't bother writing any down and go freeform.<br/><br/>Or just use a descrete few holes used in support of the games theme.<br/><br/>The whole 'others say no, not really' is just a way of maintaining the status quo where roleplay culture writes out rules, yet make them utterly optional because of the holes, and so really not much point in those rules existing at all (unless the person who gets the RPG just isn't bright enough to make up something like those optional rules if they so very much need some - I kind of doubt they are incapable of doing so). Even as some newer indie RPG's are giving up on this optional culture.<br/><br/>But I don't get summerised as saying to use a discrete number of arbitrary ruling points/holes. I get summerised as dismissing arbitrary points entirely?<br/><br/>There's a quote from an author I like who says he likes to argue for the moderate position - in that way he'll be left alone. Here I don't argue for an extreme of arbitrary=broken, nor do I support putting holes willy nilly through the game. I argue a moderate in between.

But if by "arbitrary" you mean "with no rationale behind it", then I don't think that's the case at all.

I was just summarizing the thread that has come before to help people who were getting caught up in unrelated tangents. (Specifically, people seemed to think you were saying that there is a distinction between "fiction first" games where the fiction is generated by a GM and "fiction first" games where the fiction is generated by consensus agreement. I was pointing out that the distinction doesn't matter. The source of the fiction in the "fiction first" games doesn't change the analysis.) I meant to provide a very short statement of the conflicting points of view in this thread without advocating for either. Acknowledging the positions without further detail is not the same as ignoring your arguments. That certainly wasn't my intention. This thread is filled with your arguments. I wouldn't be adding anything by repeating them. \n<blockquote>Fill the game full of holes (particularly without any final say) and you just end up making a freeform game that bogs itself down in pretend following of mechanics. Just play freeform if you intend alot of holes in your design, instead of trying to have the pretense of structure. None of the mechanics you write down will be worth much of a damn if you fill the design with a ton of indiscriminate holes, it just makes them all optional - so don't bother writing any down and go freeform.</blockquote>\nSee. There are some more of them. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>The whole 'others say no, not really' is just a way of maintaining the status quo where roleplay culture writes out rules, yet make them utterly optional because of the holes, and so really not much point in those rules existing at all (unless the person who gets the RPG just isn't bright enough to make up something like those optional rules if they so very much need some - I kind of doubt they are incapable of doing so). Even as some newer indie RPG's are giving up on this optional culture.</blockquote>\nJust because I identify that there is a position that opposes yours doesn't mean that I have maintained the status quo. There really is an opposing position as stated more fully upthread. I was just saying that it exists -- not that it is right or wrong.\n<blockquote>But I don't get summerised as saying to use a discrete number of arbitrary ruling points/holes. I get summerised as dismissing arbitrary points entirely?<br/><br/>There's a quote from an author I like who says he likes to argue for the moderate position - in that way he'll be left alone. Here I don't argue for an extreme of arbitrary=broken, nor do I support putting holes willy nilly through the game. I argue a moderate in between. And indeed, I have been left alone.</blockquote>\nFine. You don't think that games need to be scrubbed of all things "hole-like" and you can imagine a functional game that contain some "holes." You're not an extremist. I apologize if that was my implication. The fact that you have a moderate position on this subject, however, doesn't really change the underlying issue I was attempting to summarize . . . <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408760/#Comment_408760" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T14:41:31+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  2:41PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2013 2:44PM by AMBayard.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>If a game is "fiction first" whether by consensus or GM fiat or any other method, then the application of mechanics is arbitrary.

(For that matter, it's arbitrary no matter who creates the fiction). It doesn't matter how well defined the mechanics are. If the mechanics happen in response to fictional events that somebody just decides, then it's arbitrary. If "wisdom" is even involved in the decision about when the players must roll the dice, that means that it's arbitrary decision. <br/><br/>I think there may be an assumption that that when I write arbitrary, I'm implying "capricious" or "indifferent" -- or "without rationale." I don't mean to imply any of that. By arbitrary, I just mean that somebody is making a decision without reference to a governing rule -- they are making a decision on their own based on their own wisdom. I agree with Callan that arbitrary decision making is a HUGE part of MOST games. I'm just less sure than he is that there is anything wrong with that. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408761/#Comment_408761" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T14:48:25+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  2:48PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to make my own attempt at a "Callan S. post" here:<br/><br/>So we say "arbitrary" means making a decision on your own wisdom, without reference to a governing rule.<br/><br/>Does that mean that when we sit down to play a game of chess, and you decide to advance your king's pawn two squares, you've made an <i>arbitrary</i> decision?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408763/#Comment_408763" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T14:57:19+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  2:57PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think so.

"Callan thinks arbitrary=use in moderation" would be a good summery. But I get that the way you read me it seems like a correct summery is arbitrary=broken. So I shouldn't write as if it was a deliberate miss summerisation; my mistake on that. I could have just said I don't claim that summery. Anyway, overall it's still a matter in discussion.<br/><br/><br/>I think <b>David Berg's</b> poker example is good to highlight a hole system? Okay, why might you be raising? Because maybe you've card counted or seen through someones bluff and you know they hold X combination of cards but you hold an even better combination than them. So you raise.<br/><br/>Okay, it comes down to showing your cards, you show yours proudly, and go to take your winnings.<br/><br/>"Oh no", says the poker GM, "were not using that combination. The other player wins!"<br/><br/>And you find that you sat down to a version of poker with holes in it and whether your combination actually gets used wasn't stated by the text (and lets say it did assign the final say to the poker GM though, on whether it does).<br/><br/>This is what holes do - they stop you from having things you can bank on. The more holes, the less you can make plans because anything you might base your plans on might be removed latter.<br/><br/>And how fun is it to raise when you know your combination of cards just might be made moot?<br/><br/>A few discrete holes can be interesting - but alot just leads to player disempowerment (or atleast they give up on mechanics use as their empowerment)<br/><br/><br/><b>Paul_T</b>,<br/><br/>It's an interesting question. You have to realise there's a difference between<br/>A: Making arbitrary choices about what rules are even going to be used and<br/>B: When rules are being used and those rules present several options, arbitrarily choosing between them.<br/><br/>With the caveat that in chess you try and make choices that lead to you winning, yes, the B choice is arbitrary.<br/><br/>It's often the impression that B is acting 'acting pursuant to the rules' (which is true) that leads to a false sense that A is also 'acting pursuant to the rules'. That's why some people just declare for a roll to happen every so often - it keeps up the illusion everythings acting pursuant to the rules. Actually I have a link to an account of <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?622824-D-amp-D-5E-Rule-of-Three-4-17-2012&amp;p=15308663#post15308663" rel="nofollow">that</a>. I'll quote it here:\n<blockquote>A surprising number of people need a die roll to add authenticity to narration, even if there's no set DC and the DM is basically just gonna tell you that you succeed unless the die comes up really low. To be honest, I'm one of those people sometimes -- it's as if the trappings of mechanical support make it seem like you're actually doing something impartial, rather than just bullshitting.</blockquote>\nSo, in line with the caveats above about trying to win and choosing ONLY from the options the rules grant, yes, B: is an arbitrary decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408776/#Comment_408776" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T17:15:08+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  5:15PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2013 7:09PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Okay, it comes down to showing your cards, you show yours proudly, and go to take your winnings.<br/><br/>"Oh no", says the poker GM, "were not using that combination.

I think the key, though, in the poker example, isn't just that there's a hole, it's that there's a hole in the road to the goal.<br/><br/>Depending on what you take to be the goal of an RPG, some of the holes don't sabotage that in the way that uncertain hands would sabotage poker.  "I paid to boost my Far-Seeing stat, but the GM keeps setting adventures in crowded valleys" is a nuisance, and it does impact one's ability to plan (in this case, XP spends), but it isn't nearly the deal breaker that "a full house may or may not count" would be in poker.  Not that deal breakers don't exist in RPGs; they certainly do!

I read you originally, in wanting to distinguish between "chess-like" and "hole-like" rules, where "chess-like" means something like <i>algorithmic</i> (implying some degree of procedural certitude or specificity) and "hole-like" means something like <i>underdetermined</i>, as saying that this under-determination was somehow problematic, perhaps on principle, because it meant that whoever had to decide in the moment how to deal with whatever the rules didn't cover--specifically, whether they applied in a given instance--was either (a) susceptible to social-level pressures in his or her decision-making ("Shouldn't I get a Luck bonus on this roll? Pretty please?") or (b) able to substitute personal preferences or affect for more measured or objective judgment ("Ah, I don't want this to happen because that player is a pain in the neck--I'll tell him no"). Now I'm not sure anymore if you're saying that it's problematic, and "hole-like" seems to have morphed into sheer randomness, based on the poker example above. But maybe it's just a bad example.<br/><br/>The thing is, we knew about rules being underdetermined already; it's the basis for the distinction about task vs. conflict resolution, for example. I may have a 75% chance to Move Silently, but how many times do I have to do it before I'm past all the guards? In a task resolution system, the GM sets up the situation, and there's nothing stopping her from just making me keep rolling until I fail, because she wants me to get caught (or, conversely, allowing me to roll something else to avoid capture even when I blow my Move Silently and alert the guards--"You hear the guard approaching! Quick, roll Hide in Shadows to see if he doesn't notice you!"). In conflict resolution, we know that if I blow this roll, the guard wins and I lose--the consequences of which are set either when we explicitly set stakes beforehand, or when the GM "acts in the interests of" the guard following an NPC victory. Now that's not to say that we can't resolve the conflict between me and the guard using a task resolution system, but the rules as such don't pin down exactly what needs to happen before we can say who's won and who's lost. <br/><br/>Now, there are lots of different solutions to the problem of rules underdetermination. One is to add procedural specificity to the rules. Burning Wheel's "Let It Ride" rule is one such example--in fact, Burning Wheel strikes me as entirely geared toward addressing issues of GM whimsy by adding formal structures of play--in that it says the GM can't require multiple rolls of a single type to get past a guard, climb a wall, or what have you. But that doesn't solve the problem entirely, since the question of when it is permissible to make that roll falls into the realm of the underdetermined. However, we might imagine that the circumstances in which the GM would legitimately wish to say a proposed PC action is impermissible occur when there is a disconnect between the fiction in the GM's head and the one in the player's.<br/><br/>Other solutions therefore emerge not from the rules <i>per se</i> but from the GM's own artfulness. For example, the GM's own scrupulous adherence to the implicit procedures of play can help a lot. When Eero talks about his way of running D&amp;D, where he mercilessly consults the fiction in order to determine the consequences of PC actions, that's scrupulousness to the nth degree. Another thing that helps is the GM's painstaking attention to the interaction at the table, so that she is able to identify when she needs to clarify the fictional situation because it has hitherto been unclear to one or more players. The example I cite in my Knutepunkt article, where the player playing Rex Rich in "Rex Rich and the Warlord of Mars," is unclear about the source of a claim the GM is making, requiring time be spent at the table to clarify what's happening in the fiction (and what's happening at the table) is an example of why that's necessary.<br/><br/>So that's why I'm not terribly concerned about "hole-like rules" as a theoretical issue. Because we grapple with it all the time, in ways that are easier for me to understand and that lead me to what I think are better design solutions. Now, it's entirely possible, Callan, that you and I are in total agreement, but I honestly can't tell.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408827/#Comment_408827" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T09:36:37+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  9:36AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now I'm not sure anymore if you're saying that it's problematic, and "hole-like" seems to have morphed into sheer randomness, based on the poker example above.

He believes that a decision that is based on "the fiction" may as well be completely arbitrary, because "the fiction" is based on things people have said, which is just meaningless jibber-jabber to him because there's no enforcement mechanism. He thinks that the only things that matter are rules that an invisible observer could theoretically enforce.

For example, it's possible for two people to play a casual game of tennis without a referee, even though the players can't <i>force</i> each other to always be honest about what they saw when the ball lands near one of the boundary lines and they need to resolve whether the shot was in-bounds or out in order to determine the next game-state. It's also possible for an Apocalypse World GM to actually follow the Agenda, Principles, and Always-Says and therefore participate in an actual game, even though an unscrupulous person could make arbitrary and capricious decisions and <i>claim</i> they were basing them on "the fiction" if they were sitting in the same seat. Historically, some games were very wishy-washy about how to avoid slipping into arbitrary and capricious territory, which is why the approach taken in AW was rightly seen as innovative.<br/><br/>Callan's position isn't especially complicated. It only looks that way because people assume there's more depth behind his rhetorical tactics than there really is.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408830/#Comment_408830" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T10:41:29+00:00" title="March 12, 2013 10:41AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2013 10:42AM by Bill_White.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Callan believes that "the fiction" is meaningless nonsense.

Tuomas Harviainen's recent <i>Simulation &amp; Gaming</i> <a href="http://sag.sagepub.com/content/43/4/506.abstract" rel="nofollow">article</a>, "Ritualistic Games, Boundary Control, and Information Uncertainty," which is a really interesting take on what's happening among players and in their heads during play. One of Jiituomas's insights is that in many circumstances what's going on inside someone else's head is immaterial to another player's enjoyment of the game as long as it <i>appears</i> consistent with their expectations about what <i>should</i> be going on inside their head. For example, if I think it's important that you make decisions <i>as your character</i> rather than <i>as a player</i>, as long as whatever you offer is interpretable by me as character- rather than player-based, it doesn't break the game for you to actually metagame in that way a little bit. \n<blockquote>This article examines the information environment of ritual-like games. Using tools from library and information science and the cognitive study of religion, it shows that certain key phenomena in games can be modeled as patterns of information and thus examined to a deeper level than before. This is of particular use to game scholars wishing to understand the intricacies of the play experience and to educational simulation/game researchers wanting to develop more efficient role-play based learning. Of particular significance to these so-called liminal games is boundary control, a system of maintaining the necessary fictional reality within the magic circle. Its maintenance results from a shared need to preserve the game-reality intact, an understanding of what is relevant to play, and a heightened reliance on information sources within the game-space. Continual boundary control makes the play function as a self-referential system, where the activity becomes rewarding and meaningful to the players because of the very limitations it contains. This condition, along with the manipulation of uncertainty about information needs during play, is then used to explain processes that take place while being engrossed in/absorbed by playing a ritualistic game as well as in game-based learning in liminal environments.</blockquote>\nIt's actually pretty directly relevant to the issues in this thread.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408842/#Comment_408842" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T13:17:53+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  1:17PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a hard to swollow pill here - I'll start with a quote about <a href="http://rsbakker.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/three-readerly-illusions/" rel="nofollow">'Readerly Illusions'</a> (though I'm talking about 'Listener Illusions' more specifically.

Let\u2019s call this the Illusion of Semantic Objectivity. We seem to have a hardwired tendency to think of our reading experience as a kind of thing, and to use the logic of things to structure our subsequent reasoning about books and readings.</blockquote>\nI'll tease that out some more - by default, we tend to treat our reaction to fiction (written or spoken) as if our reaction was <i>actually</i> in the book or in the sound waves. By default, we don't think of it as 'our reaction', but instead 'that's what the book says/that's what they said!'<br/><br/>DanMaruschak basically spits the pill by saying I'm calling it all nonsense. He doesn't want to hear that it's his subjective reaction to spoken fiction and its obvious implication that a subjective reaction is no ground for calling anyone a cheat. Instead to him, I'm just calling it all nonsense.<br/><br/>But never mind what it is for now - just humour for awhile the idea it's all subjective reaction to prior spoken fiction. Then, to put in less glamourous terms, everything essentially is Bill White's 'pretty please'. You're just saying pretty please in a more convoluted way by making fiction which pleases the subjective reaction of the GM/person with final say. But my god, how would you police that? Well, you don't - not in a 'stick' sense. In a 'carrot' sense though, it's fun to try and speak fiction that fits the spoken fiction of others, which is fun for the GM to hear and so <i>pleases </i>him/her. It's fun to speak fiction that fits with other fiction! It might all be subjective reaction and unpoliceable, but people will attempt to speak fiction that fits with other spoken fiction, because that's fun! And <i>not</i> because of a fear someone might scream 'Cheat!' in their face.<br/><br/>Now, if you don't take that to be true, okay. But if you are talking about the idea of being able to detect someone cheating when it comes to subjective reaction, then you can't actually visualise the idea to begin with to reject it. Any 'rhetorical tactics' are the product of a strawman of someone elses invention.<br/><br/><br/>Bill,<br/><br/>Your conflict resolution vs task resolution is a good example. The thing is, if the GM can just just mercilessly consult the fiction, why isn't task resolution just fine by itself? I think you can see the benefits of conflict resolution. I think you can see the holes that let the GM make you roll stealth over and over if he wants you to fail and the holes that let him have you roll stealth again and again if he wants you to pass. And I think you can see that conflict resolution removes these holes, to a certain degree. Which is precisely what I'm talking about - to have fewer (and thematically placed) holes in the system.<br/><br/>But then you go into mercilessly consulting the fiction. If you want to design games with lots of holes and accepting the ramifications of that, okay. But you seem to be advocating conflict resolution but also saying there are no ramifications if the GM is just very, very particular in his scrutinising of the fiction (in which case why isn't pure task resolution fine?)?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408847/#Comment_408847" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T14:02:43+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  2:02PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, it seems fairly obvious that these "holes" Callan is talking about exist, are a real thing, etc. What's much more interesting to me, however, is discussing <i>where to put them</i> in design, and why.<br/><br/>Here's an example we might be able to use for the sake of argument:<br/><br/>You're playing D&amp;D, or some similar game, and you're the GM. You've got to "stat up" a monster. What are some different ways to do this?<br/><br/>In the "chess-like" design, your options are tightly constrained, and maybe you spend a budget of points to pick options off an existing list. It's easy to follow this procedure reliably (but whether it's fun or not, and whether its results work well or not, depends on the game's design, of course).<br/><br/>However, in a "hole-like" design, the GM can design the monster however he or she wants. Still, there's a big range within this "hole" depending on how the rest of the game works. Some hypothetical options:<br/><br/>1. You design the monster however you like, or not. Go!<br/><br/>This is tough, for obvious reasons, but some people will love it for the creative freedom it affords and praise your game endlessly. (This is along the lines of "I love D&amp;D because <i>you can do ANYTHING you want</i>!" A true selling point for some people.)<br/><br/>2. You design the monster however you like, but the game tells you that the thing you should do is make a monster which won't kill any PCs, but is tough enough to remove about 50% of their hit points.<br/><br/>Now it's still arbitrary, and the GM could very easily ignore these directives. But for the GM who buys into these directions, there is now a specific challenge, a specific goal to accomplish. The GM can aim for a certain level of success and measure her product relative to that benchmark. ("That monster took away 75% of their hit points. I'll have to make the next one weaker.")<br/><br/>The success of the monster design is now a matter of player skill/game mastery, which some people will fail and some people will really enjoy.<br/><br/>3. You design any monster you like, but the goal is to push on the characters' Issues/give them opportunities to hit their Keys/Beliefs. (Or maybe: design any monster you like, but your goal is to scare the *players* - look at their faces as you play and you'll see if you've succeeded!)<br/><br/>Once again, here we have a clear goal, something which the GM can attempt and succeed or fail. There is a "hole", but the game gives some guidance on how best to take advantage of the hole. Depending on the design of the game and the quality of the game text, this might be really easy to do (e.g. Dogs Town Creation) or really hard to do (e.g. Call of Cthulhu for some people).<br/><br/>4. Design any monster you like! Pick the options which you think are coolest/most scary/most true to your vision of the monster's lair.<br/><br/>This could work or it could fail, clearly. Not a ton of guidance here, especially if the whole group isn't on the same page.<br/><br/>5. Design any monster you like! Pick the options which you think are coolest/most scary/most true to your vision of the monster's lair. However, make your monsters more dangerous the deeper the adventurers go into the dungeon. Here's a list of what kinds of monsters might be appropriate for the first level of the dungeon. Here's a list for the second level... etc.<br/><br/>This would work very well in conjunction with a game which clearly communicates and supports a playstyle where the players must choose which dangers to confront and which to avoid (and therefore variations in monster ability and threat levels are a feature in play), right? And there's quite a bit of guidance, even though there's no restriction or policing (and the GM could easily screw it up in a number of ways, either by underestimating a monster's capacities, or by failing to communicate the danger of a situation to the players, or whatever else).<br/><br/><br/>I tend to think that my favourite games either a) give clear guidance on how the various tools (and "holes") are supposed to work and then set you free (e.g. Solar System, morality in Dogs in the Vineyard), b) find the perfect tradeoff or balance between freedom and constraint (e.g. should Chess mandate that the players *must* use standard openings?), or c) constrain our options to a tremendous degree so as to make the game easy and reliable to play (e.g. Fiasco playsets).<br/><br/>But I do think that game mastery/art is a valid part of play, and that many games will turn away enthusiasts if they make the game *too* reliable or too easy to play without skill. <br/><br/>(I've been thinking about this a lot with regards to Diplomacy lately, since I've played several games with beginners, and ultimately find "beginner" play to be, very often, unsatisfying or downright unpleasant. I would love to plug some of those "holes" with either solid rules or solid advice/principles of play, but that's not an easy thing to do with such an elegant game.)<br/><br/>Is this analogy at all useful to this discussion? It was getting very theoretical, so I decided to try an analogy. Maybe it's totally off the mark, in which case I won't be offended if you ignore it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408848/#Comment_408848" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T14:04:07+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  2:04PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah!

The thing is, if the GM can just just mercilessly consult the fiction, why isn't task resolution just fine by itself? I think you can see the benefits of conflict resolution. I think you can see the holes that let the GM make you roll stealth over and over if he wants you to fail and the holes that let him have you roll stealth again and again if he wants you to pass. And I think you can see that conflict resolution removes these holes, to a certain degree. Which is precisely what I'm talking about - to have fewer (and thematically placed) holes in the system.<br/><br/>But then you go into mercilessly consulting the fiction. If you want to design games with lots of holes and accepting the ramifications of that, okay. But you seem to be advocating conflict resolution but also saying there are no ramifications if the GM is just very, very particular in his scrutinising of the fiction (in which case why isn't pure task resolution fine?)? </blockquote>\nYou misread me. I'm not particularly advocating conflict resolution; I'm saying that it emerged as a design technique (and a thing we talk about) in response to the same issue that made you start talking about "holes" in the rules. I'm not arguing that rules aren't under-determined; they are. Where I thought we differed is in your notion of "sympathy" as the thing that fills the gaps, although in drilling down on that term it seems like you're not saying anything more than, "Well, someone has to make a judgment call," which is true. I notice that you keep talking about how those judgments are "un-policeable" (because they're in our heads?) but that doesn't really bother me, because as long as player contributions to play conform to the expectations of others at the table, we can expect the game to move forward (this is why I cited the Harviainen piece).<br/><br/>As for the specific merits of conflict vs. task resolution, far be it from me to argue that one is inherently or obviously "better" than the other. Conflict resolution procedures have their own issues. Some players find them immersion-breaking, preferring to simply experience the action and its outcome from a purely in-character perspective. The coupling of conflict resolution with a stakes-setting phase can also be a problem for some, leading as it does potentially to "playing before we play." The fact that "you can resolve a whole battle with one die roll!" is disappointing to some, who find it anti-climactic to do so ("You mean that's it?"). And certainly the one thing that a task resolution system permits is secrecy and suspense, so that players face both the strategic challenge of trying to figure out how best to deploy or husband their resources and the dramatic thrill of fictional surprises, reversals, and narrow victories.<br/><br/>I'm suspicious of how you've been talking about "holes" because I think it leads to bad design conclusions. "My game is more hole-like than chess-like," someone might say after reading this thread, "and that's how I like it. Players will just have to muddle through." As Paul has suggested above, this is more likely to lead to confusion, frustration, and bad play than to serendipitous and exultant discovery. I don't think you as a designer get to say, "Oh, yeah, people will just figure it out"; rather, you give them the procedures or techniques you think they need to get from beginning to end. Sometimes you'll leave something out, maybe because it seemed obvious to you and therefore didn't <i>need</i> to be said, maybe because you just didn't explain it right. Remember the foofaraw over "half-baked games" a few years ago? (But maybe that's not what you mean when you say "holes.") Other times you'll give players too much, and they'll reject your vision of how to play the game. I received some playtest feedback for a Gumshoe game a little while ago where the GM said, "Yeah, I tried handing out clues the way you wanted me to, but I found it slowed things down and made my players clam up, so I dropped it quick smart." In that case, what I tried to do <i>overdetermined</i> the "rule," which only needed to say (and which in fact does say) <i>hand out clues in a way that makes your players happy</i>. But is that a "hole," as in a space for arbitrariness, as you seem possibly to have been suggesting? It doesn't seem so to me; it seems like an instruction that you can try to follow, albeit one that's sufficiently imprecise as to account for a wide range of in-play practices.<br/><br/>That's not to say I don't think there are things that you can and should leave to the artfulness of the GM, or the players; there definitely are. But figuring out what "best practices" are, and working to develop one's skills and mindfulness as a player is a concomitant of that.<br/><br/>Let me make sure I respond specifically to your question. I am not saying that conflict resolution is "better" than task resolution. I am saying that as an idea it seems to me to be a response to issues emerging from the underdetermination of rules for handling some kinds of conflicts in traditional games. There are other possible responses, among which are obeying the "implicit system" and letting the dice fall where they may (itself a kind of conflict resolution, to be sure). In that case, the GM is probably wise to strive for a situation in which either success or failure is interesting, which is exactly the sort of advice that many rulebooks offer in their discussions of how to run the game. This principle thus serves in effect as a rule--not a very precise one, of course, but hopefully good enough to go on.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408876/#Comment_408876" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T20:19:23+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  8:19PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (As an aside, I think conflict resolution is usually easier to codify into a system with fewer 'holes'. If we're trying to determine whether you're in a position to roll "pick pockets", we have to convince each other that is, indeed, the case. And there are *so* many possible objections--where you are, how noisy it is, how alert the person is, where their purse is, etc, etc, etc. But with many conflict resolution systems it's easy to say, "Player B may invoke the conflict resolution rules any time they wish during an Intrigue Scene, and roll accordingly." This isn't always true--some types of games can have procedural task resolution, like a D&amp;D 4E combat, and some other games have very vague initiation of conflict resolution -- e.g. Dogs in the Vineyard -- but I think it's a tendency.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408970/#Comment_408970" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T18:32:46+00:00" title="March 13, 2013  6:32PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2013 6:48PM by Callan_S.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, if you were simply describing a series of aesthetic choices, I'd grant you weren't advocating anything in particular.

You're implying that conflict resolution is clearly superior to task resolution in all circumstances and I've tried to demonstrate that that isn't so, and that in fact there are players who will reject conflict resolution, or at least some forms of it (particularly if it involves stake-setting) because it seems to require too much "out of character" thinking. So when you say, "But if there is a <i>problem</i> - then admit a problem. And that not all solutions are equal," it seems to me like you're not reading what I write, or are ignoring it.<br/><br/>However, for me to go down this road (i.e., task vs. conflict resolution) is a digression. My point was that I read you as arguing, "Deploy holes strategically! Artistically! Thematically!" and I'm saying that's bad advice.  \n<blockquote><blockquote><i>I notice that you keep talking about how those judgments are "un-policeable" (because they're in our heads?) but that doesn't really bother me, because as long as player contributions to play conform to the expectations of others at the table, we can expect the game to move forward</i></blockquote>\nThis is policing as well.

I've given you an example of what I mean, by referring to my <a href="http://knutepunkt.laiv.org/2009/book/FaceAndFigurationInRPGPlay/" rel="nofollow">Knutepunkt article</a>, in which players and GM work to repair an instance of expectation-breaking.\n<blockquote><blockquote>"My game is more hole-like than chess-like," someone might say after reading this thread, "and that's how I like it.

Also, I notice that you seem to think that obscurity is a virtue, that it somehow marks your argument as irrefutable or something.

The adventure that the guy was playtesting did indeed have advice on clue-giving. "Put the clue on an index card and hand it to the relevant player instead of reading it to the table," I had written, or words to that effect. "That way the player can take ownership of the clue and be more awesome." This GM came back and told me, nope, that doesn't work for me and my players. It stifled our free-wheelingness and made us uncomfortable, he said, so I stopped doing it. My point was that it's possible to "overdetermine" the rules and procedures you offer others, so being aware of different playstyles is probably a good idea.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the previous part of your reply is trying to argue. I read it as saying that holes exist, and we fill them in, and that's fine. I guess  I agree, but my argument is that thinking of the underdetermined parts of your game as "holes" that your players will just "fill in" naturally, without any more solid understanding of the varieties of play techniques that will be brought to bear, is bad practice. It's better, I think, to focus on the important elements of the play experience you're trying to create, and work them as hard as you can, shedding other stuff as it's revealed to be unnecessary. "Yeah, I don't need <i>this</i> rule, and I don't need <i>this</i> one."<br/><br/>Maybe you think the same thing; it seems so from when you say, "'whatever makes them happy' no doubt instead of showing up as a hole shows up as a wide range of in-play practices." Well, yes, exactly.\n<blockquote>I'll pitch it as a dungeon room - the phrase 'do what makes them happy' is on a wall and you can either say it doesn't tell you what to do (and if you do, you can leave the room freely).

Artistically! Thematically!" and I'm saying that's bad advice.</blockquote>\nFrom what you said\n<blockquote>"My game is more hole-like than chess-like," someone might say after reading this thread, "and that's how I like it. Players will just have to muddle through." </blockquote>\nWell, traditional RPG's are considerably hole like. And that conflict resolution disliking guy (that must be included in design consideration) was no doubt raised like the rest of us on trad RPG's and so likes that kind of holey game.<br/><br/>So how is that bad or a problem? Particularly if the holes are made clear and anyone who doesn't like them will stear clear of playing it? It sounds like you're saying one way of playing is bad, where I'm just saying give people a chance to decide if they avoid that way of playing or indulge in it.\n<blockquote>You're going to have to give me an example, because this kind of blanket assertion is unsatisfying. I've given you an example of what I mean, by referring to my Knutepunkt article, in which players and GM work to repair an instance of expectation-breaking.</blockquote>\nI'll leave it to others as to whether one aught to go through a 14 page document. I'll just ask why are they working to 'repair' anything? As I've said, the answer is you don't ask why, you just get on it, unless you want to be ostracised to a degree. Which is a method of policing.<br/><br/>Or there's some reason why, that could be explicitly described.<br/>\n<blockquote>Yeah, I disagree. Also, I notice that you seem to think that obscurity is a virtue, that it somehow marks your argument as irrefutable or something.</blockquote>\nYou seem to have no doubt as to what you've decided I think. I can't argue you out of something you don't doubt.<br/><br/>Obscurity is more likely to come from simply making conclusions then acting on them without asking if that's what the other guy thinks.\n<blockquote>Like in a post above where you say, "That'll be my counter-argument, that I can summarize your position so well," as if the fact that you think you understand me means that there's something wrong with what I'm saying. That's crazy ;-)</blockquote>\nEither A: You never thought in your head 'It's not that I'm wrong, it's just that he doesn't understand my argument. Once he gets it, he'll see!' or B: You did think that and as a form of counter argument, I'm showing that actually I do undestand your argument quite well.<br/><br/>Fair enough if it's A and I'm missplaced. But I was trying to charitably read you.<br/><br/>But if it's B, and you're not aware of your own conclusion that I don't understand your argument, yet I can accurately guess your conclusions you're working from but not even aware of, then...what?<br/><br/>Of course I can second guess the reaction to that is that it's rediculous that I could guess such a thing accurately. And really it's kind of pompous of me or some social stigma word. Even though I wasn't the first to apply the word 'crazy'.<br/><br/>Just joking! ;-)\n<blockquote>This GM came back and told me, nope, that doesn't work for me and my players. It stifled our free-wheelingness and made us uncomfortable, he said, so I stopped doing it.</blockquote>\nIn that case the GM just wasn't willing to try out the game as is. Some of Ron Edwards trying out of games I read recently (but can't find the link to) has another player getting frustrated with something and moving to make a change - and Ron says no, to play the game as is.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know how you think as a designer you can compensate for players who just reject doing X or Y (and not because it physically harms them or anything. Just aesthetic rejection). What you've given is an example of a group who just ignored the game you wrote.\n<blockquote>I'm not sure what the previous part of your reply is trying to argue. I read it as saying that holes exist, and we fill them in, and that's fine. I guess I agree, but my argument is that thinking of the underdetermined parts of your game as "holes" that your players will just "fill in" naturally, without any more solid understanding of the varieties of play techniques that will be brought to bear, is bad practice.</blockquote>\nThe larger the holes (or the more of them), the more 'varieties of play techniques' that can be brought to bear.<br/><br/>And I'm arguing to have fewer holes and strategically placed. Surely I'm arguing in line with what you say?<br/><br/>I suspect you think I mean to try and remove 'bad practice' by hole reduction. Ie, your idea of bad practice. No, not especially. I just refer to making such, whether subjectively good or bad, not dominate play so utterly and that mechanics will then utilise it to form play.\n<blockquote>What? I don't understand this comment. </blockquote>\nIt's a binary decision in the dungeon room scenario - just assign heads to one choice and flip a coin if you want.<br/><br/>I'm kind of surprised, given were both roleplayers of some years, that it's somehow confusing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17971/callans-mechanical-tea-sympathy/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17971/callans-mechanical-tea-sympathy">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17971/callans-mechanical-tea-sympathy/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17971/callans-mechanical-tea-sympathy/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17971/callans-mechanical-tea-sympathy/p4">4</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17971%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17971%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
