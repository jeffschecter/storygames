It's kinda interesting, although the opinions soon coalesce into a few camps, each camp's members with their own strong feelings about how games should work, etc.<br/><a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=542759" rel="nofollow">"I Don't Reward Roleplaying!"</a><br/><br/>It's an interesting discussion to me, because I can see within it about 3-4 different opinions that even I myself had on this topic, and how it changed over the years.<br/><br/>For example, now, I <b>only</b> like to play games where roleplaying is rewarded (!!!). Major games that set me on this weird path to where I am today include:<br/><br/>Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium. (The "Cool Rule")<br/>Primetime Adventures (Fanmail)<br/>The Shadow of Yesterday (Friend dice)<br/>Tenra Bansho (Aiki chits)<br/>etc<br/>etc<br/><br/>In fact, more often than not these days, as my gaming group can attest to, on "long campaign" style games, if a fanmail-like mechanic doesn't exist, I'll find an easy way to introduce one to the game.<br/><br/>Now, by roleplaying I don't simply mean the "act of acting out a role", I really mean "stepping up your (personal) game", "dropping a line - on purpose or inadvertantly - that is a game-changer or jaw-dropper", etc. We'll always do personal feedback ("Woah!", "Cool!", etc), but I like games that actually drop a reward (character power, game-changing stuff) for going above and beyond with that role-playing.<br/><br/>Comparing that to things I used to reward as a GM: "Accomplishing goals" (to get XP, etc) seems kinda hollow: It means that they basically followed my pre-set path without too much complication or variance, not necessarily bringing anything memorable to the table. I have run or played in lots of games where great goals were accomplished (for the setting, the party, the player) but where I can't remember really anything much about those games. And yet, I can very much recall games that were seeped in some poignant role-playing moments (whether they were explicitly awarded or not).<br/><br/>Awards for showing up ("being able to play the game is reward in itself"), bringing food and stuff, I could go either way on. But I've really fallen for systems that put effort into having the players step up their game, acting/role-wise.<br/><br/>What about you? What do you like to see rewarded in your games?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297457/#Comment_297457" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T13:45:10+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  1:45PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me get my helmet back on... been a while since I needed it. OK, here goes: The OWoD games rewarded you for portraying your Nature and Demeanor with Willpower, which was vitally important in those systems. That made Mage and Vampire, in particular, into games about Nature and Demeanor, i.e. they rewarded you for roleplaying. That worked for me in a big way, even if it tended to lead to hamming and narrow (or maybe "archetypal") characterizations. I remember those characters.<br/><br/>Paranoia rewarded players for entertaining the GM, a useful because explicit inversion of the usual expectations. I thought that was a great idea, and it was pretty mind-expanding the first time I encountered it. If you have a GM, and you don't want him to be The Entertainer, give him a fanmail mechanic for the other players!<br/><br/>A Penny for my Thoughts rewards asking good questions, and giving the other players something to grab on to, narratively. It also helps out players who are having trouble accumulating currency by letting the other players offer more guidance to them when their turns arrive, as a useful side effect; it might be the most mechanically sophisticated game I've ever played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297471/#Comment_297471" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T14:16:20+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  2:16PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2010 2:17PM by DannyK.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked the old WW idea of giving out extra credit for bluebooking and other forms of lonely fun.

In fact, one problem (?) I have is that my best friend and I have roleplayed together since 1992. He knows exactly what kind of roleplaying stuff I like. In games with fanmail, roleplaying awards that are in my hands, or whatever, he is always going to get that reward, every time, one hundred percent, because he knows how to push my buttons.  This isn't bad, exactly, because we wouldn't play together for 18 years if we didn't have compatible preferences.  But it also doesn't make either of us really push ourselves to do new or different things or to try things out.  We can get these rewards just by playing to each other's well-known preferences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297517/#Comment_297517" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T17:56:05+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  5:56PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://bankuei.wordpress.com/2010/10/18/reward-systems/" rel="nofollow">Mr. Chinn killed this topic dead</a> already.

Roleplaying is not kicking a ball.  I'd say the topic is still alive and well.  <br/><br/>I brought it up before - <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12668" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12668</a><br/><br/>I haven't played enough games like BW or TSOY to deserve an opinion, but I'm going to give it anyway.  My limited experience with Keys/Beliefs/Aspects is that our roleplaying feels 'forced' and 'unnatural' and flow is broken as we ask the GM for our cookies.  And theoretically, there's a ton of reasons why a mechanical-incentive system (particularly one where the GM is distributing awards), could be a bad idea:<br/>* don't fix something that ain't broke;  perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away - if our co-players are bringing it without encouragement, why mess with the system?  There's a bunch of great games out there that don't give you cookies for roleplaying and people roleplay with them anyway.  (In a Wicked Age, Fiasco, D&amp;D)<br/>* you can break flow, interrupting the good stuff to hand out cookies or ask for cookies<br/>* you're just replacing one goal ("I want to play a character who's bent on revenge") with another ("I want to earn XP or narrative power, by playing a character bent on revenge")<br/>* the rewards themselves are suspect.  Why do I want XP?  So I can get buffs?  Why do I want buffs?  So I can get more XP?<br/>* incentive systems are notoriously hard, maybe impossible, to get right.  You inadvertently find yourself incentivizing the wrong thing.  (Lady Blackbird incentivizes throwing away your secret romance key so you can get buffs - is that really what Harper intended?) You can even accidentally disincentivize!  A couple real-world examples are the day-care where they started charging parents who picked up their kids late (the parents started doing it more) [that one's from *Freakonomics*];  the classroom where kids were paid to draw (the kids drew, but then refused to draw unless paid, whereas the control group drew anyway).  <br/>* even fan-mail can be gamed by saying "You give me all your fan-mail and I'll give you all mine" - although nobody would really take it that far, I bet frequently there's something unspoken,  like (I gave Joe fan mail so now he kind of owes me.)<br/>* so these systems seem to come with an assumption:  "We're not going to try to game/exploit this"  Which makes you wonder why we made a gamey system out of the thing in the first place, if we're not going to play it to win.<br/><br/><br/>I like:<br/><br/>Taking the XP out of Pathfinder and D&amp;D.  That's how we've played our last two campaigns.  Every two-three sessions, Lisa says "You all go up a level."  Now, the decision to kill a monster or let them get away is purely in the fiction.  "Banish" is possibly a better spell than "Dimensional Anchor".  We've been given permission to roleplay.<br/><br/>I like clearly stating character's goals:  IaWA's best interests, for example.  Games need goals.  Stories need goals.  You don't need to get cookies for pursuing your goals, but you have to have goals.  <br/><br/>I like how in AW you get experience for making rolls on highlighted stats, especially if you treat everything as a stat including Angel Kit and History-With-Joe and whatnot.  Flow's not broken because it's not a matter of opinion whether you deserve your cookie or not, and I haven't figured out how to game it.  It's not really incentivizing role-playing, though:  you could make a roll that works against your character's goals and get XP for it.<br/><br/>And I don't think fan mail hurts anything - at best, people are getting rewarded for being the kind of players the others want them to be, and at worst people game it but they can't really break the game with it.

I would argue that In A Wicked Age absolutely as an RP based reward mechanic.  It's embedded in the stats.  If I imagine that my character is very passionate and when he's worked up about something I really want him to shine, then I put my d12 in "with Love".  So when I'm in that moment, clearly, acting "with Love" then I get my d12.  Conversely, maybe I want the opposite, maybe I think my dude is always charging into shit and it makes him suffer.  So I put my d6 or d4 in "with Love" and when I go charging in I don't do as well.  That's just a much a reward as being more effective.  And hell, in that case, I likely go on the We Owe list as well meaning my guy gets to keep coming back and charging into stuff until he learns his lesson.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297672/#Comment_297672" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-20T13:52:46+00:00" title="October 20, 2010  1:52PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2010 1:40PM by DannyK.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, here's another way of saying what I posted: fanmail is just a way of saying "I love you, man" without being dead drunk.

I will say that I enjoy mechanics that demand *decisions* of me, but I don't think I need incentives to be more in character, "step it up", etc. What's tricky for me is actually being given too much space to "just roleplay" - I like when either the mechanics or the procedures give a little push-pull, giving me some sense of what I'm "supposed to be doing". <br/>That continues to be the itch that Fiasco leaves with me (again, only played it twice, both times with story-game n00bs) - although I think the best way to describe this phenomenon is simply "low handling time", i.e. a lower-than-average number of instances in which players interact with system beyond the social contract. That's not quite related to reward systems, but it's definitely a "reward" for playing - the sense that one is interacting at one's preferred level with not-just-social mechanics. <br/>Back on topic: I do think that Sorcerer's "bonus dice for good description; <i>penalty</i> for lazy description" is interesting - have you tried that out at all?

If so, what did you think? Or what did anybody think, for that matter?</blockquote>\nOne of the things that really helped me with this was to take the break down in the book VERY LITERALLY.  It's a little more specific than just "good description."  This is the exact break down:<br/><br/>+2 For an usual version of an action.<br/>+2 For a situation changing action.<br/>+1 For for particularly compelling dialogue.<br/><br/>Those are my paraphrases anyway.  So that's up to a total of 5 dice and I follow those exact values and break down exactly.  It's a lot more "objective" than you would think.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>A player was being shot by a nail gun.  He said, "I pick up the table and use it like a shield."  I thought that was interesting but it was a bar fight with lots of furniture use already so no bonus.  He succeeded and then he said this, "Okay, now that the table is filled with nails, I ram him with it."  Holy fuck!  Two die bonus for "unusual version of the action".  He also said it about as blandly as I described it here.  The point is that it wasn't the *description* that counted, it was the actions *content* that mattered.<br/><br/>I've had players give me the most detailed description of the most bog standard "sweep kick" or "upper cut punch" and I always just kind of look at them stoney faced.  They seem to expect the dice and they don't get them from me.<br/><br/>Here's an example of a full FIVE die bonus from one of my games.<br/><br/>The story involved a property dispute.  After being confronted with the antagonist's legal representative the player simply said this, "Let me summon my lawyer."  That's it.  The WHOLE table new what in a SORCERER game that damn well meant.<br/><br/>+1 Witty Dialogue<br/>+2 Unusual version of an action.  SUMMON a lawyer?!<br/>+2 Situation changer.  Oh fuck yeah, that was going to change the situation.<br/><br/>"Let me summon my lawyer"  5 words, 5 die bonus.<br/><br/>The penalty is actually much, much rarer.  I generally use it to remind players not to repeat themselves.  So a player might say, "I jump up from behind the bar and shoot him."  That's a no adjustment kind of action either way.  But then sometimes they'll follow it with, "I shoot him again."  And that's when I'll apply the penalty.<br/><br/>Things can switch from a bonus situation to a penalty situation when you do that to.  I was playing in a game where a player tried to jump on a giant spider's back to ride it.  I gave him a +2 for unusual action.  But it didn't work out (I think he had to abort to defend himself).  So the next round he tried it again and I gave him a -1 for repeating himself.  He took it because he REALLY, REALLY wanted to give it a go.  He actually succeeded.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297809/#Comment_297809" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T12:36:47+00:00" title="October 21, 2010 12:36PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>OK, here's another way of saying what I posted: fanmail is just a way of saying "I love you, man" without being dead drunk.

Personally, my love for my friends has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with how cool their role-playing is, and I can express it without being drunk.  But fanmail can easily be taken as the love.  <br/><br/>I find this to be a drawback, in that I have seen games with similar reward mechanics change from an atmosphere of everyone hanging out and being cool by having fun together - into an atmosphere where everyone is trying to be cool, and the people who are the coolest get the most rewards.  I think this goes back to E.T. Smith's point (from Dan Pink) that instant-reward cycles don't necessarily motivate - especially for creative tasks, since people are often not Pavlovian.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297813/#Comment_297813" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T12:58:17+00:00" title="October 21, 2010 12:58PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, do you feel the same discomfort with Sorcerer's bonus dice?

I was playing Polaris a few months ago, and I found myself delivering a monologue about my character's background. I didn't get any explicit feedback from my fellow players, but because the background had no impact on the events of play, I found it rather boring to deliver.<br/>Here's a twist: the difference between "rewarded by the GM/other players" vs. something in the rules/procedures that you, a player, find <i>personally motivating or inspiring</i>. For example - the key phrase But Only If in Polaris is delightful for the person who's using it (imo), even if it doesn't lead to any explicit metagame Currency. Being able to do that, to riposte by raising the stakes, is its own reward, in my book, especially if you haven't played a game with that much player agency before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297830/#Comment_297830" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T13:33:07+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  1:33PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its never as simple as "rewarding roleplaying"<br/>\n<br/>\nTake Wu Shu for instance.

In the end what it winds up rewarding is nothing so much as colorful descriptions ad naseum.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the other extreme, the earlier mentioned Burning Wheel has tremendous structure that at the end of the day rewards "roleplaying" without ever falling into the "reward cool color moment by moment" trap.

Despite my best efforts, he remained convinced that such moment to moment rewards are exactly what's needed to convince people to spend their time roleplaying rather than roll playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297831/#Comment_297831" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T13:36:26+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  1:36PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>John, do you feel the same discomfort with Sorcerer's bonus dice?

I grafted a rudimentary story drive mechanic onto the otherwise traditional system I was running for them in an attempt to create a richer play experience for all. The result was desultory at best. The power-gamer used the Story-Drives tactically, turning to them only when he wanted to generate additional bennies to pump up his dice rolls. The method-actor found the Drives confining, feeling they put unnatural limits on the organic development of his character. The lump never understood them, and never engaged with the system.<br><br/>An earlier group had an even stronger negative reaction. Again, trad system with a bit of Nar embellishment, this time a class-and-level fantasy game where I eliminated XP for gold-n-monsters  in lieu of a list of checkmarks of genre-appropriate behavior (something like "did you face a worthy foe this session? get 100 XP. Did you act per your alignment?" etc.). This did not go over well <i>at all</i>. As one player told me point blank, "I put up with this kind of performance evaluation crap at work, I don't want to see it in my game."<br/><br/>At the time, I shrugged off these kind of events as failure on my part to implement the system well. But with time and some more experience with myself in the role of player engaged with a Narr-reward system, in games that seemed to function in spite of the rewards cycles rather than because of them, I'm coming to formulate specific doubts: The player who wants to do the "deep role-play" thing is going to do it whether he's given active encouragement or not. Often, attempting to formalize that kind of creativity just trips it up. On the other hand, the player who doesn't care for it, just won't, and trying to push them toward just makes play annoying for them.<br/><br/>The best games I've run happen when I:<br/>*Give them plenty of time and options to figure out what they want to do.<br/>*Get out of the way and let them do it.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297886/#Comment_297886" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T19:31:31+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  7:31PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2010 7:33PM by Jesse.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>The mistake I see people new to S-G techniques make is just being like, "Yeah so I guess I passionately hate that evil warlord." </blockquote>\nWhich I believe is also the cause of the "breaking the flow" or "stiltedness" people experience with these direct reward system.  These games work best when the system is simply rewarding you for what you were planning on doing anyway.  They're a measure of how well, you're living up to your own vision and standards.  In other words you do X and SURPRISE the mechanic kicks in almost as an after thought.<br/><br/>When people aren't committed to the Keys/Aspects/Beliefs for their own sake *first* then they start simply reaching and stretching trying to kick the mechanic into effect as many times as they can, likely because they are invested in something else and need the mechanical benefits to pull it off.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297888/#Comment_297888" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T19:40:31+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  7:40PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2010 7:44PM by Jesse.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: E.T.Smith</cite>The player who wants to do the "deep role-play" thing is going to do it whether he's given active encouragement or not.

It's about *encoding*.  I want the full cycle in my games.  I don't want to be off over here ----&gt; doing my deep role-play thing while Mr. Tactics next to me rolls his eyes and lets me do my thing as long as I don't get in his way.  I like something Luke or Jared (I forget which) said in an interview: When I talk to the game, I want the game to talk back.<br/><br/>I want to take all my deep passionate character play and be able successfully encode that into the mechanics.  I want the fact that this moment is the moment I chose to betray my lover to MATTER mechanically.  I want to see that betrayal in the system, not just in my voice.  Then I want the mechanics to crank out a result which I then de-code back into my deep passionate character play.  That's why it's called a reward CYCLE.  I talk to the game, the game talks back which informs my next input.  When that input-output flow is based on acts of passionate character expression  then I enjoy the game most.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297889/#Comment_297889" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-21T19:44:09+00:00" title="October 21, 2010  7:44PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 21, 2010 8:01PM by E.T.Smith.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Something Jesse (Burneko) has pointed out before but that bears repeating: in games that ask you to choose something like Keys or Beliefs or Spiritual Attributes, or even just Goals\u2014you have to really fucking care about them.

You and your players aren't passionate about stuff?  I mean, it's easy for me to take keys or beliefs or goals (or whatever) about things like: deschooling, artistic integrity, the underdog fighting against the man, giving people a fair shake, rebellion or parenthood (just to name a few) and play them hard because I'm passionate about those things.  <br/><br/>I mean, I don't care about the relationship between the snake god and the goblin king at the start of a new game either -- so I wouldn't target those things to start with.  Maybe in six sessions when the goblin king has turned out to be pretty decent and the followers of the snake god are moving in on him it'll be different and I'll care.  But I can still start the game running because _I_ *care* about stuff that can translate into any setting.

I'm not getting bribed or insulted or being rewarded for roleplay, I am playing a game: gaining or spending a fate chip is no different from my character regaining 1d8+3 hit points for casting a spell or making a hunting roll and getting X number of blood points for it or my character buying a grenade to throw at the bad guys.  Divorced from the "that was some good roleplaying, have a cookie!" message, it's just a system, and a functional one that allows for some good give-and-take between me and the other people at the table.  I was actually surprised at how well it worked in play, in fact; I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>I can also use an Aspect to highlight things about my character that I want to be important and in the front of everyone else's minds when we're playing (his deep-seated loyalty to his family, his womanizing, whatever): in that instance, the Aspect is not about getting me to play my character "properly," but rather, helping me to sell the character I am playing to everyone else and giving them easy handles to guide how their characters interact with mine.<br/><br/>I wouldn't use FATE and/or Aspects in every game, but it was fun and works great for some games, so ultimately I have no beef with it.  I do think that coming at Aspects from a "it rewards roleplaying" perspective is the wrong way to go, though; it's not a reward given to the player, it's just a resource system.<br/><br/><br/>Beyond that, I tend to agree with a lot of what's already been said in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298077/#Comment_298077" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-23T09:26:38+00:00" title="October 23, 2010  9:26AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Why are you giving me a chip for simply being a good roleplayer and playing my character?

The theory is that most characters are multi-faceted enough that there are multiple ways they could approach situations, and the compel mechanic is a way to see which particular situations are engaging to the player and which are not by shining a spotlight on one particular path to see if that's the one they want to take. If "new problem + 1 FATE point" roughly balances with "-1 FATE point" then it isn't a straight reward. From listening to AP podcasts and from my own FATE experience, compels can sometimes not work as well in practice as the theory predicts. Some people start to treat FATE points like "good roleplaying rewards" and hand them out for rich in-character idle banter, or let players fast-talk their way out of facing any consequences for accepting the compel. The bigger problem is when the compel functions like a double reward: if you as a player are eager to face particular types of problems then the offer of a problem of that type is something you wouldn't want to refuse so there's no real decision with the compel -- you accept the problem and the FATE point and are happy for both. Since FATE scenario generation and "good compels" are somewhat nebulously intertwined with the concept of "good GMing" it's hard to evaluate the compel mechanic in isolation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298155/#Comment_298155" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T03:43:39+00:00" title="October 25, 2010  3:43AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2010 3:45AM by D-503.">edited October 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Take Wu Shu for instance.

Really?  Worse than Cyborg Commando say, or Rifts?  I don't personally particularly like the game but people regularly play it as written and enjoy it, so I struggle to see how it could be broken.  <br/><br/>Also, its rules aren't about rewarding roleplaying, they're about rewarding colourful descriptions.  I think you've fundamentally misunderstood what the game is seeking to achieve.  Rewarding colourful descriptions is the point, in fact it's the explicitly stated point.  Wushu doesn't have a mechanic for rewarding roleplaying and one could reap full benefits under the rules without ever getting into character in any meaningful sense.<br/><br/>Sorry for the tangent, I was just taken aback by how wrong-headed this criticism seemed to be.

Wushu's not to my taste, but that's no reason to mischaracterise it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298157/#Comment_298157" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-25T03:51:43+00:00" title="October 25, 2010  3:51AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the rpg.net thread by the way was about a very specific sort of reward mechanism, that is a system which awards xp for various activities (killing monsters, solving puzzles, spending money, whatever) and which includes bonus xp for roleplaying well.<br/><br/>It's a common thing to see, particularly since the 1990s.  Like that rpg.net poster I think it's a terrible idea.<br/><br/>XP bonuses for roleplaying raise two main issues.  Firstly, you're monetising something people have come wanting to do anyway, which diminishes it and may even disincentivise it ultimately.  Secondly, you're giving the GM a mechanical means with which to impact how the player portrays their character, which in a traditional rpg context is I think a big no no.<br/><br/>After all, if GM Bob doesn't like how I play my character Pete the Paladin, his idea of how I should roleplay my character now manifests into an effect on how fast my character progresses.  But, that character is all I have, how I roleplay him really should be up to me.<br/><br/>Now, what does that mean for reward mechanisms in a story games context?  Not very much I suspect, it's a problem peculiar to a particular reward mechanic in the context of a particular play paradigm and within that mechanic and paradigm it doesn't work.  More sophisticated reward mechanisms in games with other paradigms could potentially work just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298365/#Comment_298365" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-26T14:16:10+00:00" title="October 26, 2010  2:16PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: noclue&lt;/cite&gt;Because beliefs are important and skills aren't. MG is about creating your character's beliefs and instincts, playing that character with integrity and seeing how the character evolves through adversity. That's how the game rewards roleplaying. By being about that stuff. Skills are just tools you use along the way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nIf skills are unimportant why spend so many pages describing them? I think they are a fairly good way to inspire character actions, I likely would not craft mouse armor if i did not see Armour listed in the skill category.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy have only advice for something that is so important?<br/>\n<br/>\nI work hard as a designer so I can be a very lazy player, to me playing a game is about my reactions to things. games are there to not only start the ball rolling but also create the physics that control the ball. So while I love "playing that character with integrity and seeing how the character evolves through adversity." I don't really feel like creating that character from "whole cloth" or being the one who writes such an incredibly important bit of text.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess "play time" is functioning very diffidently for us, for me it's an engaging way to not "work" i'm guessing for many people role play is a creative outlet. thats cool, after a day of filling blank pages (or cutting them to bits to make papercraft) i really seek to not be in a creative struggle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298369/#Comment_298369" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-26T14:29:33+00:00" title="October 26, 2010  2:29PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, that's exactly the experience we had experimenting with Wushu around here.

The thing I really do like about Wushu is the interchangeability of Details, so you can describe your guy getting beat down in loving detail and it's every bit as effective as the guy who uses clever tactics.

Then it doesn't matter if you then stutter trough it or deliver something brilliant - the fun is in seeing you try. Any mechanical rewards are usually given out by popular demand.<br><br>You might say that I've showed them the carrot and the stick, and then we all decided to go have cake instead?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Roleplaying Rewards! - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13218/roleplaying-rewards/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Roleplaying Rewards! - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13218/roleplaying-rewards/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: D-503It's a common thing to see, particularly since the 1990s.

class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>It's a common thing to see, particularly since the 1990s.  Like that rpg.net poster I think it's a terrible idea.<br/><br/>XP bonuses for roleplaying raise two main issues.  Firstly, you're monetising something people have come wanting to do anyway, which diminishes it and may even disincentivise it ultimately.Secondly, you're giving the GM a mechanical means with which to impact how the player portrays their character, which in a traditional rpg context is I think a big no no.</blockquote>\nI'm curious how various games stack up against this statement: <br/><br/>FATE Aspects - These are awarded by the GM when they compel an aspect in order to take the game in an interesting way. It's a recognition by the GM that the player made their job easier by feeding them a juicy plot point. The mechanic is obviously meant to flesh out the story and encourage roleplaying your character, but it doesn't directly award the behavior.<br/><br/>TSOY Keys - Obviously also meant to encourage bringing the character into the game and driving play with what's on the sheet. However, a player awards oneself. <br/><br/>PTA Fan Mail - Awarded by the table, excluding the GM, based on the group's subjective idea of what is entertaining. <br/><br/>Burning Wheel Artha - Awarded specifically for bringing the character's beliefs into play, and for playing instincts and traits when they do not provide a mechanical advantage. Playing beliefs is the character's primary purpose for existing, and challenging those beliefs is the GM's primary role. So, this mechanic is the heart of the game.<br/><br/>The above mechanics have been factors in some fantastic sessions of gaming for me. So, it would be hard for me to call any of them "a big no no."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13218/roleplaying-rewards" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13218/roleplaying-rewards" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13218/roleplaying-rewards/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F13218%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F13218%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
