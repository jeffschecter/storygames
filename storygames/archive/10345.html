He\u2019s impressed by his perception of what indie RPGs can sell and was considering going that direction. I told him I thought his sales expectations were unrealistic for just selling his game without having a name or some other way to promote it. <br/><br/>How many indie RPGs have sold 1000+ copies purely on the merit of the game itself? Meaning the designer was previously unknown and just put their game up for sale? <br/><br/>My understanding is that many well selling indie RPGs have had more things going for it than just the game itself on sale online. <br/><br/>My understanding is that most people who have sold 1000+ indie RPGs:<br/><br/>- have a previously established reputation<br/>- built a community beforehand or around their game<br/>- license existing properties<br/>- work with known people or cross promote<br/>- service the RPG fan community in other ways first (podcasts for example)<br/>- make frequent convention appearances, run demos, lead seminars<br/>- help others in the community first or requently share their knowledge<br/>- winning awards<br/>- offer free product or services. <br/><br/>A possibly exception that springs to mind is PTA. I think the general appeal of the concept, innovative design, and low barrier to entry have really pushed it far on its own. <br/><br/>Any other games?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229946/#Comment_229946" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T21:28:14+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  9:28PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Fred Hicks did it with Don't Rest Your Head.

I did a few demos, sold a few copies, you know, kind of how I figured it would go.

This is a topic Luke and I talked about the last time I saw him. And, it's a topic I think about a lot lately.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure I can count the number of creator-owned publishers who can/have sold 1,000 copies in 2 years on one hand. I'm certain I can count it on two hands.<br/><br/>I have never sold 1,000 copies of any of my games. We're talking a 6-7 year span. I'm far from the top of the heap in that regard, and obviously I'm no longer in the market (save a few "left over" copies of Dust Devils at IPR). EDIT: You know, in retrospect, it's possible I hit 1,000 with PDF sales, but I still doubt it. I don't have a record of the earlier PDF sales anymore after I moved web hosts.<br/><br/>As far as I'm able to discern, the people who have definitely sold that many copies (and maybe not even over 2 years) is Ron, Luke, Fred, and Vincent. In fairness, I don't know specifics for each of those, though I have talked with Luke about it, and I'm reasonably certain he's "top of the heap" in terms of sales. I have also talked with Ron over the years, but don't know his numbers, especially lately.<br/><br/>Certainly, there are other contenders, but I'm skeptical they hit 1,000 sales in 2 years. But, sure, it's possible.<br/><br/>So, I just wrote this <a href="http://www.storiesyouplay.com/2009/09/publishing-easily-marketable-games/" rel="nofollow">blog post about this topic</a>. It's me thinking out loud. And, I suppose it has potential to start a fucking flame war. I'd love people to read it and talk about it. To have a conversation. But, I'm begging you, no fucking flame wars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230005/#Comment_230005" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T06:37:04+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  6:37AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, thanks for the information!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.storiesyouplay.com/2009/09/publishing-easily-marketable-games/" rel="nofollow">Coincidentally, Matt Snyder posted a somewhat related article at Stories You Play...</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230006/#Comment_230006" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T06:42:37+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  6:42AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!

In those textbooks, they defined marketing as <strong>the process of getting your product into your consumer's hands</strong>.  Most folks, when they hear 'marketing' they think <em>promotion</em> and <em>advertising</em>.  The reality (as described in the textbook, at least) is that advertising is a subset of promotion, and promotion is a subset of marketing.  Marketing also includes distribution, payment structures, customer relations, and perhaps most importantly, <em>product design</em>.  All of the steps that you have to take to get your product in consumers' hands \u2014 that's marketing.<br/><br/>Which means the question is even more flawed, really.  You can't sell things without marketing.  Period.  So the question isn't "How do I get fantastic sales without marketing?"  If you're selling anything at all, even one copy, you're doing some marketing \u2014 otherwise your product wouldn't be in the consumer's hands.  The question being asked is, roughly, "How do I get fantastic sales with <em>crappy</em> marketing?"  And the answer is: you don't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230042/#Comment_230042" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T08:54:39+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  8:54AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite> But I'm still waiting for the verdict from ON HIGH about which products of Monte's are Indie enough to be Indie.

It's obvious to many. But I know people who are dissapointed when their game doesn't sell but they haven't done anything to make it sell other than make the game. <br/><br/>I think this might be part of the difference in adoption between free and commercial games. Often selling a game commercially drives people to do promotion they normally wouldn't enjoy doing. Which isn't to say you can't do all the same things you do to promote a free game that you can with a commercial game. You definitely can. <br/><br/>For me, this isn't a hooray for marketing and promotions (2 things I see being very different). Those things can suck. For me, this is mostly just about having realistic expectations. I think the person who has a better understanding of what they can expect for the work they put in will be happier in the long run.<br/><br/>I think Michael Miller once said that his goal was to do 1/5th of the work Luke does for 1/5th of the profit. I think that's a healthy attitude. Vs. say wanting to be Luke without putting in the crazy... crazy amount of work he does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230046/#Comment_230046" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T09:02:17+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  9:02AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to requote Matt Wilson again.

This was not an unreasonable expectation, really: back in the day, anything anybody brought to print was snapped up by the indiesphere lickity-split.  When <em>FLFS</em> was published, I had something like 70 pre-orders, I think, and sold through the rest of the initial print run pretty quickly.  But I also saw a very precipitous drop in sales right after.  That "golden era" was over.<br><br>This was also, as Ralph points out, because there simply weren't that many games that actually made it to print back then \u2014 perhaps ten games came out a year, and there were twenty or thirty being developed and taking up mindshare.  Today the indiesphere probably pumps out over 100 titles a year, whether they're published for free or for sale, and my gut estimate says there's probably 500 titles in development competing for attention.  The indie game publishing game has changed \u2014 considerably \u2014 and we can't expect the same instant response that new games used to get.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230057/#Comment_230057" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T09:44:35+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  9:44AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2009 9:45AM by Elizabeth.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's Complicated sold out of its 80-book print run (like, I don't even have a copy myself any more sold out).

More people publishing games, whether free, print, ashcan, what have you. However, this is contrasted by...<br><br>2. Individual creators -- especially experienced ones -- taking longer to develop games or using alternative publishing models aside from the "print + GenCon + IPR" core strategy that was near universal until about 2006, when shifts seemed to begin. Things that support this: Ashcan Front, Vincent's recent games like Poison'd, Apocalypse World, Storming the Wizard's Tower, John Harper's free games, etc.  Also some experienced folks getting out of commercial publishing entirely like Clinton and Matt.  And some newer publishing agreements like what Evil Hat does for Penny for My Thoughts and Chad or what Cubicle 7 is gonna do for Gregor.<br><br>So it's not just that "the Golden Age is over."  The entire way we think about indie publishing now is pretty different now than it was circa 2004-2005, at least in a significant number of cases. Some of that is certainly a response to changing markets, but some of it is choices we made individually and negotiated collective choices.  <br><br>It's not too surprising, I don't think, that it's harder to move 1000 in two years not just because of increased competition but also increased ambivalence about convention presence or demos or distribution into game stores or all the things that I notice publishers being ambivalent about now. I'm not sure we have a better model for producing lots of sales that can replace "sell from my personal website" or "sell through IPR after debuting at GenCon" even if those models don't work as well as they previously did.  I'm not sure the next big publishing model has been stumbled upon yet, unless it's the Danger Patrol model, which hasn't come fully to fruition yet (though the amount of play the Alpha has seen is astounding and makes me optimistic) and isn't making John any money right now (though, eventually, perhaps).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230064/#Comment_230064" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T10:25:12+00:00" title="September  4, 2009 10:25AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</i> has sold 290 copies in two years, during which time I've largely neglected marketing it (two children under three can cause that).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230065/#Comment_230065" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T10:31:55+00:00" title="September  4, 2009 10:31AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1000 sales in two years?

I'm including both print and PDF sales, as the physical book has been out of print for awhile.<br/><br/>If the book hadn't fallen out of print---which occurred after (yikes!) 18-20 months---I *might* have sold 1000 by the 3-year mark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230066/#Comment_230066" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T10:42:24+00:00" title="September  4, 2009 10:42AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone should ask Jake Richmond for Panty Explosion/Classroom Deathmatch data, I remember it being fairly high.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230069/#Comment_230069" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T11:09:40+00:00" title="September  4, 2009 11:09AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric J.

However, there were a small number indie d20 publishers who, post glut but pre-4th ed, would break 1000 sales in a month, if you count print and .pdf. Some of these were based off of name recognition (Monte), others consistency of product, and so on. <br/><br/>(For the record, Church and State, which is for Mutants and Masterminds, sold something around 300 copies. But I was always small potatoes in the pool.)<br/><br/>I've no idea what that looks like now that 4th ed is out, mind you. <br/><br/>I also wonder about many of the old school renaissance games and what they're numbers look like. A lot of them are avaliable for free, so "sold" becomes an issue.... But its a market that I've got little information on and that we're not looking at very much here. (As this thread is more like "what games that we talk about regularly on story games sell more than 1000" and less like "what games published independently by the person who owns the game sell more than 1000.") <br/><br/>So... egh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230086/#Comment_230086" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T12:20:33+00:00" title="September  4, 2009 12:20PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>My understanding is that most people who have sold 1000+ indie RPGs:<br/><br/>- have a previously established reputation<br/>- built a community beforehand or around their game<br/>- license existing properties<br/>- work with known people or cross promote<br/>- service the RPG fan community in other ways first (podcasts for example)<br/>- make frequent convention appearances, run demos, lead seminars<br/>- help others in the community first or requently share their knowledge<br/>- winning awards<br/>- offer free product or services.<br/></blockquote>\nWhy on earth would anyone try to publish and market a game all by his lonesome without doing at least <i>some</i> of those?<br/><br/>The commerce of the hobby has, since its inception, been about word of mouth starting with direct designer-player contact.

It wasn't promoted at all before Gen Con 2009, and I didn't have any games on the market before that. I don't expect 1000 sales in two years, but I'll come close to it (including PDF sales, anyway).<br/><br/>My sales have come from these sources, in approximately equal proportions:<br/>* People in the extended indie community<br/>* People who obsessively scour the Internet for things related to the game's color<br/>* People who were marketed to, directly or indirectly, by me: Gen Con demos, the game\u2019s BoardGameGeek page, seeing it on RPG now, hearing me interviewed in a podcast (thanks, Rich!)<br/>* People who were "marketed" to by people who had already found my game: blog posts, forum posts, tweets and re-tweets, podcast mentions, and reviews<br/><br/>Over time, the latter two have grown in importance, but the first two remain significant factors. Of the people who bought it, I'd say half were attracted by the game itself (solo play, interesting mechanics, map enthusiasts and so on) and half were attracted by the color (old-school D&amp;D, dungeon enthusiasts).<br/><br/>So my totally wild guess is that an awesome indie game that comes from nowhere can realistically hope to sell 200 copies in two years.<br/>If there\u2019s a community out there beyond the indie crowd who are hungry for what your game delivers, that\u2019s good for another200.<br/>Marketing to that community is worth another 200 (though potentially less or much, much more depending who that community is).<br/>Having people in your target spread the word for you is worth another 200.<br/>That\u2019s 800 copies. <br/><br/>Ways to get more:<br/>* Find a bigger community that\u2019s hungry for your game. I\u2019ll bet Andy K and Tony LB have some thoughts on this. \uf04a<br/>* Market the hell out of your game.<br/>* Be lucky<br/><br/>All this is useless if you haven\u2019t yet asked *why* you want to sell 1000 copies. This is recipe for heartbreak if you fail to meet your goal, or if you meet your goal and find out that it doesn\u2019t actually make your life any better. On the other hand, there are lots of legitimate reasons to shoot for a high sales target as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230098/#Comment_230098" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T13:00:46+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  1:00PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we can pull Cold City off the list, not because it hasn't sold more than a grand (it has) but because a|state was already a big hit before (and sold over 1000 too). a|state had two ENnie nominations and a real presence in distro before Cold City rolled along.<br/><br/>Vincent, however, was not a big name before Dogs. I mean people didn't buy Dogs sight unseen just because it had "by DVB" on the cover. It made his rep in my opinion, though.<br/><br/>3:16 has done over 1500 for me (it went over a grand in six months, which is crazy - and it's past Cold City now) and DesignMatters has a strict "no demos" booth policy at GenCon (I like to mischievously call it an "AntiRob" policy). The game was easy to pick up and play, though, (and people did, which is awesome) but there was no marketing plan or demo support that drove sales of the book. My name was not worth a lot before that book came out. I guess Cubicle 7 putting it into distro will take it up a notch from there.<br/><br/>I remember meeting Fred and Rob at GenCon when Fred had DRYH on the LULU booth. They worked damn hard to promote their books and to make sure they were pretty hot too. Nothing dropped in their lap for those two books but they earned a great rep in doing them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230099/#Comment_230099" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T13:05:33+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  1:05PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Chad, when did T&amp;J release.

I suspect S7S will do pretty well. I don't yet own it myself, though I have looked it over quite a bit. It looked wonderful. (Thanks for the Nine Worlds nod, by the way.) <br/><br/>Gregor -- this may sound like a crazy question, and I don't mean it at all to be a confrontational one. But, did you have any inkling or plan that 3:16 would do that well? Because, that's EXTREMELY successful in comparison to, well, everyone else in this thread. <br/><br/>Now, I like the game a lot, and I thought it was clearly the big hit last year. I'm not terribly surprised to find out all this. I guess what I'm asking, though, is do you feel like you almost fell into that success? Again, no dig at you, and you deserve it for a great game.

What's the thought process behind that if you don't mind me asking?<br/><br/>This is a very interesting thread. It hits on a lot of things I've been talking about with some friends recently. I'm totally new to this. I've been on the boards for a while, but haven't really made a name for myself. <i>Chronica Feudalis</i> is starting to generate a bit of a following, but I've had to work for it over the course of its development and its various stages of being released. It started with the free playtest version, which garnered some very well-written blog posts that started to get the word out. So far the biggest factors for me selling books have been... <br/><br/>a) being on the front page of RPGNow<br/>b) running demos and having the book at the IPR booth at GenCon<br/>c) being on the front page of IPR (which is a bit of a waste at the moment because I've sold out of copies \u2014 that should be rectified soon) <br/><br/>I'm not really shooting for 1000+ sales in the near future. <i>Chronica Feudalis</i> targets a pretty small niche in a niche market in a niche industry. It does seem to get a pretty good reaction from anyone who actually picks it up and reads it. And the cover, I think, does a good job of getting people to pick it up \u2014 but the biggest hurdle is just getting the book in front of people's faces.<br/><br/>But all-in-all, I'm not looking to set any records with this book. While it's important to me, and I've put everything I have into it, it's ultimately a learning experience I'll use for the next one. And that one will be a learning experience for the one after that, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230109/#Comment_230109" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T14:17:26+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  2:17PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Gregor -- this may sound like a crazy question, and I don't mean it at all to be a confrontational one.

I didn't plan for or expect the sales 3:16 got at all. I wanted to do a print run of 316 copies and number them but I killed that idea as I didn't think it would be wise to print so many (WTF do I know?), so I did a print run of 200 which I thought would last me from August till at least Christmas. I ended up printing almost 1000 books before I got my first IPR payout. That could kill you if you don't have the money available to pay for those print runs up front. OneBookShelf paying monthly helped out. Getting a bonus from work in my July paypacket saved the day.<br/><br/>I caught lightning in a bottle in October 05 (and I knew it then before it got its Ronny) and I desperately did not want to fuck it up. When I finished the book in 08 I knew it was good and I was super happy with it. I would have been delighted to sell 200 books in 6 months knowing that it would have a long tail. I think that's a realistic way to go. Be ready to sell it to anyone that wants it but don't bet on everyone having the same taste as you.<br/><br/>The players will decide what they want to play and buy. I think the numbers in the 300s are great and anything north of that is super.<br/><br/>Oh, it doesn't hurt that I'm amiable at cons and schmooze around but I don't think that sells many copies of a game. Maybe they look at it because of that, sure, but only a handful of people buy an awful book because a pal wrote it. And I know too many good people with good books that don't get the sales those things deserve (Nine Worlds, Contenders, Annalise anyone?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230112/#Comment_230112" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T14:35:31+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  2:35PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Beast Hunters</i> sold, uhm... about 400 by now since its release in April 2007.

DoN did well out of the demoing but it deserved better - it's a great game.<br><br>Most famously (?) John Harper played or GMed in something like 15 missions over the con. Ben in Seattle was the dude that introduced John to the game in the weeks prior to the con. The game I played with Harper was actually at the end of the con and was me introducing him to my Seattle buddies Shannon (who then became Lady Blackbird) and Paul (Snargle).<br/><br/>Steve Segedy and Eero amongst others ran it too, so it was getting played a hell of a lot. I don't see how you can plan for that to happen "spontaneously" though. I do know that Dread (jenga) gets crazy amounts of play from enthusiastic lovers of the game and that keeps it evergreen in sales. So having the game played and enjoyed helps tremendously.

I was whining that the printer I was excited about working with would only print 200 copies minimum and he was like "Jonathan, you can sell 200 copies in the first 6 months, no problem."  But the experience of folks like Nathan and Matt -- with products that they know are good and their friends and fellow designers think are good -- makes me wonder how anyone goes about predicting what does and doesn't work in this market.  I still think 200 is a good number to start with, for most people.  Aim for selling 200 your first year and then be pleasantly surprised if it moves like hotcakes.  Or take pre-orders if you're worried about a situation like Gregor's, where you're not necessarily prepared to front the bill for 1000 copies (though, only take pre-orders once you have a print-ready PDF and a sample back from the printer, not before).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230121/#Comment_230121" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T15:43:10+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  3:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>[..]makes me wonder how anyone goes about predicting what does and doesn't work in this market.</blockquote>\nYou don't.<br/>There are plenty of people writing about how skill has very little to do with success, say, in writing, and luck (or zeitgeist) have so much more.<br/>Let's say "Skill" is a required condition, but it's far from sufficient.<br/><br/>If you do everything in the list provided by John above, it can help, but "predict"?

Kill some aliens, have some fun adventures. carry, on the other hand, is wonderful but more serious. I played a game of carry at GenCon that strayed towards Tropic Thunder territory (sorry Adam, who ran it, and Nathan). <br/><br/>Basically, 3:16 can be played at Embassay Suites with a beer at midnight on Saturday. carry perhaps not so much.<br/><br/>Do games that stay closer to standard gaming tropes sell better? I feel like 3:16 has a lot of appeal to more traditional gamers, since it non-ironically relies on combat and getting cooler gear, which most gamers understand.

I was whining that the printer I was excited about working with would only print 200 copies minimum and he was like "Jonathan, you can sell 200 copies in the first 6 months, no problem."  But the experience of folks like Nathan and Matt -- with products that they know are good and their friends and fellow designers think are good -- makes me wonder how anyone goes about predicting what does and doesn't work in this market.  I still think 200 is a good number to start with, for most people.  Aim for selling 200 your first year and then be pleasantly surprised if it moves like hotcakes.  Or take pre-orders if you're worried about a situation like Gregor's, where you're not necessarily prepared to front the bill for 1000 copies (though, only take pre-orders once you have a print-ready PDF and a sample back from the printer, not before).</blockquote>\nYou're right. No one can predict. Why, with It's Complicated, a good friend told me not to print more than 40 copies-- and even when I doubled his estimate, I've been sold out for a year and change.

He made such a staggeringly beautiful object that people all felt like they were getting a great deal. And they were! He made it good in every respect for his design parameters.</p>\n<p>He continues to experiment with pricing, licensing, and his own investment. That's how you sell in volume: make a thing as well as you can that reaches a particular group of potential enthusiasts, then invest your energy to whatever degree is appropriate (given your publication goals and limitations) into reaching those people. Be personable, be excited. If you can't find those people, can't invest enough energy, can't maintain your own enthusiasm in the face of bullshit, and can't make something beautiful and good, you <em>won't</em> succeed.</p>\n<p>Shit, look at Eclipse Phase.

It's sold relatively few there compared to its overall sales. So nothing under Mouse Guard has come anywhere close to selling 1000 copies through IPR. IPR does not, therefore, represent overall sales for a game. <br/><br/>Many of the small press standouts and stalwarts are absent from that list as well:<br/>Sorcerer -- the uncle of top-selling small press RPGs<br/>Riddle of Steel -- I'm fairly certain Jake burned through just over a thousand before he opted out<br/>My Life with Master -- never been near a fulfillment house but it has a strong history of sales<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard -- probably the first breakout indie darling. I think Vincent sold 700 in his first year. He can correct me if I'm wrong.<br/>And dear old Burning Wheel -- which is currently headed into its 4th printing and has never been sold as a pdf (this doesn't include original Burning Wheel). We sold 286 our first year with none of Ben's qualification list in play. <br/><br/>So IPR's list is faulty because it omits five the all time top sellers and does not include total sales data for the games it does include. It's just a list of games that sell well on IPR -- and nothing more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230272/#Comment_230272" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-06T08:20:03+00:00" title="September  6, 2009  8:20AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Diaspora's first month is complete and our numbers look like:<br/><br/>100 non-author Lulu sales<br/>6 direct sales to B&amp;M<br/><br/>Another B&amp;M deal is in the works.

There've been long and short threads here and elsewhere about the game or about things related to the game. That's about the extent of the marketing. Our two biggest sales humps were: release and my post here about Diaspora morsels (lightly particpated in here but highly linked by fans to elsewhere). Keeping the game info active at <a href="http://rpg.geekdo.com" rel="nofollow">RPGGeek (GeekDo)</a> has been pretty powerful as well -- the "Hotness" list is scored by activity on the RPG item, so if you use your item entry to post news and if fans chatter there too (each item has a subforum) then you score highly on the Hotness and stay constantly visible on the front page of that site. The short version is, active engagement with the community. That's my zero-risk approach. I don't expect massive returns for it and I don't project 100 sales/month on the strength of the first month (25% of sales occurred before I woke up after pressing GO at Lulu the night before and posted to the mailing list).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230279/#Comment_230279" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-06T09:25:51+00:00" title="September  6, 2009  9:25AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not my list, it's John's list.

The positive view of it is that the market for RPGs is vast, even amongst people who already RPGs. COPs, (and other small RPG publishers) simply aren't succesfully reaching those people - but the opportunity is there. That's entirely apart from all the other people who would really enjoy these games but simply haven't heard of them.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, there's no particular reason why people have to create games and then ensure as many people play them as possible. But I love our tiny hobby, but would like to see it grow. The fact that sales of all COPs and small press RPGs are probably 1% of all sales of RPGs, which is an even tinier proportion of the games market, which is a small portion of the leisure market is depressing, but at least we aren't saturing the potential market!<br/><br/>I do think indie games have a disproportionate influence on main stream games, which is a good thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, sorry, I'm veering off topic.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230378/#Comment_230378" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T08:20:16+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  8:20AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>I do think indie games have a disproportionate influence on main stream games, which is a good thing.</blockquote>\nYeah, I definitely think that's become increasingly apparent in recent years, both from shifts in mainstream RPGs and indie games consistently being nominated for Diana Jones and other awards given by cabals of game designers.

This is an analogy rather than a direct comparison!<br/><br/>Edit: One place where the analogy falls down a little is that the mainstream in RPGs requires more effort to learn than many of the indie games. If you had to hand an RPG to an adult who had never played RPGs, it probably wouldn't be GURPs or 4e.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AdamK" title="AdamK"><img alt="AdamK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AdamK">AdamK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230396/#Comment_230396" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T09:56:57+00:00" title="September  7, 2009  9:56AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan P.</cite><br/>That's what you get for wanting Jared's games.

That's why IPR is (was?) a good place for me. I'm aware of the fact that shipping to my place is a major pain in the ass for anyone in the world - it's a big show-stopper for most online orders - but IPR handled that professionally, with one big package and reasonable pricing for a stack of books. You can't do that for one book as you can't swallow the cost of shipping to here from overseas and I won't pay $35-40 for a $20 product - which is kind of a mental block from my side you can't do anything against.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230399/#Comment_230399" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-07T10:16:24+00:00" title="September  7, 2009 10:16AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam: very fair point.

Customizable RPG and Heroes Forever each sold over 1000 copies. But to be fair, they were all also released during a "different time" within the industry. 1998, 1997 and 1999 respectively. A lot has changed since then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dark Realms had one printing of about 2200 books, which sold about 1600 of those before going into fire sale and liquidation type sales. A couple hundred ultimately went to con prizes and other give-away type thingys.<br/>\n<br/>\nW.H.A.T.? began with a photo copy run of 50. Started slowly sales wise, but after a couple of years and 14 follow up products, it had entered distribution substantially and sold through about 7000 copies before eventually being taken out of print. Originally with the intent to upgrade the game line past the pamphlet style books it had back then, then we failed to bring it back before it lost its momentum. We're still planning a relaunch (and soon), but have some odd duck marketing and distribution plans for it, so are still piecing together that particular puzzle. Its been out of print about 5 years now, officially.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeroes Forever had a substantial (for a small press) print run of covers made originally, but its interiors were always done in house in small run/pod fashion. Its nearly complete with its first run of covers (4000 of them) but I couldn't actually tell you how many "printings" that worked out to. Somewhere between 400 and 200 books per run.<br/>\n<br/>\nDark Realms rans its first 1000 within its first year. W.H.A.T.? did not, but was running substantially over 1000 a year at its peak. Heroes Forever "may" have hit 1000 after 2 years, but I kind of doubt it. It had an initial strong surge of sales into the distribution channels, then nearly died off without distribution, then has been slowly climbing back up in sales figures each year since shifting to a direct model.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyways, I would say that any pre 2002 being compared to anything post 2002, or thererabouts anyway, is an apples to oranges comparison anyways. Because the industry really began to change at that time as did how small/indie companies produced and distributed their goods.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.
