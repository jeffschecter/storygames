The express purpose of the OSR is to return to the roots of the hobby. The people who are part of the OSR don't want to play other games - at least not when they're playing D&amp;D. I am a silent observer in the OSR community, and while they are often receptive to other games, but their heart is with the dungeon crawl. They love D&amp;D: its tropes, the plentiful content to draw from, the simple mechanics, the focus on exploration and high lethality.<br/><br/>Kevin Crawford is a bit of an innovator when it comes to the OSR; he has a knack for crafting new mechanics that work well enough with the old.<br/><br/>To answer your question:\n<blockquote> Wouldn\u2019t it be possible to explore how to deliver on the Old School ideas and values through new and accessible designs, without the shackles of old forms and archaic techniques?</blockquote>\nYes. But there's not a game that does this yet. Dungeon World does it half-heartedly (World of Dungeons is a better game, I think), and Torchbearer is...well, it's so mechanized and heavy, and the role of the GM is almost automated. The OSR has at its core the "fiction first" mentality, even if they don't quite have the words to describe it.<br/><br/>Now, you might ask how this can be ported to a more modern design. \n<blockquote> A TL:DR version of all this could read like this:<br/><br/>    the dungeon is a puzzle, an exercise in fictional problem solving<br/>    the players, not the characters, try to solve it with their personal experience and ingenuity<br/>    the characters are just avatars allowing the players to interact with the imagined ambient of the dungeon; at best they represent specialized tools<br/>    thespian interpretation of a role (aka roleplaying) is fun and welcome but ultimately should not interfere with the adventuring<br/>    \u201cstory\u201d is a byproduct of adventuring, not the main goal of play<br/>    dice rolls (combat, skills, etc) are statistically dangerous, a smart player avoids them at all costs<br/></blockquote>\nWhat exactly are you looking to modernize with regard to this? As far as I can tell, the OSR just needs a very good set of GM guidelines to make the game work. When you say:\n<blockquote>Wouldn\u2019t it be possible to explore how to deliver on the Old School ideas and values through new and accessible designs, without the shackles of old forms and archaic techniques?</blockquote>\nI'm not sure what you're looking for. Can you explain exactly what you're looking to update or refine?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465301/#Comment_465301" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-03T15:22:38+00:00" title="August  3, 2017  3:22PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\u201cFirst there is the vast amount of retro-clones.

The various republications and rehashes do not, generally, revolutionarize the textual culture.<br/><br/>They also are only moderately innovative regarding the substance of play, which does indicate that people are generally happy with D&amp;D as it is. This does not surprise me, as it's an amazingly expansive game with unique methodology; one of the few games of the 20th century that will last the test of time. (Not necessarily the dungeons and dragons bit, that's just the milieu - I'm talking about the actual game activity.) One might as well ask why Chess players don't reinvent Chess all the time as ask why D&amp;D players generally are happy to continue exploring D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I think that people generally feel pretty free about writing the kinds of texts they find necessary and interesting. In this regard the answer to the challenge is probably that the OSR scene collectively don't see the need for the kind of innovation you mean. Or rather, they seem satisfied with leaving the innovation in the blogosphere; I think that just about everything that one can say about the basic theory of D&amp;D has been said at some point by somebody. There's just no motivation to productize the knowledge, people seem satisfied with mentoring and long-term discourse as the main ways the game is transmitted. Rules texts come a distant third after personal instruction (within specific campaign context) and Internet journalling/discussion.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465305/#Comment_465305" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-03T16:23:22+00:00" title="August  3, 2017  4:23PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's rather dismissive to say that "there's really almost no roleplaying in this style." Every decision made within the dungeon is a matter of roleplaying; it is, however, a matter of a very specific style of roleplaying. The player characters are taking on the roles of adventurers in a hostile, dangerous environment where every decision can make the difference between life and death. The term "fantasy Vietnam" is used for a reason, and one might liken the adventurers to a platoon of soldiers. One can quibble about whether this is "real roleplaying" because it does not flesh out individual characters with flaws, beliefs, foibles, etc. (characters with flaws tend to end up dead), but I would say that it is surely roleplaying, even if one could mark it as "rudimentary."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465307/#Comment_465307" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-03T22:00:51+00:00" title="August  3, 2017 10:00PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MOD VOICE:<br/><br/>I don't know: I don't feel strongly enough about it to immediately close this thread, and I am open to thoughts and feedback, but I feel like the article is strong in two narratives I think are poor fits for this board (and personally dislike too!):<br/><br/>1) Roleplaying design is on some continuum of progress, and just so handily, it turns out story games/freeform/whatever-you-like is more advanced<br/>2) X gaming style isn't roleplaying, or it's a more 'basic' form of roleplaying.<br/><br/>So my intuition is that this is a bad thread for the board, since it's about categorizing and diminishing other people's experiences. <br/><br/>But I will leave this open for now in case I am being too jumpy here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465311/#Comment_465311" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-04T06:36:25+00:00" title="August  4, 2017  6:36AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" rel="nofollow">James_Stuart</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>So my intuition is that this is a bad thread for the board, since it's about categorizing and diminishing other people's experiences. <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nUsually this kind of discussions have not ended well.

I think all of these are false claims.<br/><br/>As for bringing in new people, many of the OSR enthusiasts I know in real life are reasonably young, like less than thirty years old. Many teens enjoy playing in the old school way.<br/><br/>Next, let us consider presentation of information. There are people who faithfully reproduce the old presentation, and there are people who do weird art (Fire on the velvet horizon by Scrap princess is often mentioned; here's a teaser: <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-85nfi_UapSA/VPapOmwivAI/AAAAAAAAI8w/38rVwkxi29E/s1600/flammeous%2Blads.JPG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-85nfi_UapSA/VPapOmwivAI/AAAAAAAAI8w/38rVwkxi29E/s1600/flammeous+lads.JPG</a> ), and there are people who at least try to work on design and usability (Maze of the blue medusa is often mentioned; for example <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ms08NUlbHpM/VwIln3TsAqI/AAAAAAAAbWk/1FY5w1af2cg2msyJMLMlvY3pJne50mpcw/s1600/maze_preview_3.tiff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ms08NUlbHpM/VwIln3TsAqI/AAAAAAAAbWk/1FY5w1af2cg2msyJMLMlvY3pJne50mpcw/s1600/maze_preview_3.tiff</a> ). I'm sure someone who is more interested in these matters can give more examples. But both of these are quite different in presentation from the old material, so people are not simply copying the old methods.<br/><br/>Next, let us consider fictional content. Check pretty much anything by Lamentation of the flame princess, maybe excluding some of the oldest content. The doom cave of crystal-headed children is free, for example: <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/132808/The-DoomCave-of-the-CrystalHeaded-Children" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpgnow.com/product/132808/The-DoomCave-of-the-CrystalHeaded-Children</a> . It is not exactly similar to the oldest of D&amp;D material. Likewise, Maze of the blue medusa has a couple of classical elements, but also plenty of interesting fictional content. See also, for example: <a href="http://goblinpunch.blogspot.fi/2014/09/false-hydra.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://goblinpunch.blogspot.fi/2014/09/false-hydra.html</a><br/>In fact, I suspect that OSR produces much more interesting fictional content than most other design traditions, simply because it focuses on publishing adventures and there is much more creative freedom than with publishers stuck to a well-defined setting. Also, there are bestiaries.<br/><br/>Next, let us consider other kinds of game design.<br/>Into the odd is mechanically quite distinct from D&amp;D; there are no attack rolls in combat, for example, unlike in almost every traditional roleplaying game ever published.<br/>The rules for prophecy, maybe in Vornheim: "Nobody will believe you when you bring dire news, leading to destruction of a city" is handled so that either the player or the referee can evoke it when it fits the fictional situation, and then it happens and the prophecy is no more.<br/>The rules for fear, in Maze of the blue medusa: When you tell what your character is doing, the referee has a couple of seconds during which to come up with an alternate bad idea; if they do, then your character does that instead.<br/>Scenic Dunnsmouth is an adventure creation methodology; it creates variations of a village with hidden horrors. I am not personally familiar with this, so please find reviews if interested.<br/>The encumbrance rules in Lamentations of the flame princess are quite streamlined, while still requiring decisions from players and remaining quite faithful to the fiction.<br/>The rules for factions in Stars without number.<br/><br/>Next, let us consider the amount of guidance the referee gets. Many of the books are quite bad at this, and most of the information is indeed word-of-mouth and blog posts. Some exceptions: Lamentations of the flame princess referee book (and maybe tutorial book and intro adventure; I haven't read those), Into the Odd (I think, it has been a while), even the mediocre primer to old school gaming. Someone is also writing this text: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zk9G5m0sHDvkDto3iITfJKacINYa_TAPxuStYaaZ_FA/edit#heading=h.4xkr4pbz0bnu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zk9G5m0sHDvkDto3iITfJKacINYa_TAPxuStYaaZ_FA/edit#heading=h.4xkr4pbz0bnu</a><br/>The refereeing methodology and philosophy are widely known, so the theory is there, but few have written it down in published books.<br/>I am not aware of player-facing texts, but they are also quite rare in other design traditions.<br/>You may wish to compare this situation to Dungeon world and the surrounding explanatory literature, and people often try to use it wrong in spite of this. For almost all games, the way people learn it is by playing and then discussing what went wrong with other people. (I am continuously surprised by this; why not first read and then use what you read? I suspect most people are simply very bad at reading.)<br/><br/>Next, let us also consider the theory and design community. Most of the major aspects of old school play are understood quite well, and you pretty much always can find an explanation, and also someone doing the thing differently. For example: Combat system, hit points, referee, dungeon map design, experience from treasure, encumbrance, why attack bonuses advance and AC does not, thief skills, caller, players mapping.<br/><br/><br/>After all this, Hasimir, I can see two possible conclusions. Either you are not very familiar with the innovative side of OSR (maybe you mostly follow Dragonsfoot or Knights and Knaves or something like that), or you have a significantly different understanding of what is new, interesting, and design.<br/><br/>Supposing my examples are trivial to you, could you point out what counts as new and interesting developments in some other genre of design, such as PbtA games, classic Forge games (by which I means games where the following are typical features: shared narration, focused premise, formal rules) or "traditional games" (Runequest, GURPS, Praedor, etc; characters with lots of moving parts, players restricted to their character, rules which simulate the fictional reality, combat system more involved than other subsystems).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465314">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465314/#Comment_465314" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-04T09:51:39+00:00" title="August  4, 2017  9:51AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>D&amp;D and the OSR has produced some of the most innovative and <em>functional</em> design this hobby has ever seen.</p>\n<div>It\u2019s driven by actual play and testing.<br/>It\u2019s made with \u201cusable at the table\u201d in mind.<br/>It has revolutionized the GM\u2019s role and responsibilities.</div>\n<p>It invented the idea of a roleplaying game.

Roll under vs over? Linear vs curve? Pool vs one roll? etc etc. <strong><em>Because that was all we had</em></strong> when it came to design. It\u2019s so short-sighted. It\u2019s like arguing over what text editor to use instead of actually writing.</p>\n<p>Game design, and emergent play, is about so much more. Using the boring old six stats and the d20 and the AC/HP etc\u2026 they <em>work</em>, they get the job done, they\u2019re familiar via pop culture, they\u2019re open source, and we have so much more to focus on. I can understand the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?NotInventedHere" rel="nofollow">NIH</a> impulse but go make amazing dungeon, amazing setting, modern day city, or isolated urban cottage, or 1930:s California suburb family drama, or 2090:s chempunk soap opera, or a new way to format adventures, dungeons, generate characters and relationships, or, or\u2026</p>\n<p>Are there bad games in the OSR? Heck yes, I could rant for a while on one of my pet flogging horses, The Black Hack (I can understand why it\u2019s a darling to so many, it\u2019s a concise, physically beautiful, graphically usable, innovative game book but there\u2019s some <em>bad</em> design in there, like usage dice + the things Hasimir describes about L\u2019Ultima Torcia). But, again, it\u2019s Sturgeon\u2019s Law. <a href="http://fictioneers.net/games" rel="nofollow">10%, at most, of these games good,</a> and the same goes for the OSR.</p>\n<p>A thread like this isn\u2019t going to foster good design. It\u2019s just going to foster hostility.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465317/#Comment_465317" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-04T11:38:06+00:00" title="August  4, 2017 11:38AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hasimir, I think you need to play and read more OSR games.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465318/#Comment_465318" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-04T11:40:04+00:00" title="August  4, 2017 11:40AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">@Thanuir</a> for sharing thoughts and experiences, as well as a lot of the exciting stuff going on in OSR today (I'm personally a huge fan of the Patrick Stuart/ Scrap Princess collaborations).
