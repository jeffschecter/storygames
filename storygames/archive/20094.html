Classic fantasy tropes, or nativism vs European, or ... ? How much tactical combat do you want? Is the game about "just getting through my fucking tour, man" or is it about the higher level strategy and conflict of civilizations and ideas in a more literal sense than usual?<br/><br/>For example, if you wanted to go <i>very</i> classic, mechanically, there's a supplement for <b>D&amp;D 4th</b> called <b><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/58595/Wraith-Recon" rel="nofollow">Wraith Recon</a></b> which wears its influences on its sleeve, right alongside the rank insignia, but which would work really well for folks very used to the standard GM'd game architecture. Not sure if 4th counts as "light crunch," realistically, but for some it is. Not my personal choice to run, but I love it for the setting content; inspirational at worst.<br/><br/>If it were me, and I was putting together some prefab blocks to explore very traditional Western fantasy-style Wizards and Warlocks plopped down into Vietnam as part of a dirty, grinding war, I might break out my copies of Two-Hour Wargames' <b><a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/wahele.html" rel="nofollow">Warrior Heroes: Legends</a></b>, for the sorcery,  alongside <b><a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/fng.html" rel="nofollow">FNG</a></b> for the blood-and-guts of platoon command in the jungles. The magic system would probably need a little angle grinding in places, but that's inevitable for this sort of thing. When you're done, you'd have something you can play solo, co-op, or head-to-head and get a sweet mechanical system that can handle up to Company level command without too much work. (If you just want to check out the core mechanics, <a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/free.html" rel="nofollow">THW puts out two books for free that cover both the modern and the fantasy cores</a>. If you're enthusiastic enough, you could build straight off those.)<br/><br/>That covers the tactical, crunchy, it's-a-damn-war side of things were I going to do it from that side.<br/><br/>Switching things around, if you're looking to focus on the meta-text as much as the text, <b><a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/pta.html" rel="nofollow">Primetime Adventures</a></b> released their latest edition recently, and if the structure of story-series like <b><a href="http://www.hbo.com/band-of-brothers#/" rel="nofollow">Band of Brothers</a></b> appeals to you, it's worth taking a look at. It's structured around the idea of TV-series-as-structural-guide, so characters have more or less mechanical influence as their importance to the season arc waxes and wanes, which is kind of a cool thing. It;'s traditionally GM-full, which you might groove to, or not.<br/><br/>Now, to switch to the other, other, <i>other</i> side of game design which only has a nodding acquaintance with what people know as such, there's <b><a href="http://www.lamemage.com/kingdom/" rel="nofollow">Kingdom</a></b>, by the same guy that wrote <b><a href="http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/" rel="nofollow">Microscope</a></b>. In Kingdom, you play a singular character who's part of a larger, interdependent social group of at least 50 -- like a reinforced infantry company with cross-attached experimental sorcery support squads. Characters take on the narrative-influencing roles of Power (who make decisions for the whole group), Perspective (who can narrate the outcome of decisions made by the Power), or Touchstone (who says what the members of the group think about what's going on). The whole thing becomes a ballet of trading ideas and both subtle competition and cooperation to get what your character wants, avoid what they fear, and to keep the Kingdom from falling into crises. It's pretty awesome stuff. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojJO4eM6gn4&amp;list=PL6A7E9AE395D8C3EF&amp;index=41" rel="nofollow">My group and I've liked it enough to do several live plays of it on YouTube</a>.<br/><br/>But -- yeah, all that stuff is cool, but how do <i>you</i> see the game you want to play actually playing out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_444134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444134/#Comment_444134" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-16T21:34:15+00:00" title="March 16, 2015  9:34PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars</i><br/><br/>Magical/Non-Magical Ability.<br/><br/>Hatred for...

The Fate stuff will scale reasonably for mass combat.<br/><br/>Or use the Carry RPG (officially, "carry: a game about war") and add the magic purely as color. It's a Vietnam game that divides game play between combat and non-combat, but the combat isn't crunchy. It's very light and is more about fictional position and whether or not you follow orders. It will REALLY help you get into the Vietnam War tropes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
