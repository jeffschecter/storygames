We gathered many authors to discuss and push analog game development forward and many incredible initiatives started to appear all around our country. So now I decided to write about all this creative movement... in English.<br/><br/>The Analog XP will be a free online magazine about all that is happening around here, with articles, event coverage, interviews, and every issue will contain a full game translated to English. We have tons of material to show you, so this is going to be really fun! To fund all the work involved in creating this content I started a Patreon: <a href="http://www.patreon.com/encho" rel="nofollow">patreon.com/encho</a>. So if you really liked this idea, I'll be honored to have you as my patron.<br/><br/>This is going to be our first issue cover:<br/><img alt="image" height="550" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/patreon/7b9aaa722726e41cdeea25245877c2cc.jpg" width="400"/><br/><br/><br/>Thanks for your attention! I believe you will enjoy it a lot!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/encho" title="encho"><img alt="encho" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/865/nX2S8228S8WLE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/encho">encho</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433773/#Comment_433773" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-13T07:08:03+00:00" title="June 13, 2014  7:08AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi everyone!
