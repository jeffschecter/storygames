When in doubt, go with the obvious. Everyone here comes from a different place with different life experiences. What seems obvious to one person is usually surprising to the rest of us.<br/><br/>We\u2019re In This Together<br/>We\u2019ve all got something really valuable we can give each other, our curiosity. If someone says something you don\u2019t quite get, or you\u2019re having a hard time picturing what someone is talking about, be curious about it. Ask questions, draw them out. They are saying it because it is important to them somehow and it is our job to coax those ideas out into the air.<br/> <br/>Respect the Veil<br/>The Veil is a safety mechanism, its the emergency break. Storytelling is powerful stuff and you might be taken off guard by the emotions or investment you feel in our story. Pay attention to your personal boundaries.   If something happens at the table that approaches or crosses those boundaries, ask for it to be veiled, and we\u2019ll skip it, no questions asked. The veil also carries the understanding the when someone requests to veil  something you\u2019ve said or contributed to the story, this doesn\u2019t make you are a bad person.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty" title="Sliberty"><img alt="Sliberty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty">Sliberty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354248/#Comment_354248" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T14:16:27+00:00" title="January 14, 2012  2:16PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You must be playing some intense games!

I have certainly noticed people overthinking at the table or becoming so caught up in cleverness that they overlook the obvious.

Like, I get that Ross wants these to be straight from the beginning, but does that mean I should mention them before we play? Do I read this section out loud first?<br/><br/>Maybe "there are a few things I want <i>everybody</i> to get straight from the beginning."<br/><br/>Also maybe "to understand right from the beginning." In my own language usage, a term like "let's get this straight," is usually reserved for an antagonistic stance. I don't know that I'd feel comfortable using it with people I was about to play hippy, no-tough-guy-bullshit story games with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354262/#Comment_354262" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T15:47:41+00:00" title="January 14, 2012  3:47PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, the veil is a metaphor.

For me, I feel like I'll never really know that unless I make it clear to people at the start of the game that they have that power. I'm worried that if I don't do that, they'll not say anything and just be uncomfortable. There is another way to veil something you're uncomfortable with, and that is to stop coming to game night.  <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">@Johnstone</a> Awesome,  I agree with you about the introduction. For The Veil, I could also see how that could be a problem, this is more or less the speech I give every week at SG-Oly, I THINK everyone gets it but I should ask some newcomers to be sure.<br/><br/>thanks for the feedback both of you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
