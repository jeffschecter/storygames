Let me say, first of all, that I understand that random message board people are no replacement for true legal counsel. I'm just trying to get a bunch of semi-educated opinions about this topic.<br/><br/>In the game, players use cards drawn at random from several decks to inspire romantic crossover stories about their favorite fictional characters. Think Batman/Walter White slash fiction, but with randomly generated story elements and a Cards Against Human/Apples to Apples style scoring system.<br/><br/>Players can choose any popular fictional characters, and we won't be including the names of major characters from copyrighted works on the cards, though we might mention them in passing in the game text.<br/><br/>However, one of the decks contains Fiction Cards that allude to popular fictional works, either directly or indirectly.<br/><br/>These cards basically fall into three categories:<br/><br/>1. Cards that reference the source material obliquely in a way that fans would catch, but that don't reference any source-specific characters, settings, or items directly (ex: "Discovering a Mysterious Implant After Your Abduction" is an X-Files reference, but it could also be referring to a bunch of lesser known alien abduction stories).<br/><br/>2. Cards that don't directly name drop anything from the fiction, but that are very obviously referring to a particular fictional source (ex: "Hunting Demons in a Classic Car to Classic Rock" is obviously the premise of Supernatural.)<br/><br/>3. Cards that didn't name drop something specific to a fictional source (ex: "A Sonic Screwdriver Malfunction" could only be a Doctor Who reference, since the sonic screwdriver is a high profile item from that show's world).<br/><br/>Which of these three types of cards do you think would be kosher? All? None?<br/><br/>If it makes a difference, the game is designed to be a parody of fan fiction, and all of the stories generated will necessarily mix and match elements from different sources. So it'd be impossible to use the game to, say, create a retelling of or a sequel to one of the Harry Potter novels. But I also know that just blanketly throwing the word "parody" at something isn't a magical incantation against copyright violation.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435148/#Comment_435148" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-11T07:46:07+00:00" title="July 11, 2014  7:46AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might want to get in touch with the folks behind <a href="http://slashcg.com/" rel="nofollow">Slash</a>, as I'm sure they wound up grappling with these issues (and dropped a lot of specific references).<br/><br/>I would say that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> are very well-established as ways of skirting copyright. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is commonly called "X with the serial numbers filed off".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435149/#Comment_435149" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-11T07:51:17+00:00" title="July 11, 2014  7:51AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, slash has a lot of overlap with our idea, so this question may be moot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435151">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435151/#Comment_435151" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-11T08:03:46+00:00" title="July 11, 2014  8:03AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bet you could find ways to diverge it.
