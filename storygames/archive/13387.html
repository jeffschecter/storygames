And all the monsters you fight are basically your self-doubt, regret, and other emotions. You don't even really fight them, all the skills and magic powers you have are basically to protect your psyche against their damage, to push them back, to resist, etc. The setting is some kind of weird half-fantastical nordic setting.<br/><br/>I really can't wholeheartedly recommend it at this point, because again it's not everyone's speed (the action is a little too clicky/slow for me, I'll see as I continue through the game), but what I see really interests me. Not sure that I would even want to do this kind of thing for a tabletop RPG, but to see a really tactical "battle game" where the objective is to outmaneuver your internal fears and doubts which attack you, by using magical abilities like "Create Imaginary Friend" and "Acceptance".<br/><br/>Weird, kinda cool, very cool visuals and music, slow-paced.<br/><br/>Look for "Winter Voices" on Steam, or here's a few links:<br/><br/>Trailer: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/video/72900/5964" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://store.steampowered.com/video/72900/5964</a><br/><br/>Episode 1 (Prologue; I'm playing this now in bits and pieces) <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/72900/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://store.steampowered.com/app/72900/</a><br/><br/>Episode 2: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/72902/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://store.steampowered.com/app/72902/</a><br/><br/>The official website with screenshots:  <a href="http://www.wintervoices.com/arts" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wintervoices.com/arts</a><br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
