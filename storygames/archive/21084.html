This is assuming that the vast majority of these threads go uncommented; obviously threads that engage the community are fine.<br/><br/>I personally feel it's a little spammy, but I'm happy to defer to whatever the prevailing mood is.<br/><br/>EDIT: As an addendum, just want to say that I have no animus towards any podcast creators about this.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" title="Peter_Perry"><img alt="Peter_Perry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">Peter_Perry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462481/#Comment_462481" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T11:38:45+00:00" title="April 26, 2017 11:38AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not a single thread for each podcast? They could just post a new podcast episode in the same thread, keeping everything tight and no spam. For example, all Discern Realities episodes from The Gauntlet in the same thread, all +1 Forward episodes from The Gauntlet in another thread, etc. That would keep things nice and tidy. A thread for each episode would be way too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462488/#Comment_462488" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T13:56:55+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  1:56PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2017 10:23PM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a listener I've got to say that I'm pretty happy that they do so at the current rate. It's easier to find new episodes than if they were hidden in one thread\u2014 like YDMIAI who often uses very different kinds of games. For me, the current practice is useful.<br/><br/>Every episode can have its own discussion for example.<br/><br/>However, they tend to be very drive-by-ish. They post their link \u2014 perhaps automatically \u2014 and leave. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/><br/><br/>I can easily see the slippery slope if it gets out of hand.<br/>Not sure!<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> Kinda changed my mind since wrote the above. yukamichi has good points                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462515/#Comment_462515" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-26T20:59:57+00:00" title="April 26, 2017  8:59PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to think that if someone's threads advertising their podcast (or anything else) routinely generate no discussion that they would either actively attempt to foster some, or else "get the point" (or maybe have somebody politely give it to them) and stop posting every time they release something new.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of heavy-handed moderation but I also don't really like drive-by promotion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems" title="kyleweems"><img alt="kyleweems" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/856/nI5M0EM1PN1HG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kyleweems">kyleweems</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462516/#Comment_462516" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-27T00:35:37+00:00" title="April 27, 2017 12:35AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the one hand, it's hard to learn about casts to listen to if they never mention them.
