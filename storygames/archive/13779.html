The first is that Kickstarter takes a modest cut (~5%?) of the total funding so you do loose out on a bit of money sent to you that way.   The second disadvantage is that it does not currently allow you to directly create projects unless you have a US bank account which can interfere with the international participation to some extent.<br/><br/>The challenges include choosing a minimum total amount that is low enough to be met, yet high enough to get maximum participation.  This can be done effectively by offering supplemental prizes or content for ever X amount beyond the minimum.   The other challenge is to have the correct number of tiers for your audiences, with each tier offering different yet appropriate prizes.  This is great for pre-orders and can easily allow you to provide X numbers of copies to a customer for a certain pledge.  Telling them that a $75 pledge can get them 5 copies of your $20 retail book can do wonders.<br/><br/>Advantages include an easy method of tracking pre-orders, acquiring customers from different communities (such as the artist or patron of the arts communities) which may discover you via Kickstarter and a risk free method of fund-raising.  I am personally intending on using a Kickstarter for my own game project, <br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311830/#Comment_311830" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T05:45:12+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  5:45AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like most of the kickstarting projects I've seen have videos.

It helps to make the smallest financial contributions as low as possible without hurting your cause so if I'm 50/50 about your project but I do find it interesting, I can donate $5 to help in a small way. But also provide lots of benefits that scale upwards and are limited in some way. Here is a great example: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamingpaper/gaming-paper-adventures" rel="nofollow">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamingpaper/gaming-paper-adventures</a>. I would also recommend rewarding people who help promote you and spread the word (tracking and rewarding twitter mentions for example). <br/><br/>But bottom line, I don't think I've personally seen many kickstarters that have succeeded that didn't already have some sort of audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311845/#Comment_311845" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T07:58:35+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  7:58AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2011 9:30AM by Wordman.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've contributed to a bunch of kickstarters.

It's open source. There might be a book down the road, but the most up-to-date version will always live on the website. The art I want will go on a wiki. It will have a Creative Commons license. Anyone can download it for free. So, what do I offer to people who contribute to my project that I haven't already given away for free? I've only had a few ideas. For a fairly high bracket, you can choose what the art will depict. I've toyed with the idea of some kind of enhanced account on the website, but that just pushes off the problem, as I don't know yet what I could give my premium visitors that I haven't given to everyone. Maybe this just means that this doesn't make a very good Kickstarter project?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312368/#Comment_312368" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T07:25:59+00:00" title="February 13, 2011  7:25AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a lot of people, open source would be a draw. You could send people who donate printed version of the artwork signed by the artist. This could work really well if you pick an artist with a large fan base and online presence. Coordinate with the artist(s) to make sure they are on board before hand and will promote your project for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312371/#Comment_312371" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T08:44:08+00:00" title="February 13, 2011  8:44AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it matters, I increase my donation amount for open source projects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312372/#Comment_312372" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-13T09:22:38+00:00" title="February 13, 2011  9:22AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, I don't think you'll have a problem. My tack with Dungeon World and Powers For Good is to release the plain text of the whole thing, free and open. Then charge some for the layout and art version, in PDF and print (caveat: I haven't hit this point yet, so I can't say for sure it works, but early signs point to yes). You might consider making the full-art version something that only people who support the project get. This isn't exactly a new approach, it's essentially what WotC did with d20: they released the plaintext for free, allowing people to create their own presentations (like the hypertext d20 srd), but charge for PDF and print versions of their nice looking books.<br/><br/>Thanks for the information everyone. I'm planning on using Kickstarter as a preorder mechanism to offset the print runs for my games, and this information is great to have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
