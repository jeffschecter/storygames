Yesterday put on a miniatures game story game of "Last of the Mohicans". It used the action cards previously described in threads. That game went off well with all kinds of weird things happening (very true to James Fenemore Coopers turgid writing style - you can't be more unrealistic than he was.) That game went fast, two hours, so we had time to play a second game. I trotted out Fairy Tale Assassin League.<br/><br/>So, I laid out the locations (Restaurant with stage show) picked the Wicked Witch as my bad guy, because the host is always the bad guy. Good guys like red riding hood, and tinker bell were out there trying to stop my coerced porn ring (the with was very wicked). We tore through action cards with lots of challenges. An innovation I added was that all the  actions happened unless the winner of a challenge specifically says it didn't happen. That only happened twice. Backs were stabbed left and right and in then end most of us were gunned down in the witches hospital room. Because the game uses victory points we had winners and losers and I used the standings to give a kind of Fiasco outcome. The winners got to appear in the movies sequel with better roles (even if they died in the first game). <br/><br/>The game was a Gas and I got some video of player comments that I will put up soon. Everyone had a good time and  the game gave us another hour and half of play. I'm feeling very positive about the  sales potential of the game. Time to start raising kick starter funds. But first got to  do a campaign for Mongolian Goat Rodeo.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411496/#Comment_411496" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-07T07:11:05+00:00" title="April  7, 2013  7:11AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is a link to a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QAsUdF3cDc" rel="nofollow">video of player experiences.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
