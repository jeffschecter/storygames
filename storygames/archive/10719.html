Not enough people pitch in, no game-release.<br/><br/>Now, people say that with more money, they'd do more things: More art, more editing, better layout, more promotion, etc.<br/>So why not combine these two things for tiered ransom?<br/><br/>I, or someone else, writes a game. For let us say $200, I'd release the game. I leave the ransom up for two months. If I get the $200, I move to the next ransom: $100, and I'd have editing (please, I'm just throwing figures here), if I get the editing money after a month, the game will get edited, and I'd move to the next phase.<br/>Now, I'd potentially move to the next phase regardless of whether or not the previous one was met, and I'd let people know of the length of the cycle, so they won't think the game is released immediately upon the game being ransomed.<br/><br/>And that way I'd move on to art, layout, promotion.<br/><br/>The game would get released, so long the original ransom is met, but if you'd want the game you get, or gets released to be better looking, you'll need to chip in in additional places, or alternately, more people could chip in (we sometimes hear of people who heard too late, so didn't get to pre-order a copy this way, whatever).<br/><br/>This way people would know what their money is ear-marked for as well, you're basically generating free and ongoing word-of-mouth (though probably not all good!), and if the game has no art or editing, people will know why.<br/><br/>Now, I think this is the logical end of much of recent discussion, and I think it might actually work, but there is a certain amount of irony in my post. I don't think it's contradictory.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237992/#Comment_237992" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-17T16:25:46+00:00" title="October 17, 2009  4:25PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>I'd let people know of the length of the cycle, so they won't think the game is released immediately upon the game being ransomed.</blockquote>\nI think if I were taking part in this, I'd want the end of each ransom to bring with it something I could download as soon as possible. Why not, after the first $200, release a playtest Word document, after the next $100 a playtested edited Word document, after the next $200 release all the art even before you add the art to the document to make a final product. After all, we've paid for it: I think we should be allowed to see right away.<br/><br/>But I do think it's an excellent idea because it means people can keep contributing to the project even after the (original) ransom has ended. If the game is really well written, you'll also convince people who have already contributed to contribute again to the art, layout, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid" title="HiQKid"><img alt="HiQKid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid">HiQKid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238004/#Comment_238004" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-17T17:51:19+00:00" title="October 17, 2009  5:51PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James Desborough (Postmortem Studios) did something like this recently for the Neverwhere RPG, except with social networking instead of money.<br/>He said if he got X friend requests / follows, he'd release the game.

And that'd turn the "owning" that is shared of the art into something quite complicated, and does everyone who pays at any point gets access and "ownership" to everything done in the other "tiers" as well?<br/><br/>In other words, you gave an idea, but it's something vastly more complicated, and you should elaborate some on what you meant by it, or it's too wide and too narrow to mean anything?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238196/#Comment_238196" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T13:16:08+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  1:16PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 19, 2009 1:16PM by ChristopherWeeks.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I was thinking that a corporation would exist that owns the game as an intellectual property and all the buyers-in are shareholders in that company and have voting and dividend rights.  I'm not sure about vastly more complicated -- I mean, I'm sure there's a crap-load of stuff I don't know about forming and operating a corporation, but other than that, it seems like a pretty simple idea.<br/><br/>ETA: <br/>Playing on your example numbers above, a designer imagines a game and predicts that they'd need to get paid $200 to bring the system to a play-worthy state.  So an entity is formed to own the game.  Maybe the starting author holds the 200 shares.  Or maybe not, she's just an employee of the newly formed entity and once the entity has found some venture capital, it can start paying her for her design work.  Once the entity has the $200 (or maybe before that, if the shareholders decide to proceed and the designer is willing to start before the projected needs are met) design takes place.  The group then owns a game in rough state.  $100 more is found for editing, another $150 for interior illustrations, $200 for a cover and $100 for layout.  In stages or combined -- whatever.  At this point, a real, finished game is there, not yet printed or distributed.  But it's there and owned by the investors.  Maybe they gather enough cash to print it or maybe they donate it to the public domain and release it to the net as an HTML document.  That's up to the owners.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
