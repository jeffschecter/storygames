People talk about wanting to promote a certain tone or atmosphere or gathering tropes of a genre or dissecting the structure of certain kinds of stories.  But all of that isn\u2019t very useful because the actual game at hand is defined by its processes and procedures which is one of the biggest misunderstandings about The Big Model, it\u2019s about *process* and not about content.<br/><br/>At Nerdly Beach Party Paul Tevis and Ryan Maclin came up with this idea of Totemic Gaming.  The idea being that you knew you were playing a game because the game book was on the table, even though the ACTUAL procedures of play differed vastly from those presented in the game text.  The primary example was Totemic GURPS where players narrated stuff and \u201coccasionally rolled 3d6.\u201d  Paul goes so far to say in his pod cast, \u201cYou had people show up to these games who had never played GURPS\u2026 and still haven\u2019t.\u201d  I think actively recognizing this is VITAL for honest play and good design.  Identify the game you are ACTUALLY playing and don\u2019t just point to the Totem on the table.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s take a look at my personal preferences.<br/><br/>I really like Ron\u2019s adaptation of Ergri\u2019s dramatic narrative ideas to RPGs.  I like play which presents a Premise (a question about real world human behavior) and through play produces Theme (a localized answer to that question).  It\u2019s very important to me that the processes of play prevent any one person from controlling the Theme.  I like play processes which allow Theme to arise from ephemeral contributions of different players as processed via the system.  Consider the Humanity mechanic in Sorcerer.  You can be the biggest bastard but still get away with it or you might be a saint and still be damned, all on the turn of the dice.  You can\u2019t force any of the four big outcomes listed in Sorcerer\u2019s Soul.  They arise from play itself.<br/><br/>I really like Meg Baker\u2019s distinction between No One Gets Hurt vs. I Will Not Abandon You.  I used to very much be a No One Gets Hurt player and have to actively fight those social defense techniques.  Play is most rewarding for me when everyone at the table expresses a little vulnerability and we allow our fears and limits to be pushed and tested.  A successful game is one in which I learn something about myself or my fellow players as real people.  I think it says a lot about me that after playing so much Dirty Secrets and Spione that I now consider Sorcerer, My Life with Master and Dogs in the Vineyard to be my \u201clight\u201d games.<br/><br/>As a technique I really enjoy players (including the GM) as character advocates (however those characters are distributed).  This is because I think it\u2019s one of the most sure fire ways to achieve the above two preferences.  You can invest a character with those personal fears, limits and vulnerabilities and then pitting them against each other as mitigated by system prevents anyone person from dominating Theme.  This is really my personal definition of \u201cimmersion,\u201d genuinely feeling for my characters and playing to those feelings.<br/><br/>All combined I even have a term for my personal play preferences.  I call it, \u201cPlaying Passionately\u201d because it\u2019s all about forgetting \u201cthe\u201d story as an uber-structure and investing in the here and now fiction on a personal and emotional level and then taking action on those feelings.  Forget how things \u201cshould\u201d go.  Forget even where you \u201cwant\u201d things to go.  Invest, act and re-evaluate based on outcome.<br/><br/>Now here\u2019s the thing, since I think this is a fun and enjoyable thing I often speak as an advocate for this process.  If all you give me in a discussion is content: tone, atmosphere, genre tropes, plot devices, etc then the answer I give you is going to be rooted in the above because the above can be applied to any kind of content and I like to encourage people to try it out.<br/><br/>However, if people thought more critically about the actual processes and purpose of play like Paul and Ryan identifying Totemic Gaming then we could be more helpful with one another and designers could be more mindful of their designs (as I also advocate that design should be a selfish act and indeed you\u2019ll see that the most successful designers are selfish).  Articulate how and why you play, and design (if you design) to do that more efficiently.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152481/#Comment_152481" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T14:49:41+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  2:49PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "As a technique I really enjoy players (including the GM) as character advocates"<br/><br/>Wow, this is really cool.

Pure talk about purpose is best. The problem is, most of us have experienced what we want during certain content or process. The only language we typically have to talk about purpose is in the gutter speak of content and process. In other words, we can only talk about ends by talking about means. It's funny that way. You mention the selfish process - that's really quite handy, since at a certain point the person just stops talking and makes what they selfishly want. The game they then produce can help expland the language we have for describing purpose.<br/><br/>On a side note about totemic - that's really interesting. It was what I was getting at in the rule zero thread, when describing what a literal use of the rule means. It shows that rule zero typically only gets totemic use.

I really don't want to play a game to feel bad. And I don't like feeling vulnerable at all.<br/>\nI don't think many people do, actually. People feel better about others when they can see the vulnerability in them, but it sucks to suffer that yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't mind so much, I suppose, if I had some tool that would allow me to detach myself from the discomfort or make the discomfort itself some sort of tool, so I knew, before one particular patch or other of this vulnerability started that I was pretty much guaranteed a good outcome or a dose of power for it. But that's catharsis and outside what this thread was supposed to be about.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if I attempt to refute the process and purpose of play as being generally unaccomidating toward uncomfortable situations, I need to come up with something less anecdotal. Consider that satisfying play of any kind normally consists of mock actions in a safe environment.

I have lots of experience playing with vulnerability, both my own and others, and having great fun doing so. To design games that makes it <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fun</span></b> to have some part of your self at stake, is fully possible. Most people actually find such involvement to be challenging and exciting, and are able to see the fun in it when play commence. Some people feel a bit threatened, but even most of them will accept it and act accordingly. That's my experience.<br/><br/>The trick is to <i><b>invite </b></i>people into using their vulnerability, usually by showing your own vulnerabilities (the dynamics of social response is a great tool).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152790/#Comment_152790" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T18:54:03+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  6:54PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, to lay out my play preferences: <br/>I would like to follow the rules, because I want to beat those rules. To divert from the rules means I wont be beating them, I'll be beating something else. Those rules are my target and I want to keep shooting them until they are crushed. This means I want to actually finish an RPG game - I know this is anathema on pretty much every RPG forum I've ever been on, so really I don't belong. Here I am. By finish I aim toward some end condition - top level has always struck me as an end condition in D&amp;D for example. This is also usually why I have trouble reading new indie RPG's, because while they present a million options, I don't see any ending that I'd use those options to get towards. That's usually because the designer just intended exploration of options for explorations sake, rather than in getting toward an ending.<br/><br/>Once I have completed a game, it's a trophy to me. Sure, people might challenge me to games of it latter, and my skill at it might become rusty over time. But at some point in my personal history I beat the game. And to a degree I expect that other roleplayers recognise this accomplishement. In that respect I am somewhat deluded - most don't give a crap about any of that, even though they would invite me into their game. Typically they are not aware anyone could have expectations different from their own - for the longest time I was that way myself.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems though, is that beating a game means mastering all circumstances within it. But most RPG's have massive currency leaks, where the GM can call on unlimited elephants or unlimited gold to land on you. Many would and have said (including Ron Edwards) 'Oh, that'd be rubbish play. A GM shouldn't resort to that' or such like. This is scrub ruling ( <a href="http://www.sirlin.net/Features/feature_PlayToWinPart1.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sirlin.net/Features/feature_PlayToWinPart1.htm</a> ). Unlimited resources is another circumstance to master. The irony is, the way of mastering it is pretty much identical to scrub ruling. The only means possible to really control it is social manipulation "Oh, that's a cheap move, GM! You shouldn't do that!" and suchlike. And presumably, since there is no other means of overcoming unlimited resources, this method is within the boundaries of the challenge (though this is merely an assumption). You might like to think of it as hacking your GM, like one might hack a computer. Though on the other hand, this situation has given me piercing insight into the ways social politics work.<br/><br/>The problem I have with writing up my own game(s) is that I have not finished this game of hacking. I dislike currency leaks - they lead to all sorts of murk. Murk which I could master, as any circumstance. And given the rabidness of most roleplayers to push their murk, it seems like they are acting the opponent. But my estimate is, and this is just an estimate, that if I fully mastered this, the other person would acknowledge my victory not because they see it, but because they have, to a degree, become a puppet extension of me. Which would mean no one would hail my victory. Your probably thinking 'That's wacked out to think you could do that!'. As I said, it's an estimate of what it would take, rather than what might actually be possible. This is what concerns me about currency leaks, is that this is the only way to master them. And yet I don't know if that's true, it's just an estimate. So I'm still in love with this battle and all it's subtle intricacies. I don't know if it could only end in an abhorent way. So I have no solid moral reason to throw it all away (and the years of my life dedicated to it), and the currency leak games are so damn engaging it distracts me from writing games which have no currency leaks/have less complicated circumstances to master. Why make something less when there's such a wonderfully complex game already there?<br/><br/>Well, that's helped me typing it out, but I imagine it's perhaps quite shocking in some ways. But if asked, this is me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152792/#Comment_152792" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T19:01:37+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  7:01PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>At Nerdly Beach Party Paul Tevis and Ryan Maclin came up with this idea of Totemic Gaming.</blockquote>\nTo avoid being given undue credit for things, I should make clear that I borrowed the idea from Ben Lehman, who introduced me to it about three years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152793/#Comment_152793" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-24T19:03:13+00:00" title="June 24, 2008  7:03PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>One of the things that bothers me about RPG discussions is that they usually focus on content rather than process and purpose.

"Shocking" things is where we discover new ground to be forged in design and play.<br/><br/>It seems to me that End Conditions is not enough for you.  There must be a sense of Achievement associated with that End Condition.  For example, one of the reason I like the indie games is because they have End Conditions.<br/><br/>Sorcerer - Ends when the situation proposed by the character's Kicker is resolved.<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard - Ends the players declare the problems of the town solved.<br/>My Life with Master - Ends when the Master is killed.<br/>Primetime Adventures - Episode ends when the Producer runs out of Budget.  Season ends after 5 or 9 Episodes.<br/>Inspectres - Ends when the PCs have accumulated enough Franchise dice.<br/>Spione - Ends when all the Principles Supporting Cast have permanently exited the story.<br/>Dirty Secrets - Ends when all the Crimes have been Resolved.<br/>It Was A Mutual Decision - Progresses through three phases of play each with their own mechanical end condition.<br/>One Can Have Her - Ends when the players run out of cards.<br/><br/>But!  There is no sense of Achievement associated with any of those (MAYBE My Life with Master).  The end conditions are not something you STRIVE for via rules manipulation, which seems to be what you're talking about.

Preferrably, since this is a game and therefore an example of human play, those rules should be easy to learn and require very little effort. That includes emotional effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to explore the reason why aspects of myself do things, but not to the point of discomfort (and, yes, it's nice if one can be guided through that discomfort, but there's a lot of myself I like to keep hidden for reasons of both profit and companionship. )<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy making things up off-the-cuff and I like to see other players do it as well, but I don't much care if it's good or profound, although it helps if the input doesn't jar me out of whatever pleasant daydream the game was setting up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also prefer it if the GM or Referee has very minimal control, if any. Almost as if the GM was only there at the beck and call of the players, not responsible for the whole shebang. I'm going to have to use a specific example, here: I think it's more fun if the GM exists only to react, unable to make a ruling or a solid contribution without being summoned or invoked by one or more of the other players. It's probably even better if there isn't a GM per se, or if the GM is like the Banker in Monopoly, someone who has taken a minor extra responsibility instead of a major one. (I hope this isn't off the topic, it's just one of my major agendas.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like the option to pass on a turn or fade into the background if I'm out of ideas or just feel a little too pressured.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I think about it, the more I'm glad you came up with the passionate play example. I think it's a wonderful pursuit, but I need to come up with another style description. Perhaps "Beer and Pretzels" can be merged with "Casual-Gamer-ific" in some manner? Defense-Mechanism-Friendly Gaming, perhaps? Passive Aggressive Play?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, anyway, I do like your Passionate Play example and I hope to see more examples of it, soon. I hope this gives you a poolside or a counterpoint to push off of and explore your favorite style.

At least I think that's the question being asked here.<br/><br/>When I push on the game fiction (ie assert what I want to happen) I want the fiction to push back.  I don't want what I say to just happen.  I should have to work some for it, maybe even work a lot.  When I propose something interesting I don't want the GM or the game rules or whatever authority there is to just say, "Awesome!  That happens."  The second that happens the thing I proposed becomes completely uninteresting.  Don't get me wrong.  I don't want to be constantly blocked from making fictional contributions.  I just want there to be procedures in place for me to make those contributions where I have to contend against appropriate opposition for it to happen.<br/><br/>My personal preference are procedures that are simple in concept but complex in execution.  Like chess.  Rules need to make it so that there is never an optimal way to attack and issue.  Every attack (application of the rules to a situation) should have an appropriate response that counters it and makes it no longer optimal.  Once again like chess.  In chess there is no single optimal strategy that will give you the advantage every time.  There's always a counter if your opponent can intuit what your plans are.<br/><br/>If I can't have simple concept and complex execution, I want a systems that has lots of interconnected parts and complex interactions within it.  Games that give me processes to play with and manipulate in order to get what I want.  If every interaction with the system happens the same way over and over and over, then I'm bored.  <br/><br/>All of that stuff up there doesn't mean I can't enjoy playing lots of different games and styles.  It's just my preference, especially for long sustained play.  I've played and enjoyed PTA but I don't know that I could sustain an interest in the game for more than 3-5 sessions in a time.  The system just seems a little to simplistic to hold my attention.  It's still a great game to pull out and insert between other games for something a little different.  I like Burning Wheel.  Lots of parts to manipulate and some decent strategy elements.  Also, it constantly feels like the fiction is pushing against me when playing BW.  I have to work for just about everything.<br/><br/>Well, that seemed very rambling.  Hope it was at least semi-coherent.<br/><br/>Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152887/#Comment_152887" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T07:54:54+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  7:54AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I play I want create, I want to make choices for my character like I would if I were brainstorming ideas for a novel or short story.  I want to make choices for my character that both make sense in the fiction and impress the audience with being particularly perfect for the moment, or fantastically unexpected.  I want the other players to be similarly surprising me with amazing things they come up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nClinton once referred to Universalis as a game full of suspence because you never knew what curves the other players were going to throw into the mix.  Yes.  That was just about my favorite Uni comment ever, I want that in every game.<br/>\n<br/>\nPut both of these together and I have a decided leaning towards games where players are acting independently of each other (i.e. non party play) they may ally, they may be rivals, one player's PC might wind up being the true villain of the story.  When you play as a party its easy for the party to become the character and less easy for players to be coming up with amazing curveballs.  When you play as individual characters each with their own agenda, its harder for a player to keep playing without contributing.  If they don't contribute creatively they wind up more audience and less player...they have to step up and do something because their character is pretty much on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like games with rules.  Freeform and fiat can work for me under certain very narrow circumstances but generally aren't reliable for me.  The rules set the parameters for how to deal with what the other players are doing.  They should be designed to be as evocative and purposeful as possible.  The trade off between the two different kinds of resolution in Grey Ranks...perfect for Grey Ranks...probably lame for most anything else.  The completely arbitrary choice between two equally cool options in PTA...perfect for PTA (because you can envision invisible script writers for the TV show coming up with two alternatives and arguing about which one to go with...the random cards tell you who won the arguement) pretty boring (for me) for most anythig else.  The accordion rules in Spione, perfect for demonstrating what The Cold means mechanically.  Really sucky for just about anything else.  I like rules that teach me how the game wants me to think and approach conflict in the game.  In Grey Ranks it highlights personal sacrifice for the good of the group (or not).  In Spione it highlights that whatever you try to do...fate will decide and you're just a leaf blowing in the wind...damn.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like games where there's never a question of who has the authority to say what, when, and have it stick.  What is the process of play.  Roll this die against this target number...yadda yadda.  When do I roll it?  Why do I roll it?  When would be a good time to not roll it?  What do I do if I don't like the direction things are going in, what recourse do I have?  I love rules like "Say yes or roll the dice"...not so much for that particular rule...but for having such a rule to begin with.  The player has said something, what are the GM's options on how to respone...oh, there they are...follow the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like games that play with minimal prep.  It doesn't have to be entirely show up and start, but I'm not putting together a binder full of campaign notes any more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like games where tragedy is an acceptable possible outcome.  Where sometimes that means the character has a completely sad ending that all the players just know feels right (like the last Grey Ranks game I played), and sometimes that means where the tragedy is the player having failed to earn the outcome for their character they envisioned.  If everyone at the table gets the exact thing they want for their characters...then there's nothing to struggle over, the game becomes more an exercise is novel writing with some random rolls providing constraints.  When players can feel like they lost (where "lost" means failed to be an effective advocate for their character)...that they as a player "let their character down"...then you see passion, creative curveballs, clever ideas, and players willing to betray other player's characters to ensure the end they want for their character.  I like that.  IMO the best play happens when players are willing to fight with each other for their character's happy ending (keeping in mind that some character's idea of a happy ending might itself look pretty tragic).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ultimately that means I need to play with creatively assertive players.  I struggle in games with wall flower players who aren't claiming their share of the spot light.  I struggle in games with players who passively let me get away with claiming too much, cuz if allowed I'll wind up claiming it all...playing my character and your characters too just to get stuff to happen, and that's not really all that fun for me either.  I need to play with players who find creative wrestling fun and don't shy away from being encroached on, or encroaching others.  I don't have much patience with players who view their characters and their vision as being sacred and protected, I need them to be willing to go to the mat defending their vision and thus being willing to lose it, because its the creative wrangling that's fun for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152892/#Comment_152892" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T08:18:16+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  8:18AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            May I request we start a new thread for what we all like specifically in a game design and why?

Or in the context of a specific rules-set: "How do I make challenges in Game X more, well, challenging?"<br><br>I could bicker on this point all day, but now that you've clarified what you want, I'll cede that, yes, we don't often discuss the thing you want here.  So, for here, I'll give it a bit of a go:<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>What I want out of play varies by game and mood, immensely.  When I read through "how to do stuff" in a game book, I try to mentally construct "how could this be fun, or stasfying, or otherwise good times?" in my head, and get an image of play.  If I succeed at getting an image of play that looks like good times, the game has my interest and goes on the "I should play that" stack.  Especially if the good stuff looks like something that will teach me skills I can apply elsewhere.<br/><br/>Good times that give me tools to make other times better?   That's dead sexy.<br/><br/>In general, overall, I favor play that is kinetic (throw dice, flip tokens, screw with minis), tactical (but not necessarily strategic; I want to think on my feet more than I want to "get the perfect build"), and 'loose', systematically - I want the group to be ready to look at the written rules, flip 'em the bird, and improv better ones for the moment, should it be needed.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153027/#Comment_153027" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T18:18:55+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  6:18PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trying to put it into words.  <br/><br/>The main reason I like rules is creative limitation. I work best when there's some sort of limit. I've tried free form, and it's just too free.<br/><br/>Actually, that's about it.  Other parts are facets of that. I like outcomes that can do more than pass/fail, but rather provide for this/that results (or this/that/other/other-other/ad infinitum). I like to be able to make a declaration and not have it guaranteed.<br/><br/>I also like systems that allow for flexibility, but keep a certain throughline - call it balance, call it premise, call it genre, call it engaging story, what that throughline can be called varies from system to system.  But it keeps us playing in a river instead of sending us out to see, and keeping us out of the quagmires.<br/><br/>Creative limitation is the key for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153035/#Comment_153035" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T19:08:45+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  7:08PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should point out that I've met plenty of players who crave Jesse's style of play. I've received criticism for being too aware of comfort zones and not creating enough of an emotional challenge or helping players really feel their way around their characters. These are valid criticisms, I feel, but not ones I'm interested in solving. I just don't feel strong enough and I'm doubtful of the benefits to my own personality.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also like to stress that I enjoy playing out fake emotions better than real ones, as JD points out. I like to have that shield available for myself (I don't really trust or like my true emotions.

And it was really a lot group-specific, in the sense that I was always trying to compensate for some problem in the group. So, for example, at first, when I began to play in a group with a killer-GM, I played always in a very tactical way to make my character survive, trying at the same time to assert in the game that he was an individual, and not a pawn. When I created another group with the people dissatisfied with the first, for years I GM'd 90% of the time and often in that role my purpose was simply to juggle between all the different interest of a very diverse group.  In the last years before discovering The Forge,  when I was a player I was always bothered by the widespread illusionism that dominated everywhere, both with the other two co-GMs and almost every time I went to a convention. Everyone had "his story" that has to go in a certain way, no matter what we did. If we failed a chapter, there were always lots of NPCs to save us and keep us in the right track. I was so enraged by this widespread railroading (that really had become "the right way to play" for an entire subculture that dominated the hobby, at least in Italy) that I played always with two very precise objective: avoid that railroading (this often meant trying not only to win an encounter, but even to win it very fast, before the GM had time to "save the day" with his NPC. Sometimes it didn't work because the GM "saved us" with his NPCs even after we had already won, and continued playing as he didn't even notice that we could have won anyway because his "story" counted on us having a debt with someone...), and placing my character firmly as a protagonist, taking every scrap of characterization I could grab that wasn't fixed in the GM story (to give an example: a GM was so clearly in love of the clich\xe9 "the heroes arrive at the end tired, wounded and wearing only dirty tatters", that I took as my personal objective to arrive at the end of the dungeon clean and without a wrinkle in my mage's dress. And I did it, with action as, for example, staying exactly one yard outside the area of effect (calculated to the square foot) of a fireball, standing still, to avoid hand-fighting the GM's dirty monsters engulfed in the fire (you have to imagine the GM frantically using a pocket calculator to check if I had really foiled him another time, or if I had missed something in my quick mental calculations).<br/><br/>I could arrive at this amount of "protagonism", often against the GMs' wishes, because I did know the rules better than anybody, I was able to calculate very fast all the tiny adjustment for any variable I could add, and I did play with the social standing of the GMs applying the minimal amount of rules-lawyering needed to get what I wanted and no more.  The necessity of this kind of social manipulations, associated with the omnipresent drifting caused by the unfocused rule systems and the widespread abuse of rule zero had the usual consequences described by the forge theory (that at the time I didn't know): my gaming group becoming more and more insular, and my being considered "the best player" (the others always followed my lead, seeing that the alternative was to be "saved" by the insupportable NPCs the GM sent every time...) and "the best GM" (because I wasn't so pushing and overbearing in my railroading. I was a master illusionist, and I did know my players enough to know how to make them react the way I wanted even without using force). Add to this that I was considered a very good player even outside my insular group (I still have the prizes I won as Best player in some tournaments...), and I was very active in internet discussion (in Italian) about rpgs, discussion that I tended to "win" by ridiculing the opposite argument, and all in all what happened, without me being aware of the fact, was that, little by little, my purpose in rpgs became proving myself "better" than everybody else: players, GMs, people in discussion forums, etc.<br/><br/>This, associated with an increasing lowering of my expectations about rpgs. That I saw more and more as limited by a lot of habits, and weakness, and problems, something that could not, ever, be used for the kind of story I dreamed when I began playing it, so many years ago. But if rpgs are worth less that I thought, then even being one of the best in playing them is worth less...<br/><br/>(continue)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153200/#Comment_153200" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T13:52:10+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  1:52PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/><br/>So, for a while, I became very disinterested in rpgs, seeing all the time I used to learn and to play and talk about them as fundamentally wasted. Without the motivation to endure some people to "be able to play", I simply left the old group (one of the best decision I ever made about rpgs, even if it's little my fault if they had become like that), and began to play with other people "just to pass the time", without a lot of ambitions about it. It was at this time that I had some play experience that made me rethink and contextualize the articles I had read at the Forge before (that I could not understand at the time), and allowed me to delve more profoundly in forge theory.  And this lead to (1) a much better understanding of the mechanisms that  caused trouble in my previous 15-years-long history with rpgs, and the solution of many of them , and (2) a much better understanding of the possibilities of rpgs, not limited as I thought before, and, (3) the realization that I, really, did know very little about rpgs. Yes, I did know more about them than almost every person I did personally know, but they really did know very little about them, too. Nothing that really mattered anyway.<br/><br/>From that moment (a little more than two years ago) I have a very precise objective in my role-playing: I want to learn.  I want to learn different practices, different ways of playing, different systems (REALLY different, not only in the kind of dice used). My "old ways" failed me, bored me, and don't interest me anymore, I want to learn different ways. And, even after having learned them, I want to learn other ways, too. <br/><br/>This learning isn't separated from the objective of "having fun". First, learning for me IS fun. Always was. Second, it's like a market investment. Trying a new way today can be a little less fun that using something that I already know and enjoy (as Dogs in the Vineyard, for example), but I wager that, at the end, I will have much more fun tomorrow if I take a little time today learning something more.<br/><br/>This is not always easy for the people who play with me. Most of them play to have fun, right now, with the least amount of work. When something don't work right the first time, their reaction usually is "bah, scrap this, let's play what we know it works". My reaction usually is "no, let's try again, and again, until it works for us". My fun "right now" is expendable against the chance to learn something new that could increase my enjoyment of rpgs again. Even in my new (much better) new regular group very few players share this interest, so I organize playtests or try-out with these few players or with other groups to be able to play the more "difficult" games.<br/><br/>And, after so many years, rpgs are interesting again!  :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153271/#Comment_153271" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T19:39:40+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  7:39PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>But! There is no sense of Achievement associated with any of those (MAYBE My Life with Master). The end conditions are not something you STRIVE for via rules manipulation, which seems to be what you're talking about. As such, have you looked at:<br/><br/>Agon?<br/>Rune?<br/>Ron's proto-gamist game Black Fire?<br/>Spycraft's Mastermind creation rules?</blockquote>\nI googled Agon's sample rules. I like the clean, crisp layout. But from skimming it, I can't identify from where adversity comes from. Yeah, I saw the GM has some currency, but it's not been beyond RPG's to have GM currency, then resort to GM fiat/currency leaks anyway (making them the same as D&amp;D, basically, which I've already bought). However, since I didn't run into anything, perhaps it is neat. I'll keep an eye out for it in shops, though most likely I'd have to order it since I'm in Australia.<br/><br/>Rune, I looked at some quick start rules an age ago. Heavy, heavy handling time there. Same with Black fire. It seems...I dunno, I'd have to like faffing around with rules learning and applyin and setting up setting alot (in black fire), to read through to the adversity, let alone run it and <i>actually </i>get to the adversity. Even fighting fantasy books don't take pages and pages before your at risk of losing. Both these games seem to indulge in remembering causality like rules and setting invention first - I don't think they are actually gamist designs. I think their sim spiced with the tension of nuetered gamism. Neutered because all the rules learning and setting making - well, your not about to throw away all that effort by beating it in the first five minutes, even if that IS the optimal move to make. That's describing it briefly - a whole thread could be devoted to that subject, if not several. Also, Agon struck me in this way a bit as well (but atleast it was layed out in a more comfortable manner). Also, I've found the D&amp;D 4e to be like this too - pushing the importance of minutae book keeping ahead of actually doing anything like stepping on up right this instant. I did look for keep on the shadowfell, which I suspect meets a more immediate step on up, but can't find it in Australia.<br/><br/>Haven't seen the mastermind rules at all.

"I am interested in learning more about rpgs" mean "I am interested only in rpgs" only as much as saying "I like Ice Cream" mean "I will not eat anything not made by ice cream anymore"  ;-)<br/><br/>This association is even stranger, thinking that this thread is about the purpose of PLAY. The purpose of the time when we meet with other people and play with them. I think it would be a little strange if I show up at the table with a big book about Global Warming and said to the other players "I thought of using the time of our weekly game to study this while you play"...  :-)\n<blockquote>Are you sure your done with the old ways, or is there a lingering desire about them that made you choose to learn, not about some other subject, but still focus on RPGs?</blockquote>\nI am not "done with the old ways" because they still resurface, sometimes, when I am tired or distracted, and old habits come up to ruin the game.  It's incredible how all I have learned in so many years of "traditional gaming" was really disruptive, acted counter of my own goals, or was useless or really, really stupid.<br/>The time I wasted act, yes, as a kind of "pressure" to avoid wasting any more time in playing not-fun games.

Not only to I want the game to surprise me, but I want to surprise myself and my friends with what I'm capable of creating and responding to.<br/><br/>Another way is like model trains.  Y'know, setting up all those little pieces and watching with pride and wonderment as it moves basically on it's own.  Now add onto that the ability for players and the system to move those pieces and introduce new ones on-the-fly, and then we get to see what consequences it had.  This one also revolves around surprise; we often end up in places that no one could have anticipated.  Sometimes everyone puts the train set together and fucks with it as a group, sometimes the GM (usually me) puts the train set together and lets the players fuck with it, then the GM fucks with the parts that the players interjected.  Sometimes there's a story, and sometimes there's not, and sometimes there's a story on accident, but that's not important; what matters in this mode is fiddling with all the pieces then seeing what happens.  (Train wrecks are fun, by the way, but most fun when you didn't expect them.)<br/><br/>A third way is a little something I like to call the Way of the Disco Samurai.  I use the word "disco" here because, to me, it connotes a certain flamboyance and radically ramped-up machismo or machisma (depending on your sex or preferred gender role).  I use the word "samurai" because this is about battle, the contest, and because it's about battle taken to the point of something artistic and transcendent.  In some ways, this is like Playing to Win, because everyone plays to the top of their ability--to do less would be a dishonesty and a dishonor to your opponent and the universe at large!  But, in other ways, it's not, because you refrain from certain tactics, because you have certain expectations of yourself and each other, and because the arena is clearly defined and focused.  The most important expectation here is the artfulness of your maneuvers.  <i>It's gotta look good</i>.  If you defeat me by dropping unlimited elephants on me, then bullshit.  You have won nothing.  There is no art in that.  If you defeat me in a way that is clever and beautiful and legitimately <i>more skilled</i> than I was, then I will say with my last breath as I spew pressurized blood, "At last, I get to see the Shoruya Horse-Killing Technique," and die with a smile on my face, just like in the samurai movies.  To battle is to ask yourself who you are.  To attack is to express yourself through your blade.  To win is to prove your power to your opponent, to yourself, and to the universe at large.  To lose is to have the opportunity to learn something.  I want to battle you, to attack you with everything I have, and I want you to do the same.  And, you know what?  I hope I lose, because then I have the opportunity to learn.<br/><br/>Edit:  I want to add that I use competition in all of these modes as an engine to drive things into action.  But only in the Way of the Disco Samurai is there real loss (i.e., something at stake), although in all three modes a loss is also a gain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153473/#Comment_153473" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T21:15:50+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  9:15PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno, I think you gave a line by line responce, which sort of snapped the context of my post in half <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/><br/>Hi Daniel,<br/><br/>I just don't buy into that disco samurai idea. As I see it it's never <i>really </i>admitting defeat. It's always seeing some upside, some win - that you got to see the horse killing technique. I'm inclined to think of the samurai character in the movie you mention as having lost because he keeps seeing upsides when it's really a dead end. Some paths go nowhere, they are dead ends. But to see some upside to them is to keep traveling them - onward, to oblivion. The reason he's <i>experiencing </i>the horse killing technique is because he kept walking past one dead end too many.<br/><br/>Dead ends are ugly. That's <i>why </i>you try to avoid them. The idea that it's bullshit if it's ugly (like the million elephants), stops anything from being a dead end. It either dismisses it as bullshit, or pretties it up and makes it good, which is just changing the game until the dead end becomes a viable path. Or do you have a rough limit on how many dead ends you'll see an upside too, before conceding? I could see that as viable, because there's still one dead end - you don't go beyond that limit.<br/><br/>I don't buy it, overall. But my post can be read as a reflection of my own playstyle, and the questions at the end are genuine and I think on topic to the thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153845/#Comment_153845" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T10:45:26+00:00" title="June 30, 2008 10:45AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan,<br/><br/>(Please call me Marshall; it's my middle name, but it's the one I use.

The RULES are the unwritten rules of social interaction that ultimately decide whether you actually won, or just think you did.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I deliver the ultimate beat down in a game that I love to play, but in the process my play group was miserable and never wants to play the game again...then ultimately...I just lost, I lost the ability to play that game again with these people.

To me its not, not if I have any respect for the opinions of my friends.  On the other hand, if the score says "I lose" and the rules say "yup, someone else won" but my friends say "wow, that was just about the most awesome play we've ever seen, can we play this game again...then I win...win for real, not the pretend kind of win that comes from the score of a game.  The real kind of win that comes from earning the respect and admiration of others.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming I didn't do damage to your definition of Disco Samurai play Marshall...yeah, I play that way...ALOT...Blood Red Sands is the game of Disco Samurai play.

When you lose, you control your unhappy 'your a lamo' responce, seeing the truth of their win and actually smiling, taking it graciously and congratulating them on the win. It's emotional discipline. If you want to frame it in terms of winning even when you lose, graciously accepting a loss is a way of showing your quality to others. Their admiration of your grace is a win even in the face of loss. Typically other people admire it because they have all lost at some point and understand what it's like to suck it up. In other words, they sympathise and that's a basis for comraderie even between opponents.<br/><br/>Just seeking gratification purely from the game and arranging results so the game trundles on and on, would be to miss out on this payoff.<br/><br/>BUT, I will say that in alot of current RPG's, it isn't a system result - it can usually be traced to someone just deciding you've lost. In terms of the above, this sort of design typically poisons the well from the begining. Even if someone was interested, the poison of just accepting someone deciding they have lost, has them heading straight in the opposite direction.

That all such accusations are just examples of people being poor sports about being defeated?  That hasn't been my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact here's some actual play from my distant Junior High School past which taught me a tough lesson about what sportsmanship REALLY means.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're playing Battlesystem, the old AD&amp;D; minis mass combat rules.  I'm playing a mixed force of "good guys" struggling to hold off the vanguard of an advancing humanoid army played by my best friend.  My friend had a unit of Trolls as being his heavy hitters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Battlesystem each figure represented multiple trolls and a figure could be either destroyed or damaged...being damaged again meant you were destroyed.  Attacks factored in how much damage a unit could do and if it was enough to outright destroy an enemy figure, flip it to damaged, or bounce entirely.  I had a small unit of elven archers...they could not do enough damage to destroy a figure of Trolls, but they could damange one.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's where I achieved the hieght of my career as a rules lawyering bastard.  See in Battlesystem, the Trolls regeneration power meant that a damaged Troll figure could be flipped back to undamaged if it didn't move.  In a different section of the rules, units were prohibited from breaking up into smaller units.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I shot a troll and damaged it, the entire unit of 20 Troll figures could not move.  It was stuck...because that one figure could not regenerate if it moved and if it didn't move, no one else could either because they weren't allowed to split the unit to leave it behind.  So my little unit of elven archers kept the entire Troll battle force from moving...or else they'd have to give up regenerating.  It clearly made no sense, it clearly was the result of unintentional rules interaction that probably wound up being corrected with a later errata (which preinternet we had no access to), it was clearly not fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI insisted, I demanded that the rules be followed to the letter.  I won the scenario.  I nearly lost my best friend...not because he was being a poor loser, but because I was being a dick.  Huge, major league, rules lawyering asshole who put my desire to "win" above the desire to have fun doing it, above the desire to treat my friend the way I'd want to be treated.  What I did was totally legal, by the rules...it was also total lamo cheese monkey bullshit and while I may have "won" the scenario I became an inferior person to do it...which is a loss condition in my book...not to mention we never continued our massive war campaign which we'd both been looking forward to for months...I lost by winning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's when I first realized that sportsmanship doesn't mean playing by the rules and not cheating.  Playing by the rules and not cheating means playing by the rules and not cheating.  Sportsmanship means going beyond mere letter of the law and into the realm of "do unto others..."<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much better would my victory have been if I hadn't resorted to such a cheesy tactic?  How much better would the campaign have been and our mutual enjoyment of it, if I'd lost the scenario but everyone had a blast doing it?  To me, the heart of Disco Samurai play (or Heavy Metal Samurai play...I like that better) is in recognizing that doing anything to win, means you lose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154427/#Comment_154427" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T10:34:59+00:00" title="July  2, 2008 10:34AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Disco Samurai, Heavy Metal Samurai, OI!

Sometimes he went too far and his opponents could get a referee to admonish him, but doing so would damage his opponent's concentration more than enduring it in silence.<br><br>I am sure that, in his mind, he was only "doing everything he could to win that was tolerated", and he was not cheating. But I didn't ever play with him. No one did. He went to the club only for a couple of tournaments, stayed for a while, and when nobody at the end played with him he did left. It was made really clear to him that it was really better if he didn't show up at the next tournament, too.<br><br>From what I remember, he did live in another town, and traveled to find someone who played with him.

Two hours or so? Also there'd be the handling time I guess of moving minis, looking up rules. But also I imagine conceding defeat was allowable - which could shorten all of that.<br/><br/>So basically he was going to cease being friends with you over a couple of wasted hours? Less time if he just conceded?<br/><br/>Your idea of 'sportsmanship' is based on avoiding someone doing that?<br/><br/>Now, you said it was juniour high. I was petty in high school, lots of people were. Do I have some room to suggest that when we were all in high school, we were a bit less mature? Do I have room to state your friend, back in high school, was being petty?<br/><br/>A friendship ditched for two hours wasted? FFS! To meet up with friends now I often have to travel public transport an hour one way, then an hour back, usually with some nutzoid on the PT who makes me feel literally unsafe. Not to mention all the other hours I've wasted doing little just for friendship. But them losing two hours just shuffling mini's around would make you less of a person? Don't you think this is a bit disproportionate?<br/><br/>I mean, what does it take these days, as an adult for you to ditch someone? I bet you've have friends who have drink drived, or used hand held mobiles while driving. Stuff that makes them more likely to kill people - kill! Not make them suffer two hours of moving mini's about and looking up tables. But you've tolerated that. What else have you tolerated, which has more of an effect than losing time? You've never had anyone arrive to a diner date late? Was that the end of the relationship, that you sat and twisted a napkin for 45 minutes?<br/><br/>You've had an experience in your formative years which has coloured your perception of playing to win. Even though that experience was really quite disproportionate. Yeah, in highschool kids ditched friendships over a couple of hours lost (or less, even). I've watched my own child in primary school playing (I suppose that's elementary school, in America) and the games they set up are nothing more than a pretext for setting up a pecking order. I doubt it'll get much better into highschool.<br/><br/>Frankly it sounds like your friend expected it to be a social lubricant and nothing more - as much a game as having drinks together or watching a movie together is a game. In other words, not a game at all. It wasn't you being unsportsmanlike, it was just plain old clashing agendas. You can't 'sportsmanship' a clashing agenda into shape.<br/><br/>Me? I like your tactic - nasty! If I thought the game would drag on with me predictably losing, I'd concede and congratulate your strength of skill (then I'd start plotting how to beat you next time, but that's part of the cycle!). But note, back in high school, I don't think I'd be nearly so mature about it - I'd like to think I would, but even in my mid twenties I've slammed my fists on the table from losing half my hard won gold in a board game, in just one unavoidable roll. Yes, I wasn't having fun - but that's my problem, not yours. It's not up to you to make up for my weakness or anybody elses. It's up to me or them to have the emotional discipline to suck it up, or realise we don't have the emotional strength for the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154779/#Comment_154779" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T23:12:05+00:00" title="July  3, 2008 11:12PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan,<br/>Maybe look at it this way:  the central thing with Disco/Metal/Opera/whatever Samurai play is a certain restriction on the win condition--or, to use your words, a certain defined border of the challenge.  In Disco Samurai play, it's not a win unless the move impressed us on an aesthetic level, no matter what other objectives were achieved.  If you use maneuvers that are lame-o cheesemonkey in our book, you went outside the defined borders of the challenge.<br/><br/>-Marshall                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154780/#Comment_154780" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T23:45:46+00:00" title="July  3, 2008 11:45PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not as I understand you.

Probably; I can't really be certain what you're hearing when I say certain things.  I mean, I've got an auditory processing disorder that, among other things, often makes it sound like someone said something they didn't ("<i>What</i> about a sandwich?"  "What?  I said 'Do you need a hand with that?'") so I'm painfully aware that there's all kinds of things that can go wrong in communication.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, "It must impress us <i>on an aesthetic level</i>" (I think the italicised bit is very important) is the boundary.  If that makes you shudder, well, I don't know what to say.  'Cause I have the same reaction to the stuff you're talking about <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Unless</i> the group's aesthetic preferences are such that someone might say something like, "Dude!  The way you exploited [insert rule here] that way?  That was beautiful!"

Ralph (as I understand him) is saying that he now believes he would have done better to behave differently, that his motivation was not one that he would act on nowadays, and that the outcome was not one that, in hindsight, was what he really wanted. I don't think any of that is usefully open to dispute.<br/><br/>You, OTOH, appear to be questioning the (possibly implied) statement that anyone who *appears* to be behaving like Ralph did then, regardless of circumstances, must inevitably be judged a prick. I don't think that's what he means to say, and I certainly wouldn't agree. Far too much depends on the context, the game, social expectations, etc. As you say, some people wouldn't be offended - they would just concede the loss, and then start discussions about how to fix a broken ruleset before playing again. And in a formal tournament the expectation would be that you win by any means that are within the rules, fun or not. But I have no doubt at all that Ralph's description is accurate, and that his assessment of the situation is correct. Maybe his friend wasn't very mature about it either. But them's the breaks...<br/><br/>Incidentally, on the subject of chess, the Soviet GM Petrosian was notorious for stirring his tea noisily for prolonged periods, etc. Unfortunately for his opponents, he was also rather deaf, so if they tried to retaliate in kind, he would simply turn his hearing aid off!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154980/#Comment_154980" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-05T10:46:15+00:00" title="July  5, 2008 10:46AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I helped run the University of Arizona chess club for a few years.

Now, the specific local ciruit I played in at the time didn't allow card sleeves on cards, but did allow a lot of really damn expensive cards.  So everyone good was playing with moxes and lotuses and all sorts of crazy shit.<br/><br/>The rules on tournaments kept a time limit on games.

This means driving toward character goals pretty aggressively, not just ambling around and kindasorta hoping to eventually get to the good stuff. Characters in motion. Characters that <i>care</i> about something, and are willing to take action to get it, and who are supported by the rules, the GM and the other players in doing so. "Supporting" may mean "vigorously opposing," but not simply shutting down--"nah, that doesn't work," "you can't do that," etc. Also, while aggressive, forward motion is the rule, downtime is cool as well. Having a rhythm to the story is good, but interminable campaigns that never seem to go anywhere or where PCs are bufeted by the whims of fate, are not.<br/><br/>Also note that "emotional engagement" doesn't have to mean "feeling what the character feels." It DOES mean being <i>invested</i> in what the character feels, just like a good story that draws you in.<br/><br/>So that's "Purpose," now for "Process":<br/><br/>I prefer procedures that are tied tightly to narrative, meaning I want to be able to attach a fictional description to more or less every instance of rules interaction. A bit or two like Fanmail is fine, but the majority of mechanics should have a fictional component welded to them. And not just tacked on implicitly! Like, each mechanical operation should actually ad something to the <i>story</i>, to the shared description of "what's happening." Just understanding as a group that rerolling your dice represents a surge of heroic determination (or whatever) isn't enough; I want an actual, engaged and excited description of how our bloodied hero rises to his feet, rage burning in his eyes, as orchestra music swells!<br/><br/>This tends to mean a fairly light level of crunch, though it varies with the ruleset and how well it bolsters narrative. But by and large, if there are to many fiddly bits it becomes hard to meld them to fictional input and the process bogs down. I guess whatever actual level of detail is present, the important thing is for the rules to be light on their feet.<br/><br/>Some specific mechanical biases: I dig rules that stat out more than physical and mental capableness, expanding into areas like the character's personality, what he cares about, destiny, and the like. Sometimes even eschewing capability tracking altogether, though I prefer a blend. What it boils down to is tracking what <i>matters</i> to the story we're telling, not "emulating the world" or "conforming to realism" or any such thing. I also like a ruleset that lets me handle any number of special circumstances, crazy stunts, or unusual powers, without piling on a fuck-ton of special case rules. That way we're using genuine creativity instead of rote memorization to create memorable moments of awesome.<br/><br/>I also want fairly aggressive scene framing with an emphasis on knowing where to <i>end</i>. I tire of endless navelgazing conversations that trail on and on, or mission planning that obsessively nails down every last little detail and possible wrinkle. I want conversations to be more like a movie or a book, where the exchange <i>ends</i> on the most dramatic note, instead of trickling out until everyone's sure they have nothing more to say. (Which of course precludes playstyles where getting the plan <i>just right</i> is important or you'll get screwed. I need both the plan <i>and</i> its results to be handled loosely.)<br/><br/>And finally, I want authority-apportioning that's fairly egalitarian, freeing for all and burdensome to none. This doesn't mean GMless necessarily (though it <i>can</i>), but a GMed game should allow the GM to be just one more player, bouncing stuff off the others and riffing off what she receives. She's another player with a specific set of authority and responsibility, sure, but that responsibility is more "hey, here's some stuff that should work well with your characters' shit" and less 'tis is what is in the world, whether you ever really interact with it and whether it ever allows your characters' goals and issues to be relevant." The GM's responsibility is to whip up a bunch of rough ideas and old them loosely, adjusting in play to player choices and spontaneous developments. Of course, it goes without saying that the ruleset absolutely must support this-see "light on its feet," above.<br/><br/>I think that covers it. I'll confess that I'm not totally confident in my description, mostly since this represents an ideal I'm searching for, as opposed to what I consistently get in my regular play. More than a few items above constitute a sort of wish-list: I've encountered it here and there, but in my regular group, not so much.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155434/#Comment_155434" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T11:33:50+00:00" title="July  8, 2008 11:33AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2008 11:35AM by Marshall Burns.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan,<br/>I'm sorry to be this blunt, but the way you're envisioning it is dead wrong.

You draw a line.  Inside that line is everything that is strictly legal by the rules.  Farther in (often much farther in, but sometimes even crossing outside) is another line.  Inside that line is everything that is appreciated and enjoyed by the other players.  The space between those two lines is labeled "because we care about each other as friends and people, not just opponents".  We could go there...but we won't...because ensuring the other players are enjoying themselves is just as important as trying to win.  In fact, one could add "and everybody has fun" to the "Victory Condition" of the game, that would cause the outer "its legal" line to slide to match the "its appreciated" line.  Eliminating the "its appreciated" line might be fine for tournament play with a bunch of strangers, or if I'm planning to make a $million bucks in the hard core world of competitive game playing...but its not how I intend to play with friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJoel, yeah, I like your definition of emotional engagement.  I'm alot more accepting of mechanics that operate on the meta level, though.  Often times I'd rather just imagine the "excited description of how our bloodied hero rises to his feet, rage burning in his eyes, as orchestra music swells!" rather than wait for the other player to stammer something out.  I've found that most people's ability to describe that isn't nearly as good as their ability to see it in their heads, so I'd rather have a brief abstract sketch that gets the game important facts down and then just let everyone visualize the colorful excitement for themselves.  Sort of how you mentioned you like the rules crunch to be "light on its feet", I like the narration to be "light on its feet"...give me the framework of what's going on and then get out of the way so my brain can play the scene in my head like a mental movie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155552/#Comment_155552" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T21:14:02+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  9:14PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2008 9:14PM by Joli.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's cool, Ralph. As far as the meta mechanics thing, I think that's somewhat a property of where I'm at at this point in my roleplaying life. I'm dissatisfied with flat roleplaying where rules interactions don't mesh well with the narration (either because the rules don't support it well, or because folks can't be bothered), so I'm really pushing for that. Once I've had that particular itch scratched some more, I may mellow out on the issue. Right now I'm enthused and somewhat driven, and really digging on games like Capes where <i>every rules element</i> (save Story Tokens) can be directly fused with a colorful description or pithy line.<br><br>I'll also note that it doesn't have to be <i>much</i> narration, necessarily. Again, it's about going all-out to get it in there at all, then backing off to a mellower comfort zone. So once we've established that spending an Awesome Point means you go all Rocky Balboa in the Final Round, then we can dial it down and convey that with a quick phrase or even just a knowing look.<br><br>Peace,<br>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6851/discussing-process-and-purpose-rather-than-content" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6851/discussing-process-and-purpose-rather-than-content" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6851/discussing-process-and-purpose-rather-than-content/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6851%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6851%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
