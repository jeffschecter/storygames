The original intent of Kickstarter was to help people who have an idea but who don't have a finished product gather the funding they need to finish the product and then produce it. Because people in the Story Games community (and other games producers in general) tend to use Kickstarter as a way to take finished ideas and publish them, we're used to seeing more complete, polished products.<br/><br/>And we're used to seeing such polished products because we're used to seeing Kickstarter used as a sales platform.<br/><br/>This isn't one of those. This is basically a charity donation to help them develop an education idea to help some kids learn math.<br/><br/>So it doesn't look as polished because it's not done yet. You're donating to help defray the costs of getting it done.<br/><br/>Also, Christian Brown, the main creative force behind the project (Aaron is more promoter than anything) is the nicest guy in the world. And an excellent game designer. And one of about 4 people in the country attempting to make his entire living as a professional larp designer/event producer. Which is pretty awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382237/#Comment_382237" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-13T17:54:39+00:00" title="June 13, 2012  5:54PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the additional details and corrections, Rob!

They help a lot.<br/><br/>Here's the explanation of stuff:<br/>Both Star Seekers and Hit Seekers are produced by Seekers Unlimited, a nonprofit (501c3 pending, and that's important to remember) company that I started last year; we officially incorporated in March.<br/><br/>To become a legit company, there are many costs: legal &amp; filing mainly, but many others; domain registry, business cards, etc. However, Kickstarter doesn't want to fund startups. It's project based, not company based. We'll be doing a more traditional fundraiser in August (in Los Angeles).  <br/><br/>I started SU after delving deep into live action role playing theory, especially Nordic Larp theory. I realized that larp is an art form (to me, at least), and could be used for non-entertainment purposes: research, business training and education, among others. I was heavily influenced by the classroom-stlye larps of Hogwarts and Space Cadets: Guardians of the High Frontier, two big larps that Enigma (UCLA SF club, which later became Enigma Live Game Labs and then Live Game Labs) produced. I was head of props on Hogwarts, lead designer on Space Cadets. <br/><br/>An essay on larp I wrote influenced J. Tuomas Harviainen, a Finnish larp theorist. It inspired him to write an essay for a German edu-larp book, LARP: Einblicke. He sent me a copy of the book. Only two essays in there were in English, but one of them was "Four Reasons Why Edu-larp Works" by Malik Hyltoft, one of the creators of \xd8sterskov Efterskole, a Danish all-larp boarding school. It set me afire with the desire to do something similar in America. <br/><br/>While I was processing all of the above, I was playing in Christian Brown's Starship Valkyrie campaign. It occurred to me that when pulling a repair card for a bridge console and arranging skills to fix it, the card could have a math problem on the back, and it could be used in a classroom. <br/><br/>Months later, we ran Star Seekers at a school in the valley.  On that, we took the basic Valkyrie idea and rewrote the content and story, and changed most mechanics. We pulled out character backgrounds and such, too. The students played themselves. There were four of us writing problems and such for that, and we all contributed (it wasn't just Christian). <br/><br/>After that, we had company birthing issues, which is where we are now (see the above comment on startup costs). <br/><br/>Hit Seekers came from Morgan Joeck, a founder of Seekers Unlimited (he wrote the math problems for Star Seekers). Morgan is a high school math teacher, and asked us to come in to his class. After observing the students, I came up with Hit Seekers and wrote the structure, plans, ideas, formulas, etc. Christian and I wrote all the NPCs (artists, producers, studios), about 60-40 in favor of him, and Morgan wrote the club-geometry problems (based on my idea, a simple problem I used to use when I tutored kids in math). <br/><br/>I have been the GM for Hit Seekers as well, maintaining the albums, writing up notes on the release, the twitter feed, running the numbers, etc. In ten minutes Christian is going to pick me up to take me to the last session of the game, when we award the prizes (gift cards that I bought with my own money yesterday) for the companies. We also have a guest speaker today, a music manager (that I arranged/booked). <br/><br/>And we'll be getting the kids' reactions and thoughts on camera today, too. I arranged for the cinematographer as well. He'll give me the footage, which I will edit tonight (after a nap), and post online on the Kickstarter page. <br/><br/>Finally, we're not giving too much detail about Hit Seekers because we're protecting the IP. I'd rather have someone hire us to design an edu-larp, or buy the game itself, than take our ideas and make their own. At least until we get funding, then we'll give away the golden goose. ;-)<br/><br/>As to taping the kids, it won't look as good as Star Seekers, and very few of the kids want to be on camera. We also need parental release forms to record them on camera, and I'm not sure how many of them have parents/guardians able to sign the forms. <br/><br/>I hope that answered all your questions and comments. <br/>Again, our kickstarter campaign is here: <a href="http://kck.st/Kb0aA1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://kck.st/Kb0aA1</a><br/><br/>Thanks for the interest!<br/><br/>Aaron<br/><br/>PS-Of the four people Rob mentioned trying to make a living designing larps, Christian--one of the nicest guys around--is one, and I am another. There's actually more than four; many site owners are able to eke out a living with a boffer campaign larp. Knight Realms, NERO, Ye Olde Commons, and a few more in the states. If you count Mind's Eye Theatre/Camarilla, there might be a few more. Oh, and Mac at Cthulhu Live. If you look outside America's borders, there are many more, especially in the Nordic countries, where they recognize larp as art and get government funding on a regular basis to make larps.<br/><br/>And here's Christian!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382767/#Comment_382767" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T22:55:48+00:00" title="June 18, 2012 10:55PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on board Aaron \u2013\xa0my donation just pushed it past $1,000.<br/><br/>We need Intercon to promote this: I'm sending some e-mails!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AaronJV" title="AaronJV"><img alt="AaronJV" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AaronJV">AaronJV</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382798/#Comment_382798" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-19T05:11:03+00:00" title="June 19, 2012  5:11AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Evan!<br/><br/>FYI:<br/>Our first update shows 1/2 of one of the artist cards, and our second one has video of the kids' reaction to the game. <br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/906612014/hit-seekers-a-math-game-in-the-music-industry/posts" rel="nofollow">(link here)</a><br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/>Aaron                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
