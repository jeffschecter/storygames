They made it to Nightport and confronted the local scoundrels to get information about the whereabouts of our infamous pirate king. I pulled the Mountain Witch Trick and said upon the mention of his name, everyone went quiet. There was a look of shock and terror on their faces. I asked them collectively "Why?"<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was the point where they were finally getting comfortable with adding details to the setting/story. They collectively decided he was amassing a fleet to oppose the Empire. His secret weapon: a phonograph recording of our wonderful Lady Blackbird's voice. He used this as a song to control the sky squid. This is the reason he was in love with her....she was his weapon. How does LB feel about being used like this? What are the ramifications of the knowledge that LB's song can control the squid? We will find out next session!<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion Time!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are three possible outcomes to a die roll:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) success of the die roll; success of the action<br/>\n2) failure of the die roll; success of the action BUT there is a condition<br/>\n3) failure of the die roll: ? of the action BUT there is a twist/escalation<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the "?" a success or failure? If the action is a fail, can they try again? For instance: the jail cell. If they fail, are they still locked in AND the alarm goes off? If they are able to try again, what if they fail again? And again? Same situation with the Owl being grappled by a sky squid. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor each obstacle, are the individual obstacles listed under the overarching obstacle minor hurdles that must collectively be overcome in succession to overcome the overarching obstacle? Or is it a choice of which obstacle to overcome to get past the entire thing? Maybe a mix of both?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_351996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/351996/#Comment_351996" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-19T22:39:44+00:00" title="December 19, 2011 10:39PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2011 10:40PM by noclue.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't allow them to try the same thing again, but I also wouldn't call for the roll at all unless I had something interesting in mind for a failure that really shakes things up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352196/#Comment_352196" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-21T17:19:58+00:00" title="December 21, 2011  5:19PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your number two is a rule from Mouse Guard, not Lady Blackbird. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The dice outcomes for LB are:<br/>1. Success: you overcome the obstacle.<br/>2. Fail: You don't overcome the obstacle, and the situation escalates.<br/><br/>There are no hard rules about trying again. If the situation allows you to try again, then you can. If not, not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
