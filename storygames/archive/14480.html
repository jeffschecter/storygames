I've got them all, but I haven't gone super-deep into SSS. Anything specific that you're looking for?<br/><br/>BoL focuses a lot on "previous lives your character has had" and they come up in every roll. "Farmer: 1; Poisoner-Assassin: 2; Soldier 1; Scribe 2" etc. It is also the one that feels the most "Conan" of the bunch, but that was specifically what the author was aiming for. The art is fucking magnificent as well, it's like French Hanna-Barbara.<br/><br/>SSS (again, haven't read through it front to back) offers a simplistic adventure game experience (well, they all do to some degree, but SSS really focuses on it) and has a sanity mechanic. It's also cheap as hell for the print version. It features no setting that I can tell. <br/><br/>JotSS is loosely based on the system behind Dead Inside and Swashbucklers of the Seven Skies. It's got a great, comprehensive magic system. The rules system is the "wordiest" of the bunch, involving lots of abilities where if you describe them well you can use them. It's got a great setting attached, too.<br/><br/>I would say that SSS focuses on the traditional adventure game the most while keeping things really simple. BoL focuses on being the Conan RPG, and does so very well with few rules. JotSS is a more "leaning towards hippie" game with a wordy rules-system and a unique setting.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329539/#Comment_329539" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T22:43:47+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 10:43PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Anything specific that you're looking for?</blockquote>\nSo, if we have a spectrum of D&amp;D4e at one end which is a great encounter driven tactical adventure game and at the other end of the spectrum you have Sorcerer &amp; Sword which all about character driven weird fantasy stories I'm looking for something kind of in the middle.  My "go to" game for Swords and Sorcery role-playing is of course Sorcerer &amp; Sword but sometimes I just don't want to think about Humanity and Demons and Kickers and all that.  Once in a blue-moon I just kind of want to fight a giant snake.<br/><br/>D&amp;D3.5 pretty much perfectly delivers the kind of experience I'm looking for in terms of tone and play BUT it's just WAY, WAY too complicated.  Man, once I'm prepped and ready to go it's awesome but hours and hours and hours of applying the Cleric class to my Naga to create that snake priestess I want in the final fight is EXHAUSTING.<br/><br/>D&amp;D4e is MUCH better but it's still just a TAD over long in the planning process.  Not to mention the MAZE of products, updates and options.  It doesn't seem like I can "just" play D&amp;D4e without some serious decision making on what parts of D&amp;D4e I want to allow.  Also tonally it's kind of more crazy mythic than what I'm looking for.  Essentials seems to do a nice job of reining this in a bit.<br/><br/>So I'm looking for something that has a nice team/tactical feel to it but only takes a few hours to work up a nice 6 to 8 encounter scenario.  I've looked at almost all the retro-clones like Labyrinth Lord, Basic Fantasy and Dark Dungeons but the problem with those is that they really are old-school D&amp;D with all the baggage that entails.<br/><br/>So of the three, it sounds like Shadow, Sword and Spell might be worth a look.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329547/#Comment_329547" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T00:21:02+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:21AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jesse,<br/><br/>At the risk of self-promoting, you might like my game <a href="http://onmightythews.com/" rel="nofollow">On Mighty Thews</a>. It's maybe not tactical or crunchy enough for what you want, and its got a Donjon thing happening which you either like or you don't, but it's a no-prep swords and sorcery game where you can just fight a snake if you want to, and it doesn't have to mean too much, but it will mean something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329550/#Comment_329550" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T01:18:47+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  1:18AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IMO, SS&amp;S is kind of... bad. I own it, but I regret having purchased it. Admittedly, I've only played it once, but there were some things about it that really bugged me. Also admittedly, those things may be, like, absolutely inconsequential to someone else -- maybe even you! -- but to me they were stoppers.<br/><br/>One of them, as I recall (this was last year), was the way skills work. There's a huge difference, way too huge, between being trained and untrained in a skill, but it's also very confusing sorting out just what that difference is. The author himself seemed to have trouble explaining it over the course of (I'm going to say) 100-200 posts in a long RPG.net thread. All in all, it just felt like a rather poorly thought-out game, and that alone really turned me off of it.<br/><br/>BoL: Own it. Awesome. Simple, fun, I'd play it anytime. Magic is really well done and very much captures that S&amp;S feel.<br/><br/>J6S: Own it. More complicated than BoL, but a good variant of PDQ that fits the genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329572/#Comment_329572" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T06:37:14+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  6:37AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse: With those criteria in mind, I would actually aim for Barbarians of Lemuria first.

(The magic system was really  good, though.)  <br/><br/>We tried PDQ# as used in <i>Swashbucklers of the 7 Skies</i> later and had no problems with it, but that's a little bit more complicated than the PDQ system as used in JotSS.

Your character's fictional position is very important, and you can certainly track it with miniatures, but it's not on a grid or anything.

Very much simplified D&amp;D-style adventure, with a good dose of heroics (particularly when your skills hit above 20), fast, easy, and very very fun, and incorporates minis as part-and-parcel to the game. And it is free!!! They're putting the finishing touches on the English translation of the 4th edition rules (originally in German, and the 4e rules simply add more character options and a ton of new spells, rather than changing up the entire game like another 4e we know). But the 3.5 rules are available, as well as several supplments that add potions, firearms, more equipment, mildly more complicated combat, etc. (and if you're interested, I have a PDF copy of the supplement that adds spells, just whisper me an e-mail and I'll send it your way).<br/>I have played the heck out of DungeonSlayers, and enjoy it more than most of the official D&amp;D games and their clones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329646/#Comment_329646" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T11:09:01+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 11:09AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 11:09AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, too, find this compelling.

None of the three that you brought up as samples do anything like the above, and didn't mean to either.<br/><br/>Well, I dunno about SSS. But BoL was clearly made with the conceit, "I want a much simpler game to reflect Conan/Conan-era pulp stories, and nothing else does the job." Nothing in there was "I want to make a better/easier/cheaper D&amp;D". Jaws of the Six Serpents was created for much of the same reasons that Clinton created the World of Near for TSOY, and not for any "old school vibe" reasons at all.  So the three choices you made for games were probably out of your goal-reach to start out with.<br/><br/>But something that DOES keep maps (narrative maps you create on the fly, mind) and minis (for placement in those map zones) and does all those things above, while peeling away from clearly D&amp;D roots, is Red Box Hack.

Can we talk a little more about it? I love the idea of slick, fast-moving maps and minis board components.</blockquote>\nSure, using the 3.5 SRD I've (mostly) already mostly figured out how to do it on the player's side.  It looks something like this:<br/><br/>Dump non-Human races because I like Humanistic fantasy.<br/>Pre-build all the classes by filling in the appropriate feats for the class's task, dump all other feats. <br/>Fighter is a sword and shield guy.  <br/>Ranger is an archer guy.<br/>Rogue is the sneaky/two weapon guy<br/>For Clerics dump Domains<br/>For Wizards dump Schools and Familiars.<br/>Strip down the spell lists to combat essentials.<br/><br/>For general combat rules:<br/><br/>Keep Flanking Rules<br/>Use 4e style Defenses<br/>Use 4e style cover &amp; concealment<br/>Use 4e grappling.<br/>Use 4e style opportunity attacks.<br/>Basically strip everything down to 4e like essentials.<br/><br/>The problem is, that I haven't figured out how to do that with Monster and Encounter design.  Like if I want a 5th level Naga Priestess how do I get there in under 15 minutes?  If I want a interesting 7th Level Necromancy flavored cultist acompanied by 5 4th level giant spiders how do I construct that quickly and efficiently.<br/><br/>I generally don't like locking my imagination in at levels.  It's one of the things I liked about 3e (I could scale creatures and apply templates so if I wanted 3rd level characters fighting Nagas that were usually 7th level I could jigger that) and 4e is much more forgiving in that you can throw a 5th level monster at a 1st level party and they have a fighting chance.  But doing all that scale work is exhaustingly complex.<br/><br/>I want something where I can pick a "level appropriateness" and then assemble powers from a budget or something like that.  It's like I'd like "Monster Powers" separate from the monsters itself or something like that.  So if I want a 1st Level Beholder I just run down the chart of 1st level versions of all it's abilities.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329662/#Comment_329662" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T11:44:18+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 11:44AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 11:46AM by Jesse.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>If you could write down a list of "sweet spot" items you're looking for, what would that list be?</blockquote>\nSo, you know how when you think back on D&amp;D what you remember is mind-boringly long combats where there's a lot of sitting around waiting your turn?  In my experience 3e and 4e aren't like that but you have to set the game up correctly.  When you don't do dumb things like tell players they can't help each other when it's not their turn, you get this fierce energy at the table.  People are shouting at each other, "Okay, yeah, use your fireball this turn!  No wait!  Next turn, the rogue needs to get out of the way first!  Oh crap, but that will provoke an opportunity attack from the Ogre!  Fuck!  We're boxed in!"<br/><br/>You also need to have a *little* more at stake than *just* the fight.  And I really do mean a *little*.  I remember running an adventure where the players were going up a mountain to a Temple to rescue a woman who had been kidnapped by Naga.  Along the way there was a rope bridge and the canyon below is obscured by mist.  Well, just BELOW the mist is a giant spider that has spun a huge web across the canyon.  Halfway across the bridge, it breaks and the characters have to make saving throws.  Those who fail end up in the web.  Those who succeed end up on basically a rope ladder with a giant spider climbing up behind them.<br/><br/>Similarly the end fight in the temple opens with the Naga Priestesses dumping the woman the PCs are there to rescue into a pit with snake god.  So they have to fight the encounter on two levels.  The Snake Priestesses and their guards in the table and the giant snake in the pit which is about to kill the objective of the scenario.<br/><br/>But it took me like 5 hours to create that final fight.  I had to apply the Cleric Class to the Nagas.  I think I also had to scale ALL the Nagas up or down a few levels because this was a 10th level encounter and Nagas by default are a little lower than that.  I then had to find a Giant Snake and apply the Infernal Template to it.  It was a great encounter but it took me forever to put it together.  And that was just ONE encounter in a 13 location map.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329676/#Comment_329676" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T12:14:52+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:14PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I'm not mistaken, it's the GM prep -- specifically, balancing the counters -- that seems to be the big problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329680/#Comment_329680" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T12:23:41+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:23PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>If I'm not mistaken, it's the GM prep -- specifically, balancing the counters -- that seems to be the big problem.</blockquote>\nYup.  Before 4e I would have said that there was a lot of crazy cumbersome stuff in in the basics of combats as well.  Lots and Lots of micro-exceptions like how Undead, Plants and Constructs are immune to critical hits.  Or how Cover and Concealment work differently.  One is a penalty on your roll, the other is a percentile miss chance even if you hit.  But 4e solved A LOT of that.<br/><br/>4e tried to solve the encounter design problem as well but unless you are sticking strictly to the monsters provided it's still a lot of work.  It's WAY faster than 3e (and it doesn't scale with nightmarish complexity as you go up) but it's still quite a bit of work.  I recently wrote a 1st Level scenario in which I wanted cultists, assassins and wraiths.  I had to build the cultists (two different types) and assassins from scratch and I had to scale down the wraiths to appropriate level.  Took me the better part of two days, and I'm still not 100% done.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329683/#Comment_329683" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T12:30:02+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:30PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a weird, probably stupid, question:<br/><br/>Someone hasn't built some sort of Magical Spreadsheet that let's one just plug in the numbers/levels/etc that one wants, and then you just paint the color you want on top of the numbers for the encounter?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329692/#Comment_329692" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T12:51:24+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Someone hasn't built some sort of Magical Spreadsheet that let's one just plug in the numbers/levels/etc that one wants, and then you just paint the color you want on top of the numbers for the encounter?</blockquote>\nActually, Wizards of the Coast, provides one... sort of.  First of all you have to subscribe to it ($9.00 a month) and second of all it isn't very good.  I went ahead and tried it.  Here's what I found.<br/><br/>There are two Monster Builders.  The old one which has a lot of cool features and the new one that barely does anything.  Only the new one is 100% up to date.  Also the Monster Builder isn't integrated with the Character Builder very well, so constructing monster versions of regular NPCs is tough.  Here's what I had to do.<br/><br/>For the cultists and assassins I had to use the Character Builder to make them.  Then I took one At-Will Power, their highest level Encounter Power, plus all the relevant racial/class traits and typed that into the old Monster Builder.  That formatted the creature correctly for me so I could cut and paste it into my word document.<br/><br/>For the Wraith, I found the one I wanted in the new Monster Builder which at least has the level scaling feature but alas has no way to cut and paste the information out of it.  So I had to type that info into the old Monster Builder so I could get it in the right format over to my word document.<br/><br/>What made, say old Red/Blue Box Monsters so great was that a lot of stuff about monsters was standardized by hit dice.  So you only needed to jot down things like "R. Dragon, AC 0, HP 45, Breath 10 feet, 3d8 dam, Sav half"  You could conceivable have your entire encounter key fit in the margin of your map.  But 3e and 4e work off all the same values at PCs so you need to have all those values on hand.<br/><br/>Which probably where the problem is.  What I'm looking for is something that has the tactical depth of 3e/4e but with the notepad footprint of Red Box.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329703/#Comment_329703" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T13:16:39+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  1:16PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So uh</p>\n<p>why not just use the CB and reskin powers as needed?</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson" title="Mike_Olson"><img alt="Mike_Olson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Olson">Mike_Olson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329709/#Comment_329709" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T13:41:33+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  1:41PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Old-School Hack is something of a cross between Red Box Hack and Danger Patrol -- or maybe that's just me. Anyway, there's a visual component and the potential for very simple use of minis (basically "My guy is here"). Space is divided into arenas, and there are different kinds of them: tight arenas don't give a lot of space to maneuver, hazardous arenas have environmental dangers, etc. Weapons have properties that key off of those arena types, so light weapons are better in tight arenas because they're more agile, while ranged weapons are better in open arenas.<br/><br/>Everything else is dirt-simple and a little bit of a parody, both of which are fine by me.<br/><br/>Personally, I found the 4E Monster Builder to be pretty awesome, but I think that was back before they updated/worsened it (much like the old, offline version of the Character Builder is better in just about every way than the new, online-only one). I used it to gin up a fair number of monsters from scratch or modify existing ones without much difficulty. It did/does require being able to eyeball them for balance, though, which isn't always intuitive.<br/><br/>What about Savage Worlds? Rules-medium, makes allowances for minis but doesn't require them, has a few good fantasy-type settings (Sundered Skies and Hellfrost, specifically), very well-supported (if you care about that sort of thing)... seems to fit the bill.<br/><br/>Honestly though, to me, that cool naga fight you described sounds like it could happen in just about any system, really. I don't see the need for breaking things down in five-foot squares to make that scene work and be as exciting as it was. In our long-running, highly lethal, bordering-on-abusive 3.5 game a few years ago, we had some epic, <i>epic </i>fights, but I can only think of one where minis and precise positioning really made them exciting. (The one exception was trapping a vampire in the middle of all of us and exposing him to sunlight.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Forest" title="Rich Forest"><img alt="Rich Forest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2304/2385429537_23274b76cf.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Forest">Rich Forest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329711/#Comment_329711" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T14:20:08+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  2:20PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>What I'm looking for is something that has the tactical depth of 3e/4e but with the notepad footprint of Red Box.</blockquote>\nThis probably isn't all that useful since it's well out of print, but this sounds like <i>The Fantasy Trip</i> to me.

It has enough crunch and mechanics (fun ones at that) to make the combat fun to play in and of itself, but it is still light and flexible enough that you aren't locked into pre-designed templates.  One of its major selling points is the minimal amount of prep work required.  You will be fine with just the Explorer's Edition, but getting the Fantasy Companion would make your even easier.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of both Jaws of the Six Serpents and especially BoL, but I think you would find them a bit light in the mechanics department.  Mechanically, fights are very simple and samey, which is not a problem if your group is happy with lots of flavour sitting on top of an abstract combat mechanic.  But if you want to sink your teeth into some gamey fightey mechanics without all the work of WotC's products, Savage Worlds is the way to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329775/#Comment_329775" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T18:17:33+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  6:17PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 6:18PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know <i>Savage Worlds</i>, so I'm not dismissing it... <br/>but the thought of <i>The Fantasy Trip</i> find really compelling.<br/><br/>Jesse will be here in fifteen minutes for our <i>Sorcery &amp; Sword</i> SAVAGE BORN game, so I'll run <i>The Fantasy Trip</i> by him and see if it makes sense for him.<br/><br/>(Last week, before play started, Jesse, Colin and I ended up with a long discussion about the old <i>Ravenloft</i> modules, then a long discussion about <i>Pendragon</i>, and then a long discussion about the kind of play the <i>FATE</i> system engenders.

I don't get why exactly-- it looks really appealing on paper, but under three different GMs the game just grinds to a complete screeching halt every time the maps and minis come out.  The last time I played, it took more than two hours to resolve a battle between four PCs vs 8-10 mooks &amp; 1 Wild Card.  I've only played in modern or supers settings so I don't know how well it handles fantasy/melee combat, but I suspect it would be even more of a whiff-tastic slog, because melee defense values are much higher than ranged (the target number for melee attacks involves the target's Fighting skill, but the TN for ranged is a flat 4, which basically means everyone who can carries a gun or shoots beams and I'll stop here before I rant about how bad Necessary Evil is as a supers ruleset).<br/><br/>I want to second the Empire of Dust recommendation (assuming you can either groove on its Thundarr the Barbarian/Thundercats/Final Fantasy groundbound space opera vibe or just reskin everything, but there are definitely minotaur-men and various monster-critters even in the default setting), I ran that once and thought its maps&amp;minis combat was great.  It is definitely not a game for everyone, but if you like the idea of a skill-and-feat-based rules-medium system without HP attrition-based combat that can quickly or even randomly generate combat encounters and battlefields with destructible terrain, check it out.  The game is technically out of print (which is a shame, since part of the charm is having the actual tokens for "stealthed/invisible", "on fire", etc), but IPR was selling the PDF last time I checked, and Clint Krause may still have a physical copy or two left.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329914/#Comment_329914" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T09:35:40+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  9:35AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>Correct me if I'm wrong, but the reason to be so careful about balancing the encounters is because the combat system is brutal and dispassionate? The other way to address the brutality of combat would be a system that's still rich with possible nuances of monster and combat adversity, but more fault tolerant of flukes and bad decisions by players.

Problem is, I never finish anything I start. =/<br/>\n<br/>\nSG needs to start up a new contest where folks finish other peoples' nearly completed games. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330120/#Comment_330120" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T19:12:16+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  7:12PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Legends of Anglerre has some components of changing distance, which is intended to put some challenge into an abstract combat, but you could still implement that with minis, having to make rolls to get into range or out of range depending on how the opponent moves, but without throwing any other tedious stuff like AoOs or worrying about whether a burst would hit your ally or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330181/#Comment_330181" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T08:16:48+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  8:16AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2011 8:17AM by Neil.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>It's funny because it seems like all the attempts to capture that old-skool D&amp;D adventure feel always try to strip out the minis component.

Pay attention to the joints, such as how losing a fight doesn't ever fuck your whole game up (thus removing the need for careful "balance", actually).</li>\n</ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330214/#Comment_330214" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T10:36:20+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 10:36AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread has been great!<br><br>I wanted to thank everyone for their suggestions.
