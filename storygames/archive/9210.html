(Actually, it came out a coupel years ago at a film festival, but it's just being released now in the U.S.)<br/><br/>Besides just the name, it seems very much like 3:16, only somewhat different: in the movie (from what I can gather via the trailer) earth is destroyed so the earth military goes and finds an innocent peace loving planet called Terra, and decides to kill everything on it and take it for their own. Cue soldiers with moral issues, massive explosions, etc.<br/><br/>Anyways, looks like an interesting twist on the standard 3:16 formula to me. I'd play it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
