The situation posited was that some people want to play a sci-fi horror game and others want to play a gritty dark-ages horror game and I was thinking "why can't we do both, set in the same universe" and do a little mythos-style time-bendy cross-space craziness to link them together.  I want actions in the past to change the future and for psychic weirdness to resonate across time.  <br/><br/>Thoughts?  Am I insane?  Will that help?  Has anyone else done something like this?  <br/><br/>We're thinking of using Stars Without Number and Lamentations of the Flame Princess (with the elves, dwarves, clerics, etc filed off), a bit of hacking and with Carcosa likely jammed in between.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379964/#Comment_379964" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T13:56:44+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  1:56PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did that once. Alternated between a supers game, a Mythos investigation, and then a postapocalyptic game where the eighties heroes met the Prohibition-era gumshoes in a nuclear wasteland. Definitely doable! <br/><br/>In my case, we started by establishing connections between each player's characters in the different realities (ancestry, major events that one character would participate in, affecting future timelines). Then we played three- or four-game sessions of each world (rather than a one-shot here and a one-shot there; this let us build up each storyline a bit before merging them).<br/><br/>We also built in some questions -- for example, Blackout (a superhero who controlled darkness) got his powers from some Lovecraftian tome or something, and we later found out why (by playing through an investigation in the 1920s).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379965/#Comment_379965" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T13:59:36+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  1:59PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think it's a cool idea. Depending on how you do it, and how bothered you are about excessive realism, you might find causality problematic. You also might conceivably find that nobody really gets the game they want and you just end up with a kind of bland mix of everything rather than a single strong genre. But the only way to find out is to try!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the reason I commented is that I have in fact played in such a game, though only as a one-off. It was a linked cyberpunk/edwardian (I don't know if it was actually edwardian, I'm just naming a random time period that sounds about right to me) game. The characters could travel through a special kind of magical painting. The game sounded immensely cool but crashed and burned because the GMs hadn't considered how the two worlds would interact. The cyberpunk people found out about the edwardians and decided to imprison them - cyberpunk paranoia not mixing terribly well with genteel edwardianness. I guess arguably this was just down to players being crap to each other, which could happen to any game, but the lesson I took from it was always to pay attention to the dynamics favouring cooperation or betrayal between players and set things up to get the kind of game you want. (Betrayal is fine if it's a game about betrayal, and if everyone is cool with it; not so much if, as in this case, you want a more cooperative sort of game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379967/#Comment_379967" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T14:13:27+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  2:13PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An italian writer called Valerio Evangelisti uses this technique in every single book of "Eymerich, the inquisitor".<br/><br/>There are always three timelines, one in the middle ages, where the ruthless Eymerich is hunting down some heretic, free thinker or devil worshipper; another one in modern times, where the dark consequences of the past start manifesting, usually in the course of some war (WW2, Iraq, .); finally a future distopic apocalyptic timeline explains - from the point of view of psi-science - what really happened and takes it to its extreme consequences.<br/><br/>I know it's available in italian and french.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379969/#Comment_379969" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T14:50:07+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  2:50PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haiku Wars does this, but I have a feeling that's not exceptionally helpful.<br/><br/>I've had experience doing this at conventions, but we've always played the games sequentially.  The actions in one game feed into decisions on the next feed into consequences feed into..  on to the final game of the series.<br/><br/>This is a totally workable model, especially if you can pick a game based on theme or emotional impact you want it to have.  Game 5 (of 9) for us was Misspent Youth, for instance, because we wanted a blinding anger towards the MAN, but we wanted to sneak in themes of togetherness and betrayals.<br/><br/>Are you talking about skipping back and forth between multiple timelines/genres?  Have you looked into Acts of Evil?  It may help a bit.

That sort of thing.  So in the dark ages game, maybe they're investigating the ritual slaughter of a village and find that the strange cult involved worships a glassy sphere that hums with maddening music and in the space game, that cult has become a system-spanning conspiracy or massive religion and the characters have to prevent them from gaining direct access to the psychic dust-cloud that makes up their strange god.  <br/><br/>Definitely, for us, it'll be about using the themes (cosmic horror) in both games and tying the characters together.  Mostly I'm interesting in concepts like long-term evolution of adversaries and about how the actions of one set of PCs can affect the other.  I may also have some kind of "space out of time" thing going on where like, the Eternal City lies unchanging in some nether realm outside both timelines.                        </div>\n<div
