It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s geared towards a attribute + skill game. The idea behind it is in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4094" rel="nofollow">this thread.</a> At this point, since there are no stats, there is also no rolling. Unless something doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t fit the genre (modern thriller), the action is automatically successful. If it doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t fit the genre, and no way to make it fit can be found, it automatically fails.<br/><br/>Layout of the scene (and all future scenes, unless something else rears its head) will be:\n<ul><li>Purpose: why the scene is here, both in terms of the story and in terms of filling out the character sheets.</li>\n<li>Setup: describes the start of the scene in as vague of terms as possible</li>\n<li>Options: lays out some possible choices the PCs may take, and what stat gets boosted if they do. This is just some stuff that's been added as possibilities. If they go another route and it fits the genre, have at it.</li>\n<li>Exits: Ways to leave the scene and proceed to the next</li></ul>\nThe scenes are more railroad-y than I prefer, but the character sheet filling kinda requires it. They could be filled with impromptu gaming as well, and almost certainly will be in some places, so the scenes provide a blueprint but not a finished product.<br/><br/>As much as possible I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to describe scenes in terms of Schr\xc3\xb6dinger\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Scenery. That is, scenery and NPCs which are only given the briefest of description, and filled in based on the players\xe2\u20ac\u2122 questions. So instead of a \xe2\u20ac\u0153sturdy, metal cot\xe2\u20ac\x9d it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s just a cot. If at all possible, try to answer the questions in a way that reacts positively to the PC\xe2\u20ac\u2122s plan. If they ask how big the air duct is, they probably want to climb through it, so it needs to be big enough that it is usable.<br/><br/>For bonuses given, if a character assists another in a task, they get half the boost, while the character suggesting it still gets the full amount. <br/><br/>Just keep running tallies right now. Character sheets are filled in at the end of the adventure.<br/><br/><b>Purpose</b><br/>In game: Introduce the PCs to one another. Escape the immediate captivity of the cell.<br/><br/>Out of Game: Gives opportunities for social interaction, athletics, contortionism, investigation, lock picking, and more. Can result in combat if the players want it to, but the first guaranteed combat scene is phase 2.<br/><br/><b>Setup</b><br/>You wake up in what appears to be barracks or a cell, with no memory of who you are or why you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re here. You look around the room and see ___ other people filling the cots in the room.<br/><br/><i>(have players describe themselves): This will help to determine some basic attributes. There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s way too many possibilities to try to cover them all, but in general \xe2\u20ac\u0153big and burly\xe2\u20ac\x9d would give more strength and stamina, \xe2\u20ac\u0153lithe\xe2\u20ac\x9d or \xe2\u20ac\u0153wiry\xe2\u20ac\x9d would give dex, \xe2\u20ac\u0153handsome\xe2\u20ac\x9d gives appearance, and glasses give intelligence.</i><br/><br/>Describe the room:\n<ul><li>One cot per person</li>\n<li>Each person is wearing plain blue overalls</li>\n<li>Air duct in the ceiling</li>\n<li>Door is sturdy wood, locked</li>\n<li>Through the door can be heard a TV playing. Every now and then someone argues with it.</li></ul>\nFlesh out the description of the room based on the questions the players ask, going around the table until the room has been fleshed out fully, making sure that everyone gets the same number of questions. Keep questions focused on the room and it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s contents.<br/><br/><i>(have players write down their ideal escape plan. It cannot rely on assistance from outside the room): The plans themselves are used to award points as per the options below. After plans are turned in, have the players discuss their plans. The social interaction will award Charisma, Presence, etc., depending on who says what. </i><br/><br/><b>Options</b><br/>Some actions are more difficult than others. For just trying the action the PC gets a boost in that area. When they try, describe the action as being very difficult, and then ask if they succeed. If they do, they get the larger boost to their skill.\n<table border="1"> <tr> <td> <b>Action</b> </td> <td><b>In Game Results</b> </td> <td><b>Character Changes</b> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interrogate Other Players  </td> <td>Depends on players  </td> <td>+1 Investigation  </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Try to get others to  follow your plan  </td> <td>Depends on players  </td> <td>+1 Command  </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Successfully get others to  follow the plan  </td> <td>Depends on players  </td> <td>+1 Charisma, +2 command  </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Strongly resist someone  else\xe2\u20ac\u2122s plan  </td> <td>Depends on players  </td> <td>+1 Integrity  </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Steadfastly refuse to  follow other plans  </td> <td>Depends on players  </td> <td>+2 Integrity  </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Get in a physical fight  with other PCs  </td> <td>Depends on players  </td> <td>+1 melee, thrown, or brawl  </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Question guard  </td> <td>Learn that the guards have  orders not to kill anyone.
