That is just it.<br/><br/>Jeff and I decided to keep our show very positive and at times I kind of regret that.  A voice of criticism is an important thing.  Without it, shit is going to fall flat.<br/><br/>Jay Walton has a good point, though.  I wouldn't want a small group of vocal folks speaking for everyone or acting as gate-keepers or some shit.  That is crap.<br/><br/>But there has got to be something.  The fact that Ron said that Shock: needed a once-over and Alexander played it and had trouble with the text and was vocal about it led to Joshua releasing the new version and the new version has been at the helm of more hours of fun gaming than any other game this year.  That is a big YAY for Joshua for cowboying up and re-writing things but also a big YAY to Ron and Alexander for being active and aggressive players who not only high-five when things are awesome but scratch their heads IN PUBLIC and give solid critique.<br/><br/>As usual, I think this kind of criticism has to come out of play.  It shouldn't be some blog where reviews happen, unless those reviews are AP reviews.<br/><br/>Publish -&gt; Play -&gt; Dialogue -&gt; Refine<br/><br/>But I'm open to other solutions to this riddle.

It can, and often will, turn to shit.  Maybe that's too pessimistic, but it's pessimism borne of experience.<br/><br/>From elsethread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>I'm fine with taking some stuff to the public stage<i>after</i>it's been vetted in a few one on one conversations (my preferred mode of receiving criticism) or within a trusted circle.  This is actually one of the things I really liked about the peer feedback groups in Game Chef: it kept the number of critic-cooks in the kitchen to a managable size.<br/><br/>It's full on open public critiquing that I think is damn near impossible to pull off well on the internet.  Because it takes too much work in such a venue to achieve the benefits that are far easier to attain in the aforementioned smaller ones.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I'm not arguing (or at least, not<i>intending to argue</i>-- I'll own that I might have done so without thinking about it) against the need for critique.  I'm arguing about the<i>venue</i>where it works best.<br/><br/>Something like the Master Mines -- or, I guess, the "Owlbear idea", though I'm not sure what that is -- is doing it right, I think: creating a smaller, focused discussion group around a small number of games, as a method for improving those games for their release.  Hell, that's essentially what the Forge used to be until it got flooded by its own success, right?</blockquote>\nAs a species we are absolute crap at safeguarding each others' emotions when we have even the slightest whiff of anonymity the way the internet provides it.  Give me a face to face conversation, or at least a one on one IM chat, to tell me what parts of my game are crap and I'm 100 times likelier to take it well (in part because you're 100 times likelier to frame it better since you know you have an audience of one -- me).

In my ideal world, that's the real end-state of the more isolated critique-sessions.<br/><br/>Think about Ron Edwards' Brain Damage kerfluffle of old.  He was having that conversation in public, though in talking with him about it afterwards, the fact that it was public was pretty much accidental; he intended the conversation to be small, controlled, among a trusted circle.  But it wasn't.  It was on the fucking internet, and people got upset about it, and then I flew in there to make sure I had a chance to be another poo-flinging monkey (and boy, did I fling it).<br/><br/>What if that had happened as a more private conversation which was then followed by a more controlled public conversation covering its *conclusions* rather than the whole mess of thought from start to finish?

Nothing is beyond criticism. This is something I tell my students all the time, and I think it's an important thing to remember. If you look hard enough, you can always find something to pick at, something to point to, something to criticize. So approaching a piece of art or finished project with criticism in mind can be tricky. Not everything NEEDS to be criticized. Or rather, there's no reason to go looking for faults in an otherwise fine piece of work. <br/><br/>Now, I'm not saying that this is what anyone is doing, but saying that everything should be held up for fair criticism (which is great) very often leads to works being examined solely for their flaws, and those flaws being presented as the representation of the work as a whole.<br/><br/>It's really easy to say that our community won't do this, especially since no one wants to. But it will happen (and has happened, I think). Returning to the example of my students, I can see this behavior very, very clearly when we participate in group criticism. Each student will display their current project (a painting, illustration, cartoon, etc), and students will make critical comments about the work. I usually lead off with a few comments of my own in order to set the tone. What invariably happens is that after the first few comments, students start looking for things to criticize. Instead of absorbing the work as a whole and appreciating it for what it is, they look for any weakness in the work that they can present to the class. In looking for a fault, they miss the larger picture.<br/><br/>Anyway...<br/><br/>My point here isn't that we shouldn't be critical. But that we should make sure that we're not looking for things to criticize. And to recognize that this is an easy behavior to fall into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128804/#Comment_128804" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T16:11:39+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  4:11PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 4:12PM by Ben_Lehman.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd:<br/><br/>I wanna say something, cause some of your first post bugs me.<br/>By the time that Alexander and Ron were going off on Shock: in public, Joshua and I were already well into the rewrite.

This is what I try to do on Master Mines.  This is what I try to do any time I read a game currently in development.

So, allow me to extend the metaphor:  I can talk to you about how to be prettier before you hit the ball.  Once you're there, I can't do anything to help you be prettier, but I am going to use what I see to help me be prettier in the future.<br/><br/>Frankly, that's what you're going to get from me soon -- talk about what lessons I am taking away from these books that I feel are sub-par.

I'm going to focus on what these books have communicated to me about the craft of bookmaking, and sharing those lessons with my audience as bookmakers.<br/><br/>So, pre-publication, I'm talking with the designer about the present; post-publication, I'm talking with the world about the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128822/#Comment_128822" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T17:22:49+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  5:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If we don't honestly and earnestly criticize each other's games than we are going to find ourselves knee-deep in weak-ass games.

It'll be like the glory days of White Wolf, or the current days of Microsoft.<br/><br/>So, when I say "critique" or "playtesting" in the following, I'm talking about pre-publication critique.  I think if you want to increase quality across the indie publishing scene, that's when you need to introduce feedback -- before the games are exposed to the cold light of the public internet.<br/><br/>I've criticized a lot of fiction and playtested a few games, so I hope people believe me when I say this: Fiction critique is <b>crazy, difficult, time-consuming work.</b>  It requires divination of the exact intent of the author (which is much harder than it sounds), knowledge of the conventions of the author's genre, and the ability to dismiss your prejudices and relate only those reactions that help the author achieve their intent within their chosen genre.  <br/><br/>This is much, much different than reviewing.  A review is a just guess at how a certain audience will react to a work.  Good critique provides a roadmap to victory.  A review just tells you whether you got there or not.<br/><br/>The people who are good at critique have practiced and practiced and practiced at it.  The most effective critiquers I've seen have decades invested in their skills.  For me, it was exhausting, and when I did it lots, it made me not want to read for pleasure.<br/><br/>So, yeah. Fiction critique is hard.  And game critique is at least as hard, and requires much <b>more</b> investment in time and energy.  You gotta read, you gotta gather your group, you gotta play some sessions, you gotta write up the responses, you gotta discuss them, etc.  If you're going to do it well, you've got to have some serious love in your heart for your hobby.<br/><br/>The really sad thing is, even that powerful love cannot guarantee that the critique will be useful to the recipient.    And even if it is useful, there's no guarantee that they'll even pay attention to it.  My wildass guestimate is that maybe 1% of what I offered to other writers was useful to them.  When my own work was being critiqued, perhaps 10% of what I received really clicked with me.  It's possible that number should have been much higher, though.  Filtering and processing critique is a skill too. I don't know if I ever got very good at it.<br/><br/>So who are the critiquers who are going to de-stunt this community?  Who's gonna do the heavy lifting?  And will they accept their task even though they might not have much impact on the final product?<br/><br/><a href="http://critters.org" rel="nofollow">Critters.org,</a> a genre critique trading site that's been around for a decade, solved this problem by requiring critique recipients to provide critique of their own.  If you didn't pony up enough crit to stay qualified, your stories were out of the queue.  Perhaps that model might work here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128826/#Comment_128826" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T17:27:23+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  5:27PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ogremarco</cite>If you don't like a game at all, then say so up front, and leave it be.

The author ought to tell you what he's trying to do.  Telling him that's a bad plan doesn't help him.  Telling him how he can better achieve those goals does.  If you really hate the premise, step away from the keyboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, give it a spin.  If you can't figure out how to play it, that's critical information for the author.  If you can figure out how to play it and doing so doesn't deliver the goods, then how and why are going to be valuable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, even if you don't want to play it or hate the premise, everyone can use some help with editing and aesthetics.  If all you have to say is, "I think a better font for this would be Comic Sans", that's better than just shitting on the premise.  By a long shot.  Please consider "Comic Sans" a placeholder for a real font though.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I'll say that if you dig the premise and tried to play it, I don't care how mean you are when you tell me what's broken.  But the objectives going in are the sole property of the author.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is pretty close to what we used to use as guidelines for our creative writing groups.  The criticism could be pretty brutal at times, especially being face-to-face, but it was directed at solving the author's problems as he perceived them rather than inventing new ones for him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128856/#Comment_128856" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T18:24:09+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  6:24PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>"I think a better font for this would be Comic Sans",</blockquote>\nComic Sans is <em>never</em> the better font, though. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128857/#Comment_128857" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T18:26:35+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  6:26PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 6:28PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm being too subtle in some of my points, so to be explicit:<br>There is a big difference between critiquing/criticizing a <i>game</i> and critiquing/criticizing a <i>book</i>.

Sure, you can probably get great feedback that way ... but the whole reason I am here on the Internet asking people for help is because I don't have a close circle of interested friends with the time to help me. Heck it takes three weeks just to get 4 people in the same room to play a game, and that's when I'm providing the venue and the game. And I'm sure I am not alone in wanting to design a game but not having a close network of story gaming friends able to help me at a moment's notice. If I come to my favourite forum and ask for help in public you can probably assume that I need it, and want it, and can't get the other sort of help.<br><br>I also love the idea that all criticism should come out of actual play experiences. Indeed getting people who are *not you* to play your game and see how it goes, without your coaching, or preconceptions, is one of the main reasons for putting a draft or ashcan out there and asking for help. However my experience is that actually getting anyone to play your game is really hard, especially if you don't have a track record. Everyone out there has a big stack of games they really mean to get around to playing, and sure they might put your design on the list, but the chances that they will get round to playing it, or actually get back to you before you gave up on the project or published it, is small. So while I'd prefer people's comments to come from actual play, I'd rather they gave me their informed opinion based on just reading it, than no opinion at all.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128951/#Comment_128951" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T02:33:03+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  2:33AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what strikes me as odd about this thread?

Feedback is a far less confrontational term than criticism. One of the reasonings given by the tutor, apart from the academic reasons, was that people see the word 'critic-' and it preloads a huge amount of preconceived notions of what is to come. We see professional critics as either bile-filled agitators drawing blood for the baying masses or fawning sychophants bowing before the latest artistic deity-in-the-making. Feedback doesn't quite have that history.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other three concepts that I remember (in that this was done ages ago) were that all feedback had to be OWNED by you (i.e. 'I believe that DitV is...' rather than 'Everyone thinks that DitV is ...') and it has to be directed at the issue rather than the person (i.e. 'The fonts used in Cold City really make it hard ...' rather than 'Malcolm really dropped the ball with the Cold City fonts because...') and you should never present absolutes (i.e. 'I haven't been able to get to grips with Agon's resolution system' instead of 'Agon's resolution system sucks. Its bad.')<br/>\n<br/>\nRecognising that the time, effort, time, expense, time, pride and time that people have invested in these endeavours might make them just a little bit possessive about their creations and treating your comments with the care that this realisation should hopefully create an atmosphere where people feel safe to give and receive feedback on their game without the added barbs and spikes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on that bombshell..<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128956/#Comment_128956" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T02:51:46+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  2:51AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jack Aidley</cite>You know what strikes me as odd about this thread?

The author ought to tell you what he's trying to do.  Telling him that's a bad plan doesn't help him.  Telling him how he can better achieve those goals does.  If you really hate the premise, step away from the keyboard.</blockquote>The author also ought to tell what kind of feedback he expects If he does, try to respect that, barring outstanding issues. Is he working on the core concept, or on the presentation structure, the rules? Then layout or spelling or font suggestions probably are inadequate and a waste of time.<br/><br/>Similarly, it may be very useful to the author if you delimit the area of your feedback: what you did consider/try and what you did not.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: orklord</cite>Honestly, if you make a habit of offering criticism by starting a statement all nicey nice, then I will be waiting for the giant "BUT" where you get to your "real" point.  And that sure does make the nicey nice a waste of words, doesn't it?<br/><br/>If you feel you must share a critique, then offer it and be done with it.</blockquote>A good critique also points the good parts of a work. It is very important, and for more reasons than to cushion the author\u2019s ego. (As such, maybe that, as other already wrote, feedback is a better word, because it is less burdened with negative associations.) It let the author know what is appreciated, what are the strengths of his work and what should not be changed or not changed without caution. It also provides balance to negative critiques (eg if one vocal critic dislike one particular point most people find good).<br/><br/><br/>Also, try to avoid pet issues and hot buttons (yours and the autor\u2019s). Or, at the least, signal them as so.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>(Note that "destructive" needn't mean "aggressive". If I say "I don't like the layout" or "The character creation is too complicated", that's destructive but not unpleasant).<br/><br/>When people offer me destructive criticism, they give me a problem I can fix ("Fix the layout, Graham"). When people give me constructive criticism ("I think you should consider left-aligning the text and using more art"), I have to unpick everything they say: "Whoah! Why do you think that? Tell me what you didn't like, so I can fix it."</blockquote>When you say \u201cI don\u2019t like the layout\u201d, you present the author with the exact same problem: why don\u2019t you like it? Good \u201cdestructive\u201d feedback does, as good \u201cconstructive\u201d feedback\u201d, explains exactly what the (perceived) problem is (eg \u201cI don\u2019t like your layout because I have difficulties to read the text / I think your text will be hidden by the binding / I hate MS Comic Sans\u201d). Of course, sometimes you just have to say that you see a problem but can\u2019t find the actual cause.<br/><br/>Sometimes, feedback that offers no solution will be preferred by the author, as suggestions will tie him (at least momentarily) to a subset of solutions and might not be in the spirit of the work. [Side note: It is difficult for an author to communicate each \u201chidden\u201d constraint that drove his work, and difficult for a reviewer to discover them. These hidden constraints might be legitimate (objective, or arbitrary design decision) or illegitimate (evolution accidents, vestigial organs, unconscious decisions that mar the work).]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129033/#Comment_129033" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T08:22:09+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  8:22AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an outsider, I think the major thing I've picked up from Story-Games is people come here for different reasons.

Maybe the solution to this problem is that people should study and follow the Evil Hat model.

So people who wanted either or both would show up.  So wet-behind-the-ears newbies showed up for feedback and maybe some theory.  The guys with a little experience showed up for the theory discussions.  Participating in either feedback or theory tended to generate both theory and feedback.  So the Forge was meeting the needs of two demographics simply by bringing them together in the same place.<br/><br/>With the close of the Theory boards and the declaration that the Big Model was more-or-less finalized, the group of people who wanted theory discussion but did not need feedback <em>from the Forge</em> stopped showing up at the Forge.  They may have gotten feedback from elsewhere, including networks of fellow designers who they had met at the Forge initially but no longer communicated with through the Forge.  With those voices gone, the Forge is only attracting people who want feedback and don't know where else to get it -- which is not, generally speaking, experienced designers.<br/><br/>(Yes yes, I know the closing of the Theory board was not supposed to end Theory discussions, and the AP and Playtesting boards are supposed to be doing that, now with the added bonus of actually basing conclusions on empirical data, but the fact of the matter is that the barrier to talking theory was raised significantly, and therefore people stopped showing up to do it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129206/#Comment_129206" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T11:47:25+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 11:47AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's an accurate summary from my perspective of a long time Forge Poster who still prowls there, Josh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129227/#Comment_129227" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T12:17:49+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 12:17PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...

Or, rather, nothing.<br>\n<br>\n<br/>\nGoing back to the start of the thread... let me be as gentle as possible here. <br/>\n<br/>\nFUCK THE LOVE. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust give me the criticism. Love won't make my game better. I don't know why it is that we feel we have to coddle each other. Criticism given in an honest way, no matter how harsh, or even incorrect, is always beneficial. You should take it for what it is, criticism of the game you have. Not as a personal attack. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you can't handle criticism that way, then, frankly, you don't deserve any. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I ask for criticism in public, then feel free to give it to me in public, no matter how humiliating you think it might be. Give unsolicited criticism privately, yes. Or, if you don't want the criticism to be seen publicly, ask for it privately. But don't go on a forum, ask for criticism, and then take it with anything less that all the equanimity you can muster. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's really not that hard. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been dreading doing something that I think needs to be done, and that's to start a thread in which I, unsolicitedly, and others, criticize every game known to man to the core of it's being. The reason I dread it is not that I worry about how people will take it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm just lazy, and don't want to do it. I mean what's the use of unsolicited criticism... it'll almost certainly amount to nothing. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I'm afraid I'm gonna have to. Y'all have forced my hand. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129266/#Comment_129266" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T13:07:58+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:07PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, I'm making buttons and teeshirts that read "FUCK THE LOVE," now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129285/#Comment_129285" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T13:30:25+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  1:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I side with the "pure criticism, no love".

An all-negative critique is only marginally more useful than an all-positive one.<br/><br/>I also believe that even the most negative of critiques can be informed by love.  I've seen critiquers who are teachers, and critiquers who are ranters.  The big difference between them was that the teachers were very strategic about their tone.  My own experience teaching English and critiquing fiction have made me believe that bluntness isn't optimal in every circumstance.  Here's something I once wrote on my LJ:\n<blockquote>Sugar-coating is a very useful technique, because if someone's defenses are up in anticipation of a painful experience, they are less likely to absorb anything. If they're not absorbing anything, then what's the point of critiquing at all? The more passionate the critique makes you feel, the more smoothly you should attempt to deliver it.  Why increase the chance that you're wasting your time?</blockquote>\nLovefuckers like Mike or Tristan reject sugarcoating, and that's cool, but other folks are optimally served by a different approach.  I say that if you want your criticism to be most useful, you will calibrate your response to your critiquee's needs, and not to your own.  <br/><br/>Yeah, I feel strongly about this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129320/#Comment_129320" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T14:06:39+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  2:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bonobo Roby</cite>Dude, I'm making buttons and teeshirts that read "FUCK THE LOVE," now.</blockquote>\nSure you are.

Here's why.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, when people rant at me, I'm largely inclined to rant back.  While I've gotten better at this in my old age and now try to do more walking away, either way no communication happened...critique useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, while there is sometimes value in stinging someone's pride or taking the piss out of them (sometimes that's the only way to get a person's attention), critiquing an RPG isn't such a situation.  We all have things that we are proud of, and to have someone stomp on that stings.  I don't care how thick skinned you think you are, it stings.  Now the stinging isn't fatal...but its also not useful.  Since there's no utility to it, there no point in doing it.  Stinging someone's pride in the context of an RPG review is about kicking them where they're weak, and a good critique should be all about building them up where they're weak (the philosophy behind my "say no negative thing without a suggestion to make it better" rule from previous).<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, I think the format for criticism that I find most valuable (and I'll point to Thor/Luke and Ryan/Paul as testimonial examples) is partnership.  And here I don't JUST mean formal working relationships like these, but even unsolicited game reviews can be done in the spirit of partnering with the designer to make the game better...even if you've never even met the designer.<br/>\n<br/>\nMY goal is to design, produce, and release a great game.<br/>\n<br/>\nShow me first that YOUR goal is for me to design, produce and release a great game...THEN hit me with the critique.  That makes us allies.  That means I'm not defending myself from an asshole, but defending my design choices from honest suggestions that they were suboptimal.  That means that acknowledging the criticism is not a matter of conceding defeat to an asshole, but rather taking the first step to make things better jointly with a partner who's also committed to making things better.  EDITED to note that I think the above is precisely the philosophy behind Ashcan Front which pisses me off that I havent' participated in it more fully.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, defending my choices from someone who wants my game to be bad...or doesn't really care about it, is pointless.  Who knows what motivated them to say those things.  But if someone wants my game to be good, I should be able to defend my choices in a way that satisfies them...or else I have to consider that maybe they really weren't good choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if the design is already released, same thing.  I haven't counted, but I bet the games that are still selling that haven't been revised are outnumbered by the games that have.  So maybe its too late to salvage this print run (unless you're using Lulu or a PDF), but lets partner up to make the next one better.  And if not the next version of this game (because maybe sales don't justify it) then the lessons I can learn here can make the next one better.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for me to take anything you say seriously and really think long and hard about whether maybe you've got a point that I should look to address...you first have to demonstrate to me that we're on the same page, that we both have the same goal of making the game better than it was...together.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd THAT is much more easily done in the spirit of partnership than Fuck the Love IMO                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129365/#Comment_129365" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T14:58:38+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  2:58PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sorry.

The stuff I've learned here has even made my traditional RPG gaming way more fun.  Even GURPS -- awful, stodgy, Harrison Bergeronesque GURPS -- is better for me in 2008 than it was in 1998.  Flawless Victory!  I think a lot of people who hang out round these parts can take a bow for that.  Thanks, people.<br/><br/>Yeah, there's a bit of a Baron Munchausen vibe here.  But I think the will to awesome is driven by honest enthusiasm for the people and the games in this space.  So much of the Internet is given over to catpiss men and snarkers.  For me, this place is Winston Smith's Golden Country.  It is the blue sky from the end of Brazil.<br/><br/>Mind you, I just play games, I don't design them or podcast about them or whatever.  So, lemme ask -- the need to adjust the tone of the community, is that a designer impulse?  Is the community not serving game designers or is it not serving game players?  Or is it not serving all of us?  Are there any people here who just play games and feel that things are broken?<br/><br/>(aside: I would love to do a census post where we find out how many story-games people are game designers, how many are game publishers, how many have game publications like a mag or a podcast, how many organize cons, and how many just play.  has such a thing been done yet?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129461/#Comment_129461" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T16:58:26+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  4:58PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>As a quick aside, I'd like to point out that the value of cricisim of Game X goes way beyond the potential for improving Game X.  You do not need to criticise it before it's public release to be useful.  Because your productive criticisms of Gamee X might have a useful impact on Game Y, which may or may not be produced by the same designer as Game X.</p>\n<p>For a personal example or three, I read many reviews of many games while I was designing <em>the Infected</em>.  Many of them informed how I designed and wrote the thing.  Hopefully some of those reviews I read helped improve what I created.  If you were to find something screwed up about my game that I didn't already know was screwed up and pointed it out to me, that would certainly help me design my next project better.  And, finally, some of the really good criticism I received while creating that game did not go into the final product.  Not because I didn't want to make it better, but rather because I wasn't able to figure out how to impliment that criticism into my design work.  But that feedback is still with me, informing my new designs.</p>\n<p>I think post-publication feedback may even be more valuable than pre-publication feedback.

In fact, I think that, given the changes that I'd like to see, "adjusting the tone of the community" is about the worst way to make those happen.  So it's not an impulse at all, designer <em>or</em> player.<br/><br/>I think this community serves some players, and some designers -- and I think the criteria for who is in and out of that 'some' can be less than pretty when you examine them.  I can't fix that, though.  That's a cultural groupthink mish-mash thing that's beyond any one person's control.  The only thing I can do is participate in this community with honesty and integrity, which is what I'm trying to do.  A few other people are doing the same.<br/><br/>And if a handful of people starting to act with honesty and integrity looks like a conspiracy to subvert the community, it makes you question how that community operates.<br/><br/><strong>Edit:</strong> Eric, thanks for highlighting that; it's a big piece that we haven't really touched on!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129501/#Comment_129501" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T17:56:39+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  5:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 5:57PM by John_Harper.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bonobo Roby</cite>The only thing I can do is participate in this community with honesty and integrity, which is what I'm trying to do.
