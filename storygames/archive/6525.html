I think the fee was $50.  Incorporation is waaaaay too much hassle for what we (and I assume most of us here) do.  We run it as sole proprietorship in my name; that works because Lisa was not "materially involved" according to IRS standards.  She also has her own crafting business.  So I filed a Schedule C for each of us this year, attached to our standard 1040.  We didn't need to file for social security taxes because neither of us had a net profit of $400 or over, but we paid extra income tax on about $500 combined.<br/><br/>My tax filing was accepted and my refund deposited earlier this week, so if you need any specific advice on how to fill out those suckers, let me know. It seems to have worked the way I did it (disclaimer: not a professional tax accountant here <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.  I didn't even try to get credits for home or vehicle use and all that stuff, though; that's very little benefit for a lot of hassle and more potential for an audit.<br/><br/>Oh, and Oregon doesn't have a sales tax, so I didn't need to worry about that part. People in other states might.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144670/#Comment_144670" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T12:27:17+00:00" title="May 17, 2008 12:27PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2008 12:27PM by Kynn.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>First off, since you asked: the Forge is probably a better place for this sort of stuff.</blockquote>\n*wince*<br/><br/>Anywhere <i>besides</i> the Forge?

For a small business, this is usually only necessary in two cases:<br/>\n1) Service industry - Any time where you handle property that is not yours, you want to be incorporated if your business model can support the extra expense. If someone sues you for deleting business data off of their PC while you are working on it or bleaching a priceless heirloom, it pays for itself...<br/>\n2) Potentially contentious Trademarks - In other words if you make a signature character for your RPG called Mikey Mouse, then you might need to incorporate if you won't cease and desist when Disney gets wind of it...<br/>\n<br/>\n  Barring those two contingencies, DBA and a business license is a good way to go. Typically, in the beginning of the RPG publishing process you can write off expenses for supplies and if you start to make money, it simplifies the amount of paperwork you will face.<br/>\n  If I remember correctly for a non-successful business or a mildly successful business DBA/business License is more beneficial from a tax perspective. But, if your business is successful, any corporate formation is more advantageous from a tax perspective (lower tax brackets).<br/>\n  That's pretty much all I know, but if you want me to clarify anything I said, let me know.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144986/#Comment_144986" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T18:25:53+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  6:25PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, just for the record:<br/><br/>My question wasn't all that clear.

I would do what these guys suggest and look at the Forge forums for discussions on these.  That should hopefully eliminate many of the grey areas, or at least pair down the list to "Okay, that sounds about right" and "Well, I definitely don't need <i>that</i>."<br/><br/>But my fiance is in the midst of starting up her own business, and I can assure you, you will do nothing but good things for yourself by finding some small business workshops in your area.  San Jose has some regular ones, for a small fee (like $70), former CEO's and other executives (retired, mostly from small business, but some from larger corporations) volunteer and give back to the community by running workshops for people looking to start up their own business.  You should be able to get a run down of these various options, the advantages and disadvantages of each, likely also tax and legal advice, and common pitfalls to avoid, and everything you need to know to do the paperwork for whatever you choose.<br/><br/>But that might be overkill if you're just looking to publish a single book or two.
