To the point that you had an easier time getting how a game worked by either playing with people who knew the game, watching a video or reading an AP.<br/><br/>Then I read Archipelago, PbtA games, Witch Mountain, etc. and finally got a more clear vision, which took me to start <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18646/techniques-do-we-have-a-list-of-them/p1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> on 2013 and later to post a compilation of the results <a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/techniques/" rel="nofollow">here</a><br/><br/>A couple other things lately got me into the idea that while I had listed a good amount of techniques, I hadn't put them in order nor classified them. Turns out that putting them on the order we use them in the conversation at the table makes for a really good description of how an RPG actually works. So I spent the past week compiling a proper list, until this <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/467117/#Comment_467117" rel="nofollow">small derrail at this thread</a> brought something else to my attention. But let's go over the list first: <br/><br/><br/>Here's the actual list I personally use along with some caveats and subtleties for each one:\n<blockquote><br/><b>You are all in ... </b> The Narrator begins the conversation by describing the place, who is present and what is happening. Pictures, music and sounds are also welcomed for this task, as well as using gestures, body language and your own sight's direction and focus to help players picture size, speed and mood of whatever you're describing. You can do it in many ways, but you should always focus on what the PCs can perceive from their points of view while considering all the senses that can give them relevant information. Doubles as a pacing mechanism as the Narrator can even advance time and jump to any place, or interrupt a conversation that is distracting the players by using it.<br/><br/><b>What do you do?</b> The Narrator will use this question to signal players that her description is over and ask for their input. Players take turns to do so or talk with a Caller that then will explain the feedback of the whole group to the Narrator. Players must make sure that everyone gets an opportunity to answer before moving on to another round of the game. The Narrator can address this question to either the group or an specific player as required by the fiction.<br/><br/><b>Can I do X?</b> Before deciding to take an action players can ask if it is possible and get some clues about the difficulty or consequences. The narrator answers by confirming or adding details. IMPORTANT: The character can only react based on what he knows as a character, not what the player knows. If the player knows that there is a monster but his character does not, he can not act as if he suspected or knew.<br/><br/><b>Yes, but Y could happen</b> The usual answer to the previous question, also know as setting the stakes. Sometimes risks are not clear or get misheard/misinterpreted from the narrator's description. Setting the stakes is an important stage to make player's decisions matter. If possible the narrator should explain the risks and consequences even if no one asks.<br/><br/><b>Is there Z there?</b> Players can use this question to suggest and / or verify the existence of something or someone not explicitly described by the narrator, but whose existence makes sense. If the narrator describes that PCs are in a smithy, anyone can assume that there is a hammer around and ask to confirm it. The narrator can then either confirm or deny it, though only with a plausible excuse.<br/><br/><b>What do you think?</b> Sometimes the Narrator does not have all the answers, just when players seem to be asking something related to their own expectations. The narrator can always return the question to the player so that a clearer or fresh idea about what he hopes to find in fiction. In any case with this question the Storyteller can always decide if he takes and uses the player's response as it is or if he can improve it or simply discard and move on.<br/><br/><b>What you see is ...</b> This sentence serves two functions. On the one hand, when the previous question is used, it is sometimes necessary to edit the contributions of the players to adapt those to what has already been established in the game. If the setting is medieval historic and someone introduces Mickey Mouse as a character, the Narrator can edit the character to be the mouse pet of another character, that has decided to call it Mickey and the mouse does not speak nor is it different from a real mouse.<br/><br/><b>I go there. What do I see? What other things / people are there?</b> Players can ask for further information about their environment whenever they feel necessary, keeping in mind the limitation of the viewpoint and senses of the characters. Seeing a battlefield from above isn't the same than trying to understand what's going on while you're in the middle of it.<br/><br/><b>Come on!</b> Both the narrator and the players may not like something, either because the description is very graphic, touches an unpleasant subject or does it in an uncomfortable or even unsafe way. Whatever the case everyone at the table can use this phrase to ask for changes, quickly end a scene or even take a break to discuss it, if it's necessary. The game is supposed to be fun for everyone and although a little tolerance helps, no one has to put up with something that will ruin their whole experience.<br/><br/><b>I will do X </b> Once the player believes he has enough information he must decide what his character will do. Even if you just want to wait and observe the events, you should also let the group know.<br/><br/><b>Ok, how do you do it? / why? </b> The Narrator uses this questions to get enough player input on how actions will be performed and/or their intent, to determine whether a dice roll is necessary or not, whether there are circumstances that alter the difficulty of the roll and finally to narrate how the world changes correctly according to what the players said.<br/><br/><b>Does your character has / knows how to use / knows about N? </b>- Sometimes the Storyteller will need to confirm if a character has an item, skill or knowledge that allows him to overcome a challenge or reduce his difficulty. Usually the response will be on the player's tab, but this could also be argued using any other circumstances that help. The narrator will be the one who finally decides their validity and relevance.<br/><br/><b>Roll the dice!</b> Once the Narrator has determined if there is a challenge, what is it and its difficulty, she will ask the player to roll the dice to see what happens. This is where the conflict resolution mechanic will be executed beyond the point of no return.<br/><br/><b>What happens is that...</b> when the result of the roll is known, the Storyteller describes what happens in the fiction as a result. If it affects another player character, the narration goes there immediately. When each player has participated at least once performing an action, it is time to pass to the next round of the game. The conversational cycle starts over or jumps from one point to another when necessary.<br/></blockquote>\nNow, my whole idea for my game was to make a hardcoded procedure that uses the ritual phrases listed above, to explain better how the game goes. I'll probably add some moves over it, as I finally got from the other thread another insight about how to use them better; but for now my main concern was this list of phrases, so I'd like to know if any of these look or feel totally unfamiliar (there might be a language barrier here as english is my second language) and if you use them differently, what kind of changes you apply on them, which of them you hate and why they don't work for you. Anything helps! thanks for your time!                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467156/#Comment_467156" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-21T10:44:44+00:00" title="October 21, 2017 10:44AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">@rgrassi</a> uses a similar approach to writing his games.<br/>His "generic rpg" <b>Levity</b> is actually less of a rulebook and more of a treaties and analysis about which techniques are used in rpgs and how they could fit together to produce different play experiences.<br/>You two should talk <img alt=":mrgreen:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/mrgreen.png" title=":mrgreen:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467180/#Comment_467180" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-23T12:35:04+00:00" title="October 23, 2017 12:35PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2017 1:23PM by rgrassi.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks <a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a> .<br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> , here you find the framework to which Hasimir refers.<br/><a href="http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/?p=252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.levity-rpg.net/en/?p=252</a><br/>Your techniques may be "generally extended" into a more generic framework.<br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467191/#Comment_467191" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-23T19:47:58+00:00" title="October 23, 2017  7:47PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just reading Levity IV now Rob, nice work!.

I'd like to see if there are further reasons for these particular choices, like what happens with you or your group if you use one or the other?<br/><br/>For example, in our case -and perhaps this is the language barrier mucking my intention- We use something along the lines of "Can I do X?", like "Can I sneak behind this area and surprise the guard from the back?", where "do" is replaced by the proper verb related to the action. It's a bit more colloquial for us in spanish. I get the idea behind "I try to judge if..." though, to have a clean actual ritual phrase, free of cheap algebraic variables to muddle them. Perhaps I should rephrase the explanation or not use the term "ritual phrases" for them?<br/><br/>"Is there Z there?" is used along "I look for...", though this last one is used less. Actually this one we should try to use more, as it's phrased a bit more from the character point of view. However at least in spanish, asking "is there a hammer in the forge?" feels just a tad different. The former implies that the character is searching, even if it's weaker than "I search for a hammer in the forge". Players won't use anything that could imply "search" as that is perceived as an action, which would make their characters waste additional fiction time. <br/><br/>Asking instead "is there a hammer in the forge?" (again, in spanish, not sure if it feels the same in english) implies that the answer will depend on something already in the knowledge of the character, like asking "Did I saw a hammer when I came into the room?". Perhaps I should change the ritual phrase to "Did I saw a..." ? Does the difference matters too much in english?<br/><br/>Agreed about the "why?", I'll edit the first post later. Mi initial idea for putting the two together was more about the Narrator usually asking any or both of those questions in the same moment at the conversation, as intent can sometimes influence how believable or how difficult is an action for a character, as means do. But the reasons for asking any of those fall wide apart anyway.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467196/#Comment_467196" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-23T22:59:18+00:00" title="October 23, 2017 10:59PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe that either "Come on!" or "Objection!" could work with <i>the smile</i>.

By asking, the player is asserting that Z <i>is there</i>. The GM must then prove that it isn't, or accept that it is. Presumably, if the GM says no, then the player might further negotiate the position. "No hammer? How does the blacksmith do their work?" If the GM doubles down and insists there is no hammer there, then a hammer not being there has now become <i>Important</i>.<br/><br/>I think establishing Importance is a signaling game players and GMs do all the time. Without coming right out and saying it, players ask probing questions to determine what is important and what is not. GMs toy with players a bit to misdirect or create paranoia, by giving information that seems like clues because it plays with that signaling behavior. Like rolling dice for no reason, or describing the details on the floor.<br/><br/>Of course, <b>Does your character has / knows how to use / knows about N?</b> and <b>Ok, how do you do it? / why?</b> are similar tools for the GM to challenge the player to prove their side of things. I'd argue that <b>how do you do it?</b> is fundamentally different than <b>why do you do it?</b>; the former establishes fictional positioning whereas the latter establishes player motive (or perhaps character motive, but that matters less).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467212/#Comment_467212" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-24T20:10:49+00:00" title="October 24, 2017  8:10PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2017 8:11PM by WarriorMonk.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, certainly!

I mean, it's not entirely as if everything here is totally new, but noticing these subtleties really makes a difference! Just edited some of the phrases and added a couple more, the new versions would look like:\n<blockquote><br/><b>Can I do X?</b> (also used as <b>I try to judge if...</b>)Before deciding to take an action players can ask if it is possible and get some clues about the difficulty or consequences. The narrator answers by confirming or adding details. IMPORTANT: The character can only react based on what he knows as a character, not what the player knows. If the player knows that there is a monster but his character does not, he can not act as if he suspected or knew.<br/><br/><b>Is there Z there?</b>or <b>Do I see Z?</b> Players can use this question to suggest and / or verify the existence of something or someone not explicitly described by the narrator, but whose existence makes sense. If the narrator describes that PCs are in a smithy, anyone can assume that there is a hammer around and ask to confirm it. The narrator can then either confirm or deny it, though only with a plausible excuse. If there's no such excuse, the absence of the object becomes important in the scene as a clue for further situation development in the fiction.<br/><br/>in a similar fashion, questions like <b>How about...?</b> - <b>Wouldn't be lucky...?</b> or <b>wouldn't make sense...?</b> can be used by the players to give the Narrator suggestions of not only objects and characters in the scene but whole turns of events that could happen given the current circumstances. The Narrator would still be free to take those suggestions, edit, improve and make them happen whenever she wants. Making them happen in the spot may look as if the player just read the Narrator's mind, while using other event as misdirection before introducing the player's suggestion accomplishes a similar surprise effect.<br/><br/><b>Come on!</b> or <b>Objection! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(ALWAYS said with a smile!)</span></b> Both the narrator and the players may not like something, either because the description breaks their immersion, is too graphic, touches an unpleasant subject or does it in an uncomfortable or even unsafe way. Whatever the case everyone at the table can use this phrase to ask for changes, quickly end a scene or even take a break to discuss it, if it's necessary. The game is supposed to be fun for everyone and although a little tolerance helps, no one has to put up with something that will ruin their whole experience. <br/><br/>However it's of the same importance to express this discomfort as calmly and in good humour as possible. Normally no player will purposely include such content knowing it could hurt the sensibility of other player at the table, they would usually just assume everyone at the table shares her own tastes and/or tolerance for the subject and won't know they are at fault until somebody else reacts. So basically, both players need to measure themselves.<br/><br/><b>Ok, how do you do it? </b> The Narrator uses this question to get enough player input on how actions will be performed, to determine whether a dice roll is necessary or not, whether there are circumstances that alter the difficulty of the roll and finally to narrate how the world changes correctly according to what the players said. "I attack" doesn't give enough information to the Narrator about what kind of things could happen, even if the roll for the attack is a critical. And while everything can be narrated based on the roll, what happens then is that the roll is actually robbing the player a lot of the meaning of her decision.<br/><br/><b>why would you do that?</b> Sometimes the intent and motivations behind the player's actions aren't clear for the narrator, and may seem to be totally out of character -thus breaking the Narrator and other player's immersion. It could be just a misunderstanding though. This question gives the player a chance to either rethink their actions, justify them or at least try to come up with a plausible excuse. Failing to provide a proper answer may lead the Narrator and other players to offer proper suggestions for a better motivation, a similar action more in line with the character concept and drives, or a different, more plausible reaction for the character. Or the use of the phrase <i>Come on!</i> as seen above.<br/><br/><b>Does your character has / knows how to use / knows about N? </b>- Sometimes the Storyteller will need to confirm if a character has an item, skill or knowledge that allows him to overcome a challenge or reduce his difficulty. Usually the response will be on the character's sheet, but this could also be argued using any other circumstances already established in the fiction that could help. The narrator will be the one who finally decides their validity and relevance.<br/></blockquote>\nAlso, while lurking at the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21314/fictional-causality-vs-resolving-ambiguity#latest" rel="nofollow">fictional causality vs resolving ambiguity thread</a> I thought of this phrase I use on those cases. It's more of a crude fix than a proper technique, though. Eventually I'll have to make a list of these fixing phrases too:\n<blockquote> <br/><b>What?</b> a description, character reaction or mood can totally fail to make sense for the players, or just confuse them  -though not to the point to trigger a <i>Come on!</i>. When hearing this question the Narrator should try to rephrase or briefly explain what\u2019s actually going on, even if this means -in an extreme case- revealing to the players information that their characters don\u2019t know. In such case, it\u2019s also good to remind them that their characters can\u2019t act on such information. <br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467231/#Comment_467231" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-25T15:51:12+00:00" title="October 25, 2017  3:51PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is really a deep dive into "how do you actually play a role-playing game."

The statement is stored in a sort of "stage area" waiting to be "processed". This is what Levity calls "Narration Power". (each rpg configures Narration Powers by the players in different ways).<br/>After this step two other steps must occur (and each rpg system also defines them in different ways):<br/>- Opposition Power (someone has the rights to oppose the fictional statement in some way).<br/>- Decision Power (someone has the rights to determine how to solve the stale, i.e. rolling dice, by authority, etc...)<br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467233/#Comment_467233" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-25T16:25:25+00:00" title="October 25, 2017  4:25PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a>, Exactly! We are all sure that we know how to roleplay, but I believe that among other stuff, how we say things at the table (and as you can see, it's mostly the same things) is a big deal of why we enjoy one game/system more than others. Most probably each game needs particular adjustments to the conversation as well as the mindset behind it for the players to achieve Flow and enjoy the game at it's fullest potential. However we keep making the mistake (or sometimes, the discovery) of porting techniques from other games without thinking how they could affect the system<br/><br/>Rob, perhaps what is missing there is the assumption that there's a Narrator. I mean, a Narrator's "saying" has more weight as a statement, it's as if the players can just skip confirmation since his "Narration Power" is a given. That doesn't deny them of the right of negotiating the fiction. It's not as if the step isn't there, but just skipped because the social contract has established so -though this is only applied to GM games, and mostly on trads at this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467234/#Comment_467234" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-25T16:28:05+00:00" title="October 25, 2017  4:28PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But perhaps I'm still missing something important there.

So far in this particular design:\n<blockquote><br/>-Game fiction statements are immediately distinguished form other types by the opening phrase used to expose them to the other players. These phrases will resemble the ones listed above.<br/><br/>-The Narrator is held responsible of limiting the boundaries of the fiction, applying her own parameters of what is plausible and/or nice. However, players can negotiate and make suggestions by using the phrases listed above.<br/><br/>-It's important that most of those suggestions are phrased as questions by the players, since it's thanks to recognition of the Narrator's authority that a good deal of the negotiation can be skipped. Whenever a player makes an statement clearly outside the bounds of her character expressing it as a fact instead of a question, the Narrator's authority is damaged. A good degree of trust and knowing the Narrator enough to suggest only things that appeal to her parameters of what's plausible and/or nice may suffice to dispense of this though. And statements entirely in the scope of their own character are exempt of this practice, of course.<br/><br/>-If a Narrator is asked for validation for their choices and can't present a proper argument the. It's then quickly consulted to the group (Hmmm, this would need it's own ritual phrase, I believe) to either confirm or deny it. It's the same case when a player's argument for their choices is the one that doesn't seem to be neither plausible, congruent or nice.<br/><br/>-For the Essences, the players have to decide ans clearly express what they want to happen in the fiction, however limitations apply here: For things outside the scope of their characters, they have to express them as questions. For things that are inside the scope of their characters, they can just make statements. <br/><br/>Also, this design accepts the fact that not every player is always aware of their game expectations, nor is always even able to express them on time, nor accurately. So it's part of the Narrator's responsibilities to check each player's character sheet, ask them questions about their particular choices, and use those answers to build the setting and push foward the fiction.<br/><br/>-Power of narration is usually divided between the narrator -whose scope is the NPCs and the world around the characters, and the players -whose scope is limited to their own characters. In cases where a PC isn't present at the scene, the Narrator could assign it's player a limited scope of the fiction in the form or an NPC, a monster, etc. It may also fall in territory of randomization under the form of reading the dice or using random tables.<br/><br/>-Power of opposition is dynamically divided between the players and the narrator. If it's the players against the environment, the Narrator will have opposing rights; if it's PvP then involved players will have opposing rights. Sometimes the player will be able to roleplay her way around a conflict; this isn't only expected but recommended.<br/><br/>-Power of resolution is handled by the dice whenever negotiation reaches a wall- which usually means two arguments and at least one quick poll, tops. Either the Narrator or the players are free to call for the dice roll. Though, for in-fiction opposition at least, the players roll to not fail and the Narrator defines a difficulty number, that can be negotiated up or down depending on the player's actions and world variables.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI think that's basically it?

I'ts not meant to be generic, as it's obvious it's missing many other techniques that are crucial for other types of gameplay. I'm not offering here a general solution I think everyone should use. <br/><br/>That's why I often wrote things like "in m design", meaning "this is the particular way I'm doing things, you may have yours, I'm not trying to tell you how things should be done"<br/><br/>I recall that some people on the forum have reacted to my opinions in a similar way before. Others have expressed themselves carelessly about how they do things, and reading them one may think "why do this person thinks this is the way everyone should be doing things? and why being so arrogant to not even admit other people may do things differently?". This is why I think the language barrier (or maybe other things) prevents people from noticing subtleties even in what we write here in SG.<br/><br/>Perhaps there's a cultural barrier too. I mean, for me is normal and respectful to say "See, here is how I do things, how do you do these same things?". My intent is to be open about the results of my research, share the information in the hope of finding others who would share their thoughts and experience. So, by all means, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong or share any personal experience that totally contradicts anything here. I'm not offended, but I just want to make clear that my intention isn't to tell everyone "how things should be done"<br/><br/>Also, somebody wrote some time ago: <i>don't ask things on the internet, post the wrong answer and everyone will correct you</i>.<br/><br/>So, moving on from what I posted, would you mind to expand a bit more on how would you tackle the subject? The theme of the thread is still about how you handle the subtleties of what's said at the table to engage in your own gameplay style, which of them do you think are really crucial and why.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467505/#Comment_467505" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-05T20:30:36+00:00" title="November  5, 2017  8:30PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, sorry.
