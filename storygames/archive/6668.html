This is my first post here, and while I've read the forum on and off since its inception, it's just possible that this is in the wrong place or I'm otherwise offensive. Let me know of any faux pas. It's within the realm of possibility that I might end up participating at the Story Games in other ways as well now that I've been granted an account here, so I guess this is also a kind of a self-introduction post as well as a call for volunteers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs some of you might know, I'm working on a new edition for The Shadow of Yesterday by Clinton R. Nixon; I have a <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/tsoy/" rel="nofollow">little page</a> set up specifically so I don't need to explain the whole story again and again; check that out to see what my project is about in specifics. The point is, I finally got around to registering here at Story Games (not something I usually do, forum writing) because there are some rather interesting Solar System actual play reports here from time to time, and I thought that it would be worthwhile to see if any folks here might be interested in helping me out in my Solar System vignette writing project.<br/>\n<br/>\nI explained the project already <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26320" rel="nofollow">at the Forge</a>, and there's also the actual coordination page I set up today <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/tsoy/solar-system-communal-vignette-writing/" rel="nofollow">at my blog</a>, so I don't really need to write the same stuff again here. The point is, there is a lot of overlap between Forge readership and here, but it'd be great if by writing here I could reach TSoY players who would otherwise miss my net at the Forge. The current project is not so much about being a great big game designer, after all, but just about having real experience playing with the Solar System - I'd love to get some gamemaster types involved, the kind who run a great game and have advice to give, even if they aren't that hot on concrete game design.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to comment on my little project even if you don't have the time or the background knowledge to participate - I'm certainly interested if there's some fatal flaw that I'm unaware of. And if sudden inspiration strikes, I don't mind it if you want to write a vignette for me right here, in whispers or via email - I'm easily reachable at eero.tuovinen[]arkkikivi.net.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147746/#Comment_147746" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T16:02:12+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  4:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 4:05PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome, Eero!

The main point is to write the actual vignette with suitable irreverence for what happened [i]really[/i]; I might perhaps try to condense my editorial priorities into three bullet-points here:\n<ul>\n<li>It's pretty much necessary that a person feels confident in the advice he gives or example he sets. That's why I don't want a person who hasn't actually played the Solar System to help me out here - whether the example he sets is good or not, he can't vouch for it on the basis of his own experience. I'm planning to publish these vignettes with attribution partially because I think that only the writer can really carry the onus of making whatever claims he might make, and then only if he actually has the experience and expertise.</li>\n<li>As regards the contents of the fiction, I'd like to get a lot of different genres and styles in the set of examples. Most of us have mostly played fantasy games with the Solar System, but nothing is preventing us from rewriting those experiences into other genres here - the fiction is present in the vignettes to demonstrate the kind of imaginative content one might create with the game, so I'm not supremely invested in whether it's invented wholesale or based on actual play. Whatever produces the most inspiring reading experience.</li>\n<li>As regards the game procedures and interaction illustrated by the vignette, I'd priorize clarity and pedagogical punch over reporting faithfully. Have the points you want to teach in mind and don't get "cute" with dialogue and such. Often play examples in rpg books spend most of their allocated space on snappy banter between players, leaving the main point vague. (My own vignette is a bit of a bad example in this regard, I guess, as it follows player dialogue faithfully. My defense is that it's supposed to illustrate how players interact at the table and how they communicate character intent in words, so it's actually on-topic in this vignette to have specific dialogue.)</li>\n</ul>\nAccording to that, it seems to me that both of your examples are just great, and I'll be glad to check out either. Don't worry about writing style so much - we can work on the style to make it fit the product, after all. Take the best and most educational parts of your actual play experience and turn them into a vignette. If you don't feel like rewriting the actual play event into some other genre, that's not a big deal at this point, either - we're going to have a fantasy-dominated set of vignettes anyway, as it's the most popular genre and the one where most Solar System play has happened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147977/#Comment_147977" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T06:49:27+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  6:49AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Eero,<br/><br/>Consider me interested in a vignette as well.

What\u2019s wrong with a team of oddball adventurers, called by destiny to save a kingdom?</i></b><br/><br/>\u201cAncient China, huh?\u201d <br/><br/>We\u2019d all agreed on the  focus of our next campaign \u2013 the long-lost kingdom of Ba, whose warriors wore vine armor and defended their mountains from powerful neighbors.  But Mike was skeptical.  \u201cIt\u2019ll be cool!\u201d we told him, \u201cwe can get crazy with Chinese mythology!  Rival kingdoms, intrigue, battles, barbarians\u2026\u201d<br/><br/>Mike shrugged.  \u201cBut who <i>are </i>we?\u201d<br/><br/>Good question.  <br/><br/>\u201cWell,\u201d Steve offered, \u201cwe could be Ba nobles.\u201d<br/><br/>Tom scowled.  \u201cOr oppressed peasants more interested in preserving our crops than fighting for another brutal hegemony.\u201d<br/><br/>Dale and Joel exchanged weary glances.  <br/><br/>The conversation went back and forth while I browsed Wikipedia.  Something in the entry on the Kingdom of Ba caught my eye.  \u201cHey guys,\u201d I said, \u201cit says here that Ba held the white tiger in mystical esteem.  What about a crazy prophecy that the \u201cfive claws of the white tiger\u201d will return and save Ba?\u201d<br/><br/>Mike\u2019s eyes lit up.  \u201cSo I could play a cowardly loser from some backwater village, called by destiny?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cYes!\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI want to be an ex-slave who can talk to his ancestors!\u201d  Joel cried.  Steve announced his intention to play an arrogant knight with Key of the Paragon.  Suddenly, everyone was on board.  <br/><br/>Since the Claws could come from any background, there was room for everyone to find a niche they loved.  There was a hook to bring them together, too.  As Story Guide, I wanted to start play with some pre-existing relationships as well.  \u201cLet\u2019s establish some backstory,\u201d I said, \u201cWho knows who?\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWhat if Steve\u2019s guy and my guy were cousins?\u201d Dale suggested.  \u201cDude, Key of Fraternity!\u201d Steve replied, and they feverishly worked up a family history.<br/>\u201cWhat about your villager, Mike?\u201d I asked.  <br/><br/>\u201cPang Shan village is in the territory ruled by those guys and their family.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cCool,\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019d be a great focus for the Key of the Clan we wrote up, too.  We\u2019ll begin play with the village about to be attacked by the infamous Gan Dang Marauders.\u201d  <br/><br/>\u201cI cannot allow that!\u201d Steve shouted.<br/><br/>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Joel said with an evil grin, \u201cbecause my character, An Gao, is one of the Marauders.\u201d<br/><br/>I rubbed my hands with glee \u2013 out of our setting, an exciting situation had emerged!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148613/#Comment_148613" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T12:22:11+00:00" title="June  6, 2008 12:22PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *I cannot allow that!*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148974/#Comment_148974" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T06:56:45+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  6:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part the first,<br/>\nExample: Using Refresh and Keys together<br/>\nLesson: There is no cheating<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, I was playing a roguish pirate in a vaguely "Pirates of the Carribean" game setting and I was doing well.

But perhaps there are some TSoY players out there I don't know about who might have some stories they want to tell?<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I can just write the rest myself, so it's not that big a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
