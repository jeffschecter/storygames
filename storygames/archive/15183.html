The money has allowed her to do and see things she never would have gotten to do and see otherwise, but of course, money is not a cure. Recently, she posted a heartbreaking note on Facebook about how she realized she can no longer see the stars at night, and how she didn't even realize that she'd lost the ability until she was actively looking for them.<br/><br/>After the shock subsided, I got to thinking about vision impairment and games\u2014 there are plenty of traditional boardgames that have been modified into braille versions, and a few art games made to show sighted people what it's like to be blind. But the more I thought about it, the more perfect tabletop RPGs seemed to be for the vision impaired; it's easy to get dice with raised or recessed numbers or pips, and you don't miss a second of the action by not being able to see what's going on. <br/><br/>Which made me wonder: how many of you have gamed with (or are) blind or vision-impaired gamers? How are character sheets handled? Is there anything we as publishers can do to make our PDFs more accessible? I imagine braille transcription and printing is pretty pricey.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345031/#Comment_345031" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T10:55:06+00:00" title="October  6, 2011 10:55AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>Which made me wonder: how many of you have gamed with (or are) blind or vision-impaired gamers?</blockquote>\nWould you count in dyslexia?

As long as the PDF isn't cluttered it should read the text fine. I haven't confirmed on the one vs two column thing ala Ryan's post above, but readers should recognize this straight up.<br/><br/>Not sure about how indexing would help/hurt readers: Does it make it more accessible, or does it really not do anything because of the manipulation involved to get to the index?<br/><br/>The good thing is that most companies are exploring the selling of PDFs.

If you have a complicated system of 4 different colors with different meanings, my buddy can't tell the difference. Plus, they start getting dumb and hard for sighted people to remember anyway. So having a severly color blind member makes for a good reason to dissuade system designers from making complicated color-based systems. <br/><br/>And if you're doing like 2 colors, you can add stripes to the second color cue to make it easier for color blind folks to differentiate them. Having my friend around helps remind me to consider things like that.<br/><br/>I play in a sci fi larp called Starship Valkyrie and I was recently working on a revised version of the main ship display, which is a big whiteboard that tracks the ship's status. Not only am I going to make the lettering much larger and clearer than the old version, but I've designed a damage track that combines both color changes and section breaks to indicate the damage groupings (0-3 is Sound, 4-6 is Hurt, 7-9 is Critical, and 10+ is Crippled). The breaks make it easier for folks like my color blind friend to see where those groupings are. Plus, they look good in the design.<br/><br/>Actually, now that I think more about it, I think I played with a legally blind but about 10% sighted guy at conventions a few times. If I remember correctly, he liked playing in larps more than tabletop games - I don't think he liked needing to have someone else read his dice for him. He'd have a GM sit with him for a few minutes and read his character brief to him. It's been a long time since I've seen him.<br/><br/>I think nowdays, if you're somewhat tech saavy, you could have electronic copies of character sheets ready to go on a smartphone or laptop. Then if you had a vision impaired player wanting to play your game, you could email them the info and they could listen to it on their smartphone reader program while the other players are reading their own stuff. That would be pretty awesome, and not very hard to accomidate for.<br/><br/>You could easily have a set of games available at a con that were designated as visually impaired friendly. The amount of work beyond regular prep would be pretty negligable.<br/><br/>And, of course, many low prep games are pretty visually impaired friendly to start with. Based on my second hand knowledge of it, Fiasco sounds like it would be super easy for a person with minimal or no sight to play. It only uses 6 sided dice, which are the easiest to read. And there's no stat sheet to worry about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345048/#Comment_345048" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T12:10:16+00:00" title="October  6, 2011 12:10PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2011 12:14PM by Rafu.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://theblindgm.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theblindgm.wordpress.com/</a><br/><br/>Also, seriously, PDF is a format which is only "friendly" towards printing, or reading on a screen whose size matches the expectations of the maker.

I agree, PDF is a stopgap. It's a pretty shit format for reference materials, and accessibility is a big challenge too.  What PDF has going for it is market share and control of a reader's printer.  To me, the latter is a downside, not an upside.

Simply tagging them is a good start.

If you want to talk about alternate formats let me know.<br/><br/>The blind and visually impaired gamers I know play with a laptop open and have their character sheets (for D&amp;D, L5R, Ars Magica etc) set up as spreadsheets. Dice are handled variously, usually electronically. Minis, when they come out, aren't a huge deal since they are tactile and a friend can always describe visual relationships. If you want to chat with a blind gamer let me know and I will hook you up. At the table it is less than no big deal.<br/><br/>My sources tell me anecdotally that roleplaying games are hugely popular at state schools for the deaf and blind.

For now the tokens are punch-board, but when we've got the extra funds, we're going to have 3d molded tokens with distinct raised patterns on them, which will also help. And I'd love to manufacturer embossed Lifewheels so the entire surface of the board can be read with the fingertips, but that's a little ways away at this point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345159/#Comment_345159" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T06:33:00+00:00" title="October  7, 2011  6:33AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skip to 4:15 in the video above.

So the real key is to find some entity with a Braille printer (like a university disability services office), negotiate, and show up with a stack of paper and a few chocolate bars. You could also query the NFB and see if there are volunteers in your area that will help out.<br><br>Side note - Steve Jackson Games at one time had such a hook-up and would make a Braille version of their products on request.
