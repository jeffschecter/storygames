We took turn - in your turn you read a paragraph, lead the group in choosing the option, and then they pass the book to the next player.<br/>We needed some house rules - we axed the dice-based combat mechanic in favor of having the players take turns to describe a 'blow' of the combat until we felt it was resolved. We occasionally held pages and jumped back if we 'lost' the game, because that's a horrendously bad mechanic.<br/><br/>Now, most of the books are terribly designed (lots of false choices), but the actual play is really good fun and (this it the killer for me) really accessible to none-RPers.<br/><br/>It's important not to take it too seriously - we were treating it much like a group of friends enjoying a bad film - and to have house rules which lift the story off the page and give the players extra creative license.<br/><br/>Any thoughts? Anybody else tried this?<br/><br/>My initial idea is that a well written choose-your-own-adventure, passed-n'-played, could provide a group with an enjoyable narrative experience to rival popular novels like Harry Potter and the Hunger Games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_404620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404620/#Comment_404620" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T19:55:28+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  7:55PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You may be interested to know that Project Aon is releasing a bunch of the Lone Wolf books with a little software reader tool that allows you to play them directly.  <a href="http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/WhatsNew" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/WhatsNew</a><br/><br/>I've never played them in quite the manner you describe, but back in the day a friend of mine turned Firetop Mountain into a sort of dungeon, and we played it rather like an RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo" title="Edmoo"><img alt="Edmoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo">Edmoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404635/#Comment_404635" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T01:08:00+00:00" title="January 26, 2013  1:08AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, a whole group of us went on a adventure-book frenzy after new year, so I soon tracked down the Aon Lone-Wolf stuff. Thanks though - that's the gift of nostalgia!<br/><br/>Yeah, now I think about it FF was the first step in my roleplaying - In primary school I used to bring a dice and we'd sit around and free-form dungeons. Ha - a rival group even started up!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
