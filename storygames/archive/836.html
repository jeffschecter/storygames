                    In another thread, Brendan mentioned:<br/><br/><code>I want to see the episode where, since they can't run the same mission twice, the characters have to sneak into the traveling facility to warn themselves before they went on that disastrous mission last week.</code><br/><br/>What other classic time-travel tropes are there?  What not-so-classic but really-really-cool time travel stuff do you think would be fun to do in a game?  What are interesting limits and paradoxes beyond the obvious (meeting yourself, altering history) and what are your favorite ways of handling those things?<br/><br/>Full disclosure: I'm running a <i>Nobilis</i> game where time travel has somehow become a major theme, and I would love cool new tricks to add.  However, I also think this would be useful in general, since doing new things with an old genre (like the time travel story) is always good.<br/><br/>I'll kick off with a couple of classics:<br/><br/>- The PCs are stranded in the past (or future) due to a device malfunction.<br/>- The PCs are accidentally sent to a time other than the one they intended to go to.<br/>- The PCs encounter and aid themselves.<br/>- The PCs encounter and hinder themselves.<br/>- An apparent <i>deus ex machina</i> occurs, which the PCs later go back and arrange to happen.<br/><br/>Other ideas?<br/><br/>--Jess                </div>

                            Maybe this counts as 'aiding yourself' but I remember a time travel movie (Time Rider?) where the time traveler is his own grandfather.  It's a neat little loop actually, because he carries something of his grandfather's (the last thing he gave his grandmother)--he knows he is his own grandfather because she takes it from him before he disappears into the future.  <br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of little 'islands' of self-contained causality--and you could definitely move it outside the romantic edge.  Like in the Search for Spock where Scotty provides someone with the technical knowledge that leads to some minor innovation that will play a role in starship development.                        </div>

                            In the finale to my Stargate game, the PC's chased after rogue time travellers into the earth's past, but weren't able to stop the rogues from changing the future. So when the PCs returned to the present, the galaxy was over-run by Mongol aliens. Fortunately the Golden Khanate, had discovered a way to combat the forces otherwise laying siege to the PCs original timeline. So they stole the information, went back to meet their earlier selves who were about to head to the present, and gave them the info, with instructions to contact a strangely cooperative alien a year prior to when they first encountered him, to have him construct the weapon. Then the PCs who stayed stopped the timeline change, and went to the future to see if things worked out. Fortunately things did work out, and quite a few other things had changed, the longest lived PC recieved a note from his other self, written to him by a third self, who (presumeably) was from his own future. The note told him to go to another point in the "objective" future, but no reason was given. When the PCs went forward again, the found themselves greeted by strange ships, apparently expecting their arrival, greeting them as fellow time travellers. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the time travel hurt their heads too.<br/>
<br/>
In short, time clones can be fun (if your cosmology works that way), and the best deus ex machina aren't blatant, but subtle. It's best to look at the events so far, and look for any lucky breaks. <br/>
<br/>
For more bizzare time travel tricks, take a look at Primer. "Sure you can drug your earlier selves and take their place."<br/>

<i>Transparent aluminum?</i><br/><br/>Yeah...I thought that, but it just sounded so goofy in my own head.  Note to self: Star Trek *is* goofy.<br/><br/>Which reminds me of the Star Trek variant on the island of causality: Next Generation where each loop 'adds' a little something to the old loop, so that it becomes possible to decipher clues from sent from a 'previous' loop in order to break out of the loop altogether.  For game play, it would probably only be fun to play through one or two of the last loops, otherwise I imagine it gets a little tiresome...                        </div>

Also, I'd like to see the travelers trying to influence a particularly delicate era that they don't have permission to enter--so you have one squad in the city twenty years before the Dangerous Event, one squad twenty years after, and the future squad has to update the past squad (via Tachyon-Talky) on how their actions change things.                        </div>

                            One idea: make the changes actually impact the future the players are from.  Make it such that there is a time delay in how those events reach them, almost as if it has to 'make its way' through the time stream to the moment from which the players departed.  The closer they are to their home time, the more pressure is on them to get it done right.  <br>
<br>
It makes the trips to the future a bit of a relief--no worry about being caught in the wave (unless it's the wave of something they did in the near past of the future they are in...).                        </br></br></div>

                            Simon Hawke's <i>Time Wars</i> series of books started off with temporal terrorists, who were trying to alter the past.  The first several books had the heros dealing with them.  It was nice because it kept things from being too easy, with the heroes having access to future knowledge and tech, but the terrorists having it as well.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the series, a "timestream split" occurred, which created a parallel timeline.  In the temporal physics of the series, that was considered an unstable situation -- it could last for a while, but eventually, one timeline or other would become the "real" one, and the other would cease to exist.  This led to a full-scale time war, with each side trying to manipulate events in the other's past so as to cause more timestream splits (the idea being that destabilizing the other "branch" of the timestream would make their own be more likely to be the one that survived).<br/>
<br/>
At some point in the series, there was a villain who believed that a stable timestream split was possible, where both timestreams would continue forever, and was trying to cause one.                        </div>

                            The classic Doctor Who thing is that the Doctor turns out to be responsible for some great event in history.<br/>
<br/>
It's done very tongue in cheek. For example, there's an episode in 1666 where, as a result of defeating whatever needed defeating, the Doctor starts a fire. As the fire spreads, you see the name of the road where the fire started: "Pudding Lane".<br/>
<br/>
(If you don't know, that's where the Great Fire of London started).<br/>

                            How about an episode where the PCs have to go back in time to stop another traveller from intentionally fucking with the past, only the other traveller is trying to do some kind of major good.  Like trying to kill Hitler.  So, the PCs have to save Hitler.  For the good of the universe.<br/>

                            Another cool effect would be to have time stop and only the players can get it started again. they would be the only ones moving in a still world, except for the bad guys of course.                        </div>

Ironically, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure' still holds that position.  'Primer' is a close second, but for completely different reasons.                        </div>

<p>One of these days I'm going to have a Star Trek episode where the premise is this:</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Mayhew is a destructive moron.  On numerous occasions he has hijacked Federation starships to make personal visits to pleasure ports, as well as firing on allied ships whose captains he doesn't like.  Believe me, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he has the ultimate trump card.  "I'm sorry, but the Temporal Prime Directive forbids me from explaining why these actions were necessary."</p>
<p>You poor saps have had to <em>serve with him</em>.  Enough is enough.  You've taken your collective leave time, and a runabout, and headed toward the planet Plot-Wholium to make use of the Gates of Destiny.</p>
<p>Your goal?  Contact <strong>every future and past organization with time travel capability</strong> and get documented assurances from each of them that Mayhew has never worked with them.  Since many of them are enigmatic on principle or even actively antagonistic to the Federation this may be ... tricky.  But man, the look on his face will be worth every iota of effort and suffering.</p>

                            Two things.<br/>
<br/>
1. One way you could play "time-cop" stories (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history_%28fiction%29 for a good summary of what has been done with the "time-cop" trope) is kind of the reverse of the usual player/GM relationship to plot. Usually the GM has a plot not known to the players and must (to some degree) wrestle them to keep them on track - at least, that's one model of GMing. With a "time-cop" story, the players know what the plot is supposed to be - and the GM throws them curves as they try to get it to be like that.<br/>
<br/>
2. Has anyone else read Connie Willis's "To Say Nothing of the Dog?" Great (and hilarious) time-travel yarn, except really it's a historical romantic comedy with time-travel as a background. In her setting, you can't land at a place in the past where you're already present and you can't land within a certain distance (temporal or geographical) of a truly pivotal historical event - for example, nobody can get within years or hundreds of miles of Waterloo, because relatively small changes would have made the outcome of the battle quite different (apparently). When I say "you can't land" I mean the universe, or the laws of physics, or something prevents it - you can try to land there but you will be "deflected". So you have to make your way through time and space the old-fashioned way at least part of the distance to get to any really significant, pivotal event, and this gives plot room.                        </div>
