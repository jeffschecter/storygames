I'll keep this brief. <br/><br/>I like playing me some Moldvay D&amp;D and I've come to the conclusion - like many - that the game works at its best when procedure is adhered to pretty rigidly; sticking to turns and tacking the time actions take is the main drive behind the challenging gameplay that makes Moldvay appealing. <br/><br/>Now I come to you, great dungeons masters of time, to help me getting better at keeping my procedural play together.<br/><br/>Right now I've got a scrap of paper behind my DM screen with little countdown clocks and turn-markers which, frankly, I just can't keep track of. I've more than once messed up an entire game by stumbling over procedure.<br/><br/>How can I keep a better track of turns and time?<br/><br/> Can I utilise my players without breaking suspense? Am I missing the point entirely? <br/><br/>Let me know!<br/>-Mike <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455943/#Comment_455943" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-31T14:04:24+00:00" title="August 31, 2016  2:04PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, so one of the hack in my wife's game is that the Caller keeps track of time.

I use little markers and stuff for the torches. <br/><br/>We also have a turn sheet. That contains this:<br/>---<br/><b>Order of Events One Exploration Turn</b><br/><br/>1. The DM rolls for wandering monsters (1 in 1d6) every 2 turns.<br/><br/>2. DM describes, players ask questions. The party explores the area. <br/><br/>3. If monsters are not encountered, the turn ends. <br/><br/>4. The DM rolls 2d6 to check the distance.<br/><br/>5. The DM rolls 1d6 to check surprise.<br/><br/>6. The party and the monsters react:<br/>If both sides are willing to talk the DM should use the Parlay Sequence<br/>If one side runs away, the DM should check the chance of Evasion and Pursuit.<br/>If combat begins, the DM rolls initiative and should use the Combat Sequence<br/><br/>7. End of Turn. Check HP, rest?, marching order, light and spell duration<br/>---<br/><br/>Again, it's super pretty, big and everyone gets one. There is also a sheet for the Parlay, Evasion and Pursuit, and Combat. <br/><br/>When training new folks I have them place a f-off big counter next to each turn until everyone gets the rhythm<br/>. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455950/#Comment_455950" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-31T23:41:00+00:00" title="August 31, 2016 11:41PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anything that takes multiple turns, I make the players track.<br/><br/>I roll wandering monsters every turn\u2014a 1 on the d12.<br/><br/>So, I don't actually need to keep track of anything over time.

That's a hard tendency to fight - you're not on the right side of the battle. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Ultimately, if tracking stuff is not in the players' favour, then they're not really going to see the point of doing it.<br/><br/>For example, mapping only works when it's a necessity (except for rare cases where you have someone in the group who just really, really enjoys drawing maps). Even the group which is most committed to mapping isn't going to do it if, say, they can see the entire dungeon from one place.<br/><br/>I'd say you have to get uncertainty on your side. People make maps because they're afraid of getting lost (for example). If they aren't afraid of getting lost, then why bother mapping?<br/><br/>So, what's the drawback to losing track of time? I can think of two things off the top of my head:<br/><br/>* There's a game-based penalty. (For instance, in cases where tracking hasn't been followed, you have a die roll with potentially bad outcomes. Kind of a 'saving throw' which comes into play when the group isn't certain of how much time has passed.)<br/><br/>* There's an in-fiction reason for tracking time which gives the players an advantage when they do so. Maybe some kind of dungeon design which emphasizes time? For example, if the skeletons patrol on a strict schedule set by their animator, there are traps which only activate at night, and certain areas are only accessible when the tide is low...<br/><br/>You could even combine the two to say that they are exploring dungeons designed by a chronomancer, and the environment messes with your sense of time. If you don't carry an hourglass and keep track, you can get disoriented by weird time-bending magical effects (which you then can back up mechanically).<br/><br/>There's also the possibility of a group which enjoys the logistics challenge and wants to engage in it for their own interest... That would be the "default case" for most games, I think - are the players using the right game for their interests? If they don't want to do so, maybe this isn't the right game for them. The players should be on board with the procedures of the game you're playing, right? But clearly that's not the case with yours...<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455975/#Comment_455975" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-02T13:51:54+00:00" title="September  2, 2016  1:51PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I once saw something that I thought was really good...

Sorry for not getting back to this thread, I wanted to meet back up with the group and do some live experimentation. <br/><br/>Firstly, I followed the advice of simply being forward with my players about how the game worked behind the scenes and that if they helped me to facilitate the smooth running of the system I would be freed up to think about meaningful challenges. <br/><br/>For all of my Real Talk, it was the props that eventually got them all fighting over being caller. <br/><br/>My solution, dungeon cards: <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://s17.postimg.org/bfs9eqdxb/Dungeon_Tiles.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://s17.postimg.org/dydyfeznj/More_dungeon_tiles.jpg"/><br/><br/>Ok, so they're a little scrappy but you get the idea: cards with dungeon sections drawn on that immediately communicate where the party is, its orientation, marching order and where it can see. The only cards that are on the table are where the characters can see with their torches (30 feet being approximated as "into the next section"). <br/><br/>(Yep, them be Catan road pieces for doors.) <br/><br/>Behind the screen, I had a dungeon map and traced the players movements. From there I had loads of fun playing around with different wandering monster probabilities; typically rolling a d12 when players moved section, as suggested above. <br/><br/>The players collectively wet themselves when they ran out of torches and it was just a single card on the table as their 'field of vision.' They started running blindly back to the entrance when their map-making failed them and they found themselves on an unfamiliar card. Many a "game over, man, game over" was muttered, and they'd not even run into a monster! They eventually escaped, vowing to never skimp on touches again, never let Dale draw the map again and to hire every dark-vision'd elf and dwarf they could find. The fact than dungeons are dark and terrifying is now a reality to these people. Mission accomplished, I'd say. <br/><br/>It's getting better. Needs more play, but I like my props. Tempted to paint some nicer looking cards. <br/><br/>I'm now contemplating using this system to run two or more parties in a dungeon in some kind of PvP game; neither team would be able to guess how near they were to their opponents until they saw a light coming around the corner.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456117/#Comment_456117" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-09T16:42:04+00:00" title="September  9, 2016  4:42PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ohhh.

Although in this model I permitted the party to see into the part of the dungeon ahead and behind if they had a torch at the front and rear of the party (or had darkvision, hence elven archers suddenly being in high demand).  <br/><br/>We had an interesting situation where wandering goblins came from behind and the Cleric acting rearguard elected to throw down his torch and equip his shield. Being the coldhearted mother I am, I rolled 50/50 to see if the (admittedly dying) torch went out. It did and I snatched the rear-view card and the goblin tokens it contained off the table, that section of the dungeon being plunged into darkness. The party howled in fear! \n<blockquote><br/>I don't understand how this resolves your issue, however! How did it help you track torch usage, time, and so forth?</blockquote>\nThe cards visualise the passage of time (as well as space, conveniently) - it's a single turn to move to a new card, given the party is moving with caution. Every new card laid down requires a d12 wandering monster roll and a tick-down on torches (handled through each torchbearer counting on a d6 token next to their character chit on the marching-order tab). All very physical, very tactile. \n<blockquote>A "little scrappy"? Those dungeon cards are excellent!</blockquote>\nThanks guys. Literally thrown together as of a moment to suit my needs. What I'm trying to work out is the composition of a deck of these things to cover most/all dungeon traversing contingencies. You may think the deck wouldn't need to be all encompassing but my players are already talking of hiring torchbearers to form a "supply line" back to the dungeon entrance to try prevent ambushes; so a reasonable variety has to be available to me. <br/><br/>So: what do I need? 4x corners, 4x straights..? etc.<br/>And: how do I make this more fluid? It'd be fun to see if I can write down some best practice ideas and get other groups to see if this speeds up their crawls.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456169/#Comment_456169" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-11T12:21:15+00:00" title="September 11, 2016 12:21PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2016 12:27PM by komradebob.">edited September 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did you deal with variable movement/search speeds based on encumbrance/armor?<br/><br/>Did they discuss the possibility of getting lightly armored demi-human scouts (beyond elven archers)?<br/><br/>BTW, if you don't want to draw all of your cards personally, Heroic Maps makes great modular section downloads if you're willing to spill the printer ink and do some cutting with scissors:<br/><a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?keywords=heroic+maps+modular&amp;author=&amp;artist=&amp;pfrom=&amp;pto=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?keywords=heroic+maps+modular&amp;author=&amp;artist=&amp;pfrom=&amp;pto=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456170/#Comment_456170" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-11T14:27:04+00:00" title="September 11, 2016  2:27PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">@Potemkin</a> So the dungeon cards represent an abstraction of the dungeon?

I'm just not that much of a purist and so long as no one's dragging half a ton of gold behind them, I usually let encumbrance slide. Of course, armour is loud and light gives away your position so semi-human scouts in light armour are a possibility but the players haven't started scouting ahead yet. Safety in numbers is the current philosophy. <br/><br/>The movement is "one card per turn" - this assumes a slow, cautious pace. Weapons ready, searching for traps, keeping noise to a minimum. When the party ran to escape a monster and out the dungeon, dropped the cautious movement and said they could make it back to the exit within a single ten minute turn (feasible) if the caller made a choice about direction at each junction and they didn't trigger any other traps or monster - which would end their turn and give the original monster a chance to make a "catching up" movement into the rear of the players. Tense stuff in practice, if a little unorthodox. <br/><br/>Thanks for the tip. They're handsome cards. I like any excuse for a bit of making though. \n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">@Potemkin</a> So the dungeon cards represent an abstraction of the dungeon?

If they found a larger room or ventured outside I would dispense with the cards and go to larger-unit timekeeping/travel. The cards themselves are abstract, but then my dungeon passages map is abstracted too (I'll upload a picture in a bit) being a tile-grid of 2x2 corridor boxes (corners, junctions, vestibules <i>et al</i>) which wind in a maze with "exit to Room G" etc. annotated on. So not a "real" dungeon, but it facilitates the imagining of one. <br/><br/>So, it would be fairly easy - I'd imagine, had I the requisite skills - to build a program to generate dungeon maps like this. It probably already exists.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456188/#Comment_456188" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-11T20:24:44+00:00" title="September 11, 2016  8:24PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The B/X armored movement ( and encumbrance modifiers) rates already include searching and mapping and so on.<br/><br/>If they haven't realized it, those different movement rates can be a very, very big deal.

Having a scout/picket, un- or lightly armored, out 90' from the party generally means that the wandering monster encounter distance is measured from them, rather than the center of the party, which usually gives them quite a bit of heads up and prep time, even with a wildly aggressive monster encounter.<br/><br/>It also means that thieves and MUs have the best escape chances if it becomes every man for themselves <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/></blockquote>\nIt's not perfect, to be sure. Just in the same way that B/X isn't perfect, either. I've not quite worked out how the granularity of differing movement rates get incorporated into this system that abstracts movement (which is, I've worked out, <a href="/forums/profile/akooser">@akooser</a> , what it's being abstracted here - not necessarily the dungeon, which can be 1:1 with the DM map, slightly truncated.) <br/><br/>I'll have to play but it may be that scouting parties simply get their own card and I run both movements simultaneously with differing wandering monster odds to account for quieter armour. The system doesn't differ for 35'/round compared to 30'/round: so just as I've made a special turn/system for a "Getting the Hell Out of Dodge" move, I may have to invent one for "Nimble Sneaking." <br/>Um: 'You can Nimbly Sneak any distance until you are interrupted by a Wandering Monster, a Trap or a Locked Door.' - Is that too powerful at first glance? \n<blockquote><br/>Oh yes, what monsters like to call a "buffet line."</blockquote>\nThat and I'll elect that, because there are no PoV characters present, the party still cannot see those cards. Ho, ho, ho. 'You return to a scene of carnage..'\n<blockquote>Wait until they figure out you can cast different forms of Light on objects and throw or roll them!</blockquote>\n'The glowing ball rolls down the corridor. From this distance you can draw few details from the diminishing patch of light aside from more grim masonry.'<br/><br/>Too mean? Or just realistic enough? Abstracted cards don't call for abstracted descriptions of what the character's senses tell them (but behind the scenes that ball is triggering all the wandering monster checks, of course). \n<blockquote>Mike, it sounds like the experience you generated was awesome.

I can get so far as making the images for cards to a decent standard, but how to make them physical things that people could buy is beyond me.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456219/#Comment_456219" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-12T17:53:58+00:00" title="September 12, 2016  5:53PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We might be talking past one another...<br/><br/>I grabbed my old (1981) copy of Expert to look for cheat sheets. Movement rates are summarized on p X2.<br/><br/>The move rates for your ten minute exploration<b> turn </b>are <br/>120'   (unarmored/unencumbered with treasure)<br/>90'     400-600 coins OR Leather Armor<br/>60'     601-800 coins OR metal armored<br/>30'     801-1600 coins OR metal armored and carrying treasure<br/><br/>(Carrying treasure drops you one category. It's a bit confusing honestly)<br/><br/>Your encounter movement rate is 1/3 of that per <b>round</b> ( summarized in chart also, for ease of use)<br/><br/>The Turn includes mapping, moving around normal obstacles, mapping and other dungeon exploration SOP. The per round movement is when it comes time for killin' stuff.<br/><br/>Those different move rates are kind of a big deal. An unarmored scout is moving 4x the pace of a heavily burdened dude with treasure in armor.<br/><br/>When you check the move rates of some of the monsters...it gets scary. Vampires in Expert move 120'(40') on foot, for example.<br/><br/>Now that difference between combat speed and exploration speed has also led me to wonder if a prepared critter, in crisis, on home turf, actually moves at combat speed over a ten minute turn.<br/><br/>IOW, does that kobold sentry who escaped (normal move 120/40) move 400' over a turn ( presuming they are in their lair)?<br/><br/>If so, I've got an idea for a really FFVN type scenario to spring on some players using the full B/X rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
