I know that Smallville's system works partially along those lines and DitV rewards characters who make the story more interesting at cost to their character, but I'm not sure of any others.

It's casual, we're enjoying ourselves, you like lots of adversity and problems but you don't like to actually get hurt. The perfect combat for you is one in which you plan something really clever, try to pull it off but there's a problem, you improvise to fix the problem, the bad guys go down, and you walk away without a scratch.  If you do that, Smallville is just flat not going to work. You only learn in this game from getting hit, from getting angry, insecure, injured, exhausted or afraid, and then going and talking to someone else about it.  If you're never hurt, if nobody ever beats you, you will never accomplish anything.  This is very different and it's going to involve a switch. The first thing you need to switch is from thinking of an injury (it's called Stress) in Smallville as being something universally bad to something that's part of your character's situation.  Much like you liked 'solving the problems' of Firefly combat in our Fate game, you should see failure and struggle as part of the 'problem' of getting to your goals in Smallville."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/halski" title="halski"><img alt="halski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/halski">halski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335859/#Comment_335859" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-24T11:26:01+00:00" title="July 24, 2011 11:26AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Poison'd: enduring duress (taking harm now instead of fighting back) gives you one X per success, and you can use those X's in subsequent fights to roll more dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335871/#Comment_335871" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-24T14:38:50+00:00" title="July 24, 2011  2:38PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady Blackbird: add a pool die on failure, and sometimes keys.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel / MG:  also need failures to improve skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335888/#Comment_335888" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-24T20:24:49+00:00" title="July 24, 2011  8:24PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a Wicked Age rewards you for going up against a superior opponent and putting up a fight (even if you lose in the end).

Once the players encounter that difficulty the player then take the tokens win or lose. If the GM used the tokens to make a bad guy you get the tokens after your first fight with the bad guy but the GM can still keep using that bad guy until you do something in game, like kill him.<br/><br/><br/>There was also a Kill Bill inspired game some years back that had damage you took convert to Fire points that you could spend in your next scene after narrating how you overcame your previous defeat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_335940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335940/#Comment_335940" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-25T08:49:20+00:00" title="July 25, 2011  8:49AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favorite example of this is the With Great Power RPG: There is a plot track. At the beginning of the game, the GM has several decks of cards and ways to use them, and the PCs have one deck together and very little ways to use the cards. As the game progresses, you get into conflicts with the opposition. Conflicts where the stakes are things that the players care about.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to lose conflicts in order to advance on the plot track, and as you advance on the plot track you gain more powers. The last run on the plot track is "You can finally defeat the enemy once and for all" or something to that extent. In other words, it is impossible to beat the scenario/boss/story unless you fail at least four times. Might sound like a little, but the conflicts should really be about things the players care about. In a game I ran, there were about 8 total conflicts until the end (over 4-5 sessions or so?), because the players wanted to Not Fail more than Get That Rung.

The difference between that roll + appropriate stat and a preset difficulty is how much you have to pay in Blood, Sweat, or Tears, to be able to do what you want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the trick of it, though: you *never* roll enough to just do it. So, whenever your character <i>really</i> wants to do something difficult, he must pay through the nose for it - often, quite literally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it's not quite getting stronger the more you lose... But the more you lose, the more you put on the line, the more you get done.
