I'm trying to pull in ideas from other medias though, both from other things with heavy elemental casting systems and more traditional Asian media tropes (mostly thinking martial arts movies). Unfortunately, while I kinda have a handle on several things for the elemental side, I'm actually kinda clueless about martial arts movies and the like. So I figured I'd come by and ask!<br/><br/>I already started a little bit of work on the hack on my blog <a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/2012/10/avatar-world-beginning-stages-stats.html" rel="nofollow">(link)</a>, but I'll summarize all my rambling. I've gotten kind of attached to my stats, Natural, Hot, Solid, Keen, and Fluid (representing the five elements/phases/steps), but am more looking to see if my preliminary basic moves and playbook lists make sense.<br/>What I have for basic moves are: Speak With Honor (polite conversation, Manipulate an NPC), Speak Without Honor (impolite conversation, Go Aggro), Commit Open Violence (Seize Without Force - I'm not attached and am already probably going to axe this), Stand Fast (Act Under Fire), Observe Carefully (currently a combined Read a Sitch/Person), Meditate (planned to work along the lines of Open Your Brain/Gaze Into The Abyss), and Move With Intention (a move for deliberate and interesting motions since those are far more important in this). Bend The Natural Order, the bending move, is sort of a Basic Move, and sort of not.<br/>My playbook set looks like: Firebender, Waterbender, Airbender, Earthbender, Monk (spiritual and wizened, not D&amp;D), Samurai, Martial Artist, Aristocrat, Scholar, Ninja. I'm attached to having the benders as separate playbooks, but other than that nothing's in stone.<br/><br/>So my questions for you all:<br/>What media would you consider required reading/watching for a hack like this?<br/>What action types do you think define the genre? Is my list a good representation? Do I have too many?<br/>What archetypes define the main characters of the genre? Am I missing any? Do I have any I don't need?<br/><br/>No need to do anything further than that, and the media question is really the most important, the rest would just be bonus. Things on Netflix are given priority!<br/>Thanks for the help!<br/><br/>EDIT:Thread title changed to reflect the more general purpose of development that seems to be becoming the trend of this thread for me. Thanks again for all the help folks!<br/>EDIT2: Thread title changed again. Making great progress, would love some more assistance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<span id="latest"></span> <div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394605/#Comment_394605" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T09:37:04+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  9:37AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I looove me some wire-fu movies, especially the crazy SFX-heavy Hong Kong New Wave stuff from the '80s and '90s that are especially relevant to an Avatar game with their mix of flashy supernatural powers and goofy humor (as opposed to the more sober films like Crouching Tiger that don't undercut their drama with strangeness).  I'll provide some more examples later if someone doesn't beat me to it, but off the top of my head, Swordsman 2 is one of my all-time favorites that stars Jet Li (in a somewhat rare comedic role) and is even streaming on Netflix. <br/><br/>I do have a possible qualm with conceptual overlap, in that pretty much all the characters could be defined as a "martial artist" in some respect, so what is that playbook bringing to the table that the others don't?  All the others except the Benders have pretty clearly distinct flavor and social role just from the name.<br/><br/>The other usual trap people fall into is dividing PC types into "fighters" and "nonfighters", when pretty much every character worth caring about in these movies is capable of taking care of themselves in a fight (Chinese Ghost Story is the only exception I can think of offhand), and this is true in Avatar as well... but since AW doesn't really have a dedicated combat focus per se, no one is really "bad" at fighting even if some playbooks are specifically damn good at it, which is exactly right for Avatar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394620/#Comment_394620" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T10:52:42+00:00" title="October 24, 2012 10:52AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exciting! I'll be checking that one out for sure, and I'm excited to hear of more. Cool to know there's a decent number of things that pertain pretty close.<br/><br/>I absolutely understand that. When I was thinking Martial Artist, I can say that I was pretty explicitly thinking of the D&amp;D monk basically, but I see how the phrase is really quite general. Perhaps a terminology change would benefit (I would need an elegant way to say "Kung-Fu* Master") or I could simply fold those disciplines into the benders, since each bending discipline already represents a clear one. <br/>* Could be any discipline, Kung-Fu is a stand-in.<br/>On a side note about the playbooks and overlap, the one idea that's rattling in my head as another role is the Geisha, who I've gathered have a significant role. However, I imagine they'd overlap a lot with where I'm going with the Aristocrat. I guess it'd be Skinner vs Hardholder, but I don't know if the distinction is enough for an Avatar game.<br/><br/>Yeah, I can understand that. I can't think of any relevant Avatar characters who can't fight. I imagine that even the generally noncombatant playbooks here could fight to a degree. And the ability to take moves from other playbooks usually mitigates it by allowing nonfighters to take a move from a fighter if they find they really need to.<br/><br/>Thanks! Given me something to think about, and can't wait to hear even more movies to check out, because that genre you mentioned sounds awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394634/#Comment_394634" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T11:37:23+00:00" title="October 24, 2012 11:37AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have many things to say about this!

Your struggles definitely came to the conclusion that bending and kung-fu aren't really the point of Avatar, and I can absolutely agree, and this seems to be a major struggle with making a game to model the shows.<br/>I, on the other hand, am not exactly attempting to emulate the themes and emotions of the show as much as making a fun hack out of the bending and kung-fu. I intend to focus on that, and that's a lot of why I'm seeking to draw in elements from other martial arts movies and elemental shows/books/other media. By bringing in these other bits, I kinda hope the game would lose its explicit connection to Avatar and by doing so free itself to being more about the genre of Supernatural + Kung-Fu than about one show's bits.<br/>It's less about the Avatar world itself and more about Supernatural + Kung-Fu, with Avatar as my main touch-point. I certainly hope that the framework can model the experiences and arcs of Avatar, but it's not my primary focus, since I think the action and magic bits are what interest me most and what I think my group is really looking for in it. I'm definitely going to ask about that to make sure though.<br/><br/>Still, thank you a bunch, it's definitely helpful for me to actually keep that in mind and it helped me clarify what exactly I am trying to do with it. Also, damn! I was AT Go Play NW and I think I actually passed up the chance to play in that game! It sounds awesome and I can't wait to see further developments of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394660/#Comment_394660" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T13:51:57+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  1:51PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet.

Wulin/Weapons of the Gods is a valuable source of GM advice and watch-list recommendations.  Feng Shui would also be useful to read, because Robin Laws is all about genre emulation, and that's the book that taught me that silliness and sincerity are not at all mutually exclusive in the action genre. <br/><br/>Mist-Robed Gate is probably not too useful for this project, because it and its advice focuses on the arthouse stuff, which is also cool but definitely a very different style than you're going for.<br/><br/>Actually, if you can find a copy of WotG I recommend it, because Wulin's mechanics are greatly cleaned up but WotG's prose is way better written and exactly in the vein you want.  <br/><br/>I've had a pretty busy week so I'm not going to be able to toss up my own set of recommendations for a bit (which will probably end up being largely redundant with Feng Shui's as well, since that's what got me into HK movies), but you should definitely go watch Swordsman 2 in the meantime.  Don't worry about the sequel thing, I've never watched the first one myself.

And further integrating the styles into the Bender playbooks just further obsoletes the Martial Artist playbook, so bonus.<br/><br/>And yeah, I'd thought about Light! The little thing that keeps me from touching Light is that a lot of thematic stuff in the show, especially with the Avatar's role, is about balance, and with Light having such an obvious polar opposite, it'd bug me a bit to not have an explicit Darkbending as well. Not enough to keep me from doing it though!<br/>I agree about it being very stylistically sensible though, so hey, why not that AND sound!

Just now I posted up a post detailing my understanding of the martial arts the bending arts are based on, and how I think I might be able to do the hard/soft (offensive/counteroffensive) styles in play. Mostly it revolves around the benders's little subsystem specialties, but the Earthbender (as the main counteroffensive) is an alteration to the Stand Fast, allowing for defensive action to return some of the attack.<br/>Additionally I confront how to deal with Ty Lee and the Kyoshi Warriors and their ilk, the light warriors who aren't stealth-based. As orphans from the removal of the Martial Artist playbook (which I'm better off for btw, so thank you), I'm thinking I need to rethink the basic idea of the Ninja playbook to fold them in.<br/>I also design a tentative playbook art for The Samurai. Because I had the idea.<br/><a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/2012/11/avatar-world-art-martial-arts-of.html" rel="nofollow">HERE IS THAT POST</a><br/><br/>I did a brainstorming of some playbook move ideas a few days ago, mostly dealing with bending powers. I also contemplate the removal of The Scholar playbook as well, but Jonathan Reiter set that straight by mention how he could use technology, which is a unique niche. So the scholar is still on the table.<br/><a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/2012/10/avatar-world-playbook-moves-brainstorm.html" rel="nofollow">HERE IS THAT POST</a><br/><br/>In the post between those two, I directly confront some issues that Jonathan brought up on Google+. One of those is The Scholar's moves, and I fairly easily generate some ideas. More importantly, I do a lot of discussion about how the Stand Fast and Move With Intention basic moves are different and how they function, plus I generate a preliminary formal wording for them. I also begin my thought process on how exactly to model an honorable warrior in the AW system. I have ideas, but that's going to be a long process.<br/><a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/2012/11/avatar-world-answers-honorable-samurai.html" rel="nofollow">HERE IS THAT POST</a><br/><br/>Click and read whatever interests you.

I really /want/ to be able to comment on the Earthbending move but I am a bit stumped with it myself. Maybe Bolin could provide some inspiration, he has a much more 'standard' style than most of the eartbenders we see in the show, I would maybe consider some kind of pool of 'Resistance', almost in opposition to the Airbending style, but a smaller pool that, rather than needing to be built up, is instead worn down steadily over the course of the fight, or replenished every round and becomes an offense/defence management game within the style? (A lot of earthbending strong offenses do leave them open, but their strong defences are night-impregnable.) <br/><br/>The way that I would run waterbending would actually be to run all the many many variant styles as just based off different stats. The PC CAN have water, steam and icebending, but it is more likely to lead them to a spread that will make them much less efficient. In addition vapour manipulation appears to be very rarely used for offense, and more to gather water in order to bend(Compaction?), or sublimation for haze. Temperature manipulation would, I theorise, be a really considerable effort. <br/>If we take Katara as an example, say, her repertoire includes:<br/>Waterbending- Amazing -Clearly Fluid<br/>Vapourbending - Out of combat or cover usage - Maybe off Fluid too for that sake?<br/>Healing: She is pretty good. I actually really like the changes that you have made to heal regarding time.<br/>Bloodbending - She is... OK - I think this should run off Hot, it is really a form of social domination in concept. I would be really tempted to have it as a roll, on a success add the tag 'bloodbent' to the individual, which gives them some chance to break free (Maybe running off a form of the Meditate move? It appears to be a concerted effort, and struggling appears to just make it worse, see Sokka).<br/>Icebending - Pretty proficient, but rarely used - I would actually run this off Keen. Not only does it work with the Metal/cutting aspect of the facet of the element, but also with the conceptual idea that it is really a weapon of war more than it is a utility for many waterbenders.<br/><br/>Plantbending I would actually consider running off Solid. The foggy swamp tribe adopt these remarkably rooted poses when they move their hovercraft that bear a lot of similarity to some of the Ox and Horse stances in Earthbending. (On that note, I'd be tempted to run Sandbending off Natural or fluid due to its similarity to airbending/waterbending, also, with all those circular motions)<br/><br/>Similarly, with the standard +1 stat moves, maybe switching them to plsu one to moves with a 'bending' descriptor of some sort, except for the Air one, which in turn could be the Airbender's 'Condition', if their variant styles ran off different stats?<br/>Those were just my first thoughts... But basically I am really excited about this, I think it is pretty great what you have so far!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401094/#Comment_401094" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T13:47:26+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  1:47PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely need to see Korra. All that sounds helpful and I would love to watch Bolin bend. Yup, gonna make that my next goal...<br/><br/>I totally could do that, basing it off different stats. My troubles are that either I'm going to need to axe a couple of the waterbending types (because I DO want the Waterbender being about Fluid and if I switch it I'm going to have Fluid moves in the minority, so I'd need to support it with Fluid moves) or maybe just have a lot of moves. That's one of the few serious benefits of Phase Mastery, it consolidates a couple into a single move, but yeah, it's not perfect for sure.<br/>That's definitely a possible solution though, and I'm gonna try writing it up with something like that as well.<br/>One of the things I was going for with vaporbending being offense-capable was also that I'm trying to make this at least vaguely functional for outside of the Avatar universe directly. I can easily imagine vapor being used AS an offensive measure, even if not particularly used that way in the show. The offense bit was mostly for show though - I intended for the main benefit to be "water anywhere." I'd forgotten about fog/haze entirely, that should definitely at least somewhat be relevant in the move.<br/>That's an interesting idea for bloodbending, I'll definitely be fiddling around with that. I've pretty much decided that I like Hot for sure.<br/>Keen for Icebending is good! I'd written Ice before I'd decided to do some alternate bendings with different moves and skipped over it afterward, connecting it with keen is a good thing. I'd actually not really thought about how rare it is for Katara to actually use it - I'm so used to thinking about Waterbenders in the polar concepts and how they're often surrounded by snow and ice that I'd kinda just assumed she used it quite a bit, but that's not really how it went!<br/>Solid for Plantbending is a good call. I like Natural for the thematic elements, but I think Solid is more practical for the move itself, yeah. The very rigid stances, plus while the Waterbenders rarely use their legs for bending pre-Korra, the Earthbenders do a LOT of it, and the Foggy Swamp tribe are the exception in that they also use their legs and footing significantly.<br/><br/>...I'm gonna pretend I didn't entirely forget that sandbending was a thing. That certainly will fill in at least a bit of my issues, especially a lack of Natural bendings because yes, sandbending is totally a Natural thing. Nice that the elements seem to incorporate opposites some (Earthbenders with a Natural bend, Waterbenders with a Hot bend, Firebenders with a Fluid bend, maybe I'll key an Airbender to a Solid bend, though I'm not gonna stretch nonsensically).<br/><br/>Hmmm...I've been slightly dodging around having a Bending keyword on things to try to open it up a bit more to cross-playbooking, but that hasn't really been a focus anyway. Absolutely going to try to write out a version of the +1s like that.<br/><br/>But thank you so much!

This was among the first things I thought about when considering how to handle alternate bendings, and is still a big option, but I went against it for the first run. Mostly I did that because I'd have two real paths to take: write them for smaller bending styles that aren't wouldn't get as much screen time or aren't necessarily a major component of the element and run into the problem of having a harder time writing multiple moves for the supplemental playbook, or I could write them for the major alternate bendings and easily write enough moves but risk alienating that as not a "major" part of the element. Put more simply, I would either need to write several sandbending moves or pull the metalbender out of the core playbook.<br/>Now, I could certainly try! It's just a bit more of a challenge to write a lot of moves. Also I'm hesitant about using supplemental playbooks as a core gameplay element, though not hesitant enough to not actually do it.<br/><br/>Also, I'll bring it up here as well because someone mentioned it on Google+ to me: What's the deal with coolness of the Lightningbending option where it fizzles out? It happens on the odd occasion in the show from what I recall (I think Zuko messes up a couple times, even when he could redirect the lightning), and it offers an escape route from the move if you roll poorly but can't afford the penalties that come with the other options, but it runs into the obviously problematic issue of, well, fizzling out can be pretty dull. I think it's mitigated a bit by the fact that the player has to CHOOSE to fizzle out (it's not just any old null result, it's still a risk/reward choice), but boringness is bad and I'm not entirely sure that there SHOULD be a problem-less result when you lightningbend - choosing that move kinda says you want to be taking risks. Any opinions one way or another?<br/><br/>Thanks for all the help James!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401188/#Comment_401188" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-18T14:36:26+00:00" title="December 18, 2012  2:36PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2012 2:38PM by Antisinecurist.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi!<br/>I looked this over some and may have some feedback when I have more time to look at it in detail.<br/>I just wanted to pop in and mention a thing I've been working on.<br/><br/>It's also an AW hack for Avatar-esque play, but it does a few things in a kind of strange way.<br/>I wasn't planning on sharing it publicly, yet, so it's not super-cleaned-up, but maybe you'll find it interesting or helpful in some way.<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B9DLfbmOYNihX1Q4SDZNRUQtbms/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B9DLfbmOYNihX1Q4SDZNRUQtbms/edit</a><br/><br/>Anyhoo, I'll try to pop back when I can and take a better look.

Three moves max per weird variant bending style, maybe? If you decided to go the additional playbook style.<br/><br/>With regards to the lightning, maybe it fizzles and adds a tag like [flatfooted]? It certainly appears whenever the lightning fizzles out, as it tends to cause that misjudging of where foes are, the lightningbender is caught. <br/>One of the things I find great about Avatar is in the stories it tells through motion. You can really tell when, where and how an individual was brought up by the way they fight. Iroh's firebending, for example, always belies the training he had under the more water-influenced styles, and the difference between the sharp discipline of Zhao's strikes compared to the rather lax stances of the generic firebending soldiers really shows the difference between a personal tutor and an en masse school. I figured that might be really useful in influencing the design of some of the scholar class, or even some of the benders.<br/>(Lin's style of metalbending actually is sneaky spoiler-fuel if you pick up on it soon enough, but I won't mention anything beyond that~)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401330/#Comment_401330" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-20T11:26:41+00:00" title="December 20, 2012 11:26AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Alex, that stuff looks pretty cool! I like the draw system, very different and interesting compared to the standard. The refreshes in particular interested me - they look <i>perfect</i> as an incentive to play to the style of the kinds of characters of the show. Real stellar work there for sure. Thanks for sharing, I'll keep looking through.<br/>As for lightning, between the two of you I've pretty much decided that fizzling will be some variant of "open and vulnerable" as well, which makes sense and is exactly what I needed. The condition one is significantly milder, but I think I'll just axe that one and just have two options.<br/><br/>I'm thinking I AM gonna take a stab at giving the minor bending styles their own sub-playbooks. ~3 moves is definitely right, and keeping Phase Mastery, Metalbending, and Lightningbending as the core playbook alternative-bendings will work good. I might eventually write those up as having a couple more moves related to them as well, but that'll be after a lot of other stuff.<br/><br/>I definitely agree about stories through motion. That was the big motivator behind the idea of Stance Focus, which for Iroh v Zhao especially it works (the generics in this circumstance don't have the move at all and are not efficient at either Stand Fast or at Move With Intention). I'm thinking I could totally give the Scholar a move like that, but I think it might even be more useful to give the Aristocrat a motion-based move. The Scholar has technology and that alone ought to get him some movement, but the Aristocrat may end up pretty static, and dynamic is always the way the show looks. Maybe something around "When you Speak Honorably with extravagant hand motions and grand gestures..."<br/>The Monk, on the other hand, I think I might give focus to stillness as a contrast to the others.<br/><br/>Agggh, you're teasing me with Korra!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401609/#Comment_401609" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-23T13:47:00+00:00" title="December 23, 2012  1:47PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There, made up a new post about the new use of sub-playbooks, including a complete (but rough) write-up of The Plantbender.

I would maybe give the weird bendings a bit of an 'umbrella' entry requirement, that being the particular affiliated basic bending, and meeting an appropriate tutor. It just feels like it would be better to integrate if you wanted to do other 'Avatar-inspired' settings, rather than having to switch requirements across them.<br/>The Plantbender looks great, and if I get a chance to run this (Which I hope I will), plantbender will probably be one of the first things to test. It is actually my favourite of the bendings in the show. The advantage to Plant Monster(Maybe 'Plant suit'? I think he refers to it as that at some point...) being Natural, as opposed to standard Plantbending being Solid, I'd think, would actually be to limit the power of the move via MAD. Huu, for example, is probably so proficient at it by virtue of being Natural/Solid/Fluid in his priorities. We rarely see him waterbend. Limiting bending whilst in the suit is narratively justified (He didn't bend water away when Katara attacks him in The Swamp, although this could be due to having a lower Fluid) and although numbers may need tweaking in practise, as a basic outline, it looks pretty thorough. <br/>-I had great fun with a plantbender in an Avatar Wushu game set at the South Pole who had no idea how to deal with all of this snow-<br/><br/>I'd be really tempted to slide in additional playbooks for the Samurai as applicable to say 'Kyoshi Warriors' or 'Piandao's school'.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401652/#Comment_401652" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-24T11:10:19+00:00" title="December 24, 2012 11:10AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 25, 2012 12:31AM by horn_head_o.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, pretty much my thoughts on entry conditions.

The show already sets these up as a fairly important thing, and also acts as a great character creation tool, because rather than going for a relatively rigid 'Keys from the Book' method, you can instead do it in a more freeform, but still directed, DRYH-alike style.<br/>Each Chakra represents a different form of motivation or physical attachment of the individual to the world around them, can be blocked by negative attachment(First in the list), and actually represents something neutral in nature. You could really use either depending on how you wanted to run it...<br/>1. What do you Fear? Actually represents the urge for survival.<br/>2. What do you feel guilty for? Actually represents the human search for pleasure.<br/>3. What are you ashamed of? Actually represents willpower and human strength to continue. (Might have trouble differentiating between the two for some. The great example is that Sokka feels guilty that he could not protect his home when the Fire Nation came, but is ashamed that he was not considered mature enough to go with the other men.)<br/>4. For whom do you grieve? Grief is a negative result of love.<br/>5. What do you lie to yourself about? This positive side of this is in the truth of self. It is an awkward one to really get at... These latter ones are all slightly less grounded.<br/>6. How are we connected? This is almost a fourth wall breaking realisation of the nature of karma, strings if you choose to use them, others chakras, etc.<br/>7. This is the release of attachments.<br/><br/>In a game mechanic sense, I would think 1-5 would make great Keys, with the 6th maybe being the name of an advancement that would allow you to take an additional Key from the preset questions of some sort, as you suggested. (In addition, if you wanted to do something a little more complex you could get characters to mark off karma under each of their chakra pools, with the 7th being the fail pool, such that Chi Blockers could have a weird mechanic of blocking use from under each pool via tags.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401758/#Comment_401758" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-26T10:47:13+00:00" title="December 26, 2012 10:47AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chi was among the list of things I was considering, and is definitely a front-runner. And yeah, that and Chakra are both justified, so yeah...<br/>I suppose I could go with a more freeform style, but I'm actually somewhat fond of using them at least somewhat as driving toward specific tendencies. This seems like the thing that I ought to write both versions and compare. Perhaps even a mixture of the two. Something I enjoy about Apocalypse World is the ease of character creation - it's fast, and for the most part it's selecting from lists. Actually writing phrases or ideas like those are interesting, but something that I think is a little more complex than I (and my group in particular) are interested in it being. Not just setting it aside though, gonna see how I can incorporate that...<br/>I do think that by, at least from the advancement (and perhaps as an option right at char-creation), including the option to write your own (maybe with a prompt) does some to counteract the strict "Keys From The Book" effect.<br/><br/>5 of 'em sounds like a lot... Or a lot to write to at least if I don't just use a generalized prompt. I think still giving Chi when you fail a roll can cover enough that you only need like 2-3 of 'em.<br/>Additionally, if I WERE to do something along the lines of the 7 Chakra Questions there, when do they trigger and Chi is awarded? Just when you take actions related to the various Chakras?<br/>ALMOST-POSTED-THIS EDIT: Wait, did I misinterpret your post as an "instead" rather than just as an addition to things? I'm totally thinking I might have. If so, I certainly could do something like that for just char-gen prompting, but it still feels a little long to me.<br/><br/>I actually wrote something yesterday that you reminded me of (by mentioning the 4th wall). After you'd mentioned the Kyoshi Warriors and Piandao's School as sub-playbooks I decided to take a shot at writing some bits for them. This comes from the Kyoshi Warriors:<br/>" Teamwork: Add this [Karma Key/Chakra]: 'When an ally takes advantage of a tag you imposed, take a point of [Karma/Chi]."<br/>The idea is that the Kyoshi Warrior supports the team by setting up friends instead of always just attacking themselves. It only works when you set others up - when you take advantage of one set by someone else, even specifically for you, using that tag and getting your attack success is its own reward. The other more important thing this says is that not every Chakra needs to be just about in-game actions, they can inspire action through other avenues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401830/#Comment_401830" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T09:51:34+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  9:51AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you did fancy doing something along the lines of the Chakra questions, I'd trigger them with regards to going out of your way to perform related actions.<br/>Say...

Some more specific ideas (such as from things like Kyoshi Warriors) could be a bit longer, but the standard set DOES still need to be loose enough for people to not feel strangled to being just like the show. And the ones like Teamwork that refer to game mechanics as triggers are actually quite broad in their fictional sense too.<br/><br/>Thanks about Kyoshi, I'm actually really happy with the idea myself.

Dao are one sided swords, jian are double-edged.<br/><br/>Earthbending: The heavy format favours larger weapons in general, picks, hammers and axes are presumably very useful. We also see Fans, meteor hammers and dadao within the series. Extrapolation would also lead you to believe the Tiger Fork and Monkey Staff would be useful too (Though the latter may seem especially odd, consider an earthbender keeping the staff close to the body, pushing up blocks with his feet and using it as a focus to push out earth and draw up to defend)<br/><br/>Airbending: For a start, the glider staff and fans are a thing that we see in the show. Aang also posits the concept of an 'Air Sword' and it would certainly make sense in the style. Deer Horn Knives are almost unique to Baguazhang, and are really quite a neat piece of kit.<br/><br/>Waterbending: We see Avatar Kyoshi using fans to make a wave at one point. She really likes those fans, so it could be due to that. Tai Chi does have a fan form. With all the cutting techniques, jian or dao would make sense, those whaletooth scimitars we see water tribespeople use probably have a bending style. As a not-sword style, I would really like to see the flowing motions of waterbending with a spear or halberd-esque polearm that could move quite well.<br/><br/>Firebending: Again, another sword technique, in the dao swords that Zuko uses. The Northern Shaolin styles use spear and sword as their major weapon forms. Circling blocks and stabbing strikes tend to make a lot of their spear forms, which could really work well as a firebending form.<br/>-------<br/>The 'When You Train With a Master' bits, as a move in and of themselves, I think are good. As a replacement/equivalent to sex moves though, I almost feel like they should interact more with the Karma economy that exists above the game. Maybe providing new Karma Keys or something?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402099">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402099/#Comment_402099" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-29T15:10:30+00:00" title="December 29, 2012  3:10PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, that's pretty awesome. Definitely gear list stuff, or at least commentary in a gear section. Most of the specific styles could be built into their own custom moves should characters choose them, or perhaps sometimes gear come with their own moves (in particular, I know the glider staff will have its own move, something along the lines of "as long as you have at least x, maybe 2, Momentum, you are capable of flight with the glider, though it occupies all of your limbs"). A spear style for the Waterbenders could be really neat as well.<br/>Gee, fans are certainly popular, aren't they?<br/><br/>I definitely agree about integrating the Chi stuff into the Master moves. I could absolutely see getting a Karma Key on top of the master moves, and that actually evens out my numbers there - Provide around 4 optional listed ones at char-gen plus the option to write your own. You get 2 (maybe 3) at char-gen, an improvement provides another (also custom-writable), Mastering provides another, and any more you can get from specific moves. That should be enough Keys to get enough Chi to make use of it, especially with failure providing Chi as well.<br/>It's actually really easy to write them for the sub-playbooks, I'm not entirely sure I shouldn't link one into every sub-playbook by default (though I'm not sure I <i>should</i> either) and write another move to fill the spot.<br/>Having come up with the basic idea of the Chi stuff now, I'm probably going to go back and look at my existing playbooks and see if I can't further integrate it a bit. Pulling out some moves to be sub-playbooks instead has given me a little wiggle room to write more moves.<br/><br/>...Yeah, if Chi moves around like it looks like it will, I'm gonna have to make some tokens.

Maybe building weapon styles as per the 'Signature Weapon' rules that the Dungeon World fighter has, with different enhancements? I dunno. I'd be wary of offering too many bonuses to weapon users, or too many stacking bonuses full stop just because. Weapon focuses are fairly rare in general, and you don't necessarily want to have everyone wandering around with them. You could include fists in the style building, and really emphasise that the players are building a martial art form.<br/>The alternative, if you wanted to attach a mechanical effect, might be differing styles similar to how 4th ed have done particularly specialist weaponry with 'feat swap moves'... 'Count as playbook moves'? I guess it would depend on how you were building the warrior too, most benders that focus through wepons could even possibly be built by just taking a few playbook moves from the Samurai as their cross moves?<br/>With regards to gear lists, I think even an 'all bender focus weapons' list might be good, just explaining that some are more common within the fiction/more likely to be used for this style. Then let any bender pick from the list provided they can define it well enough within the fiction. I would be realy interested to see somebody try to waterbend with a hammer...<br/><br/>Within FATE, Dark Heresy and League of Adventure, which have similar economies with Fate and Style points, I tend to use poker chips. I have them around and they are a good physical representation.

I definitely think that a lot of it can actually be folded into single, more concise sub-playbook available to benders in general, with individual weapons being largely ignored in lieu of just how they "bend through weapons" as a more general idea. Really though you're right, it depends on how I build the Samurai and, to a greater extent, the Ninja. The Ninja, despite a rather specific name, is now picking up a lot of the slack from the axed "Martial Artist" playbook, covering a lot of ground as the less-armored warrior approach that is more key to a lot of martial styles. It definitely could just manifest as cross-playbook moves. Still, I feel like a sub-playbook allowing for a more tight linking of the weapons and bending (rather than having both and just stringing the mechanics end-on-end) might be helpful.<br/><br/>Hammer Waterbending is totally swinging the hammer in large sweeping arcs, a compact orb of water a bit further away, using the sweeping momentum to slam the foe with crashing blows with the water, and drawing up frothing waves that smash back down. Yup, want to see that!<br/><br/>Oh yeah, tokens were a given. I have enough TYPES of points now though (even aside from generic hold, I have Momentum, Leaves, Water, Chi, a thing for the Scholar called Materials) that my artistic side is yelling at me to MAKE custom tokens. <br/><br/>So I actually wrote the stuff for the system in place of Hx/Bonds/Strings today on the plane back from Paris. I seriously hope I can keep up this design pace - this traveling has been astoundingly productive for design. Anyway, the social mechanic is a hybrid of Honor and Oaths. I'll write a full post fleshing it out tonight or tomorrow, but the gist of it is this: "Whenever you swear an oath, write it down. When you fulfill or break the oath, something happens, depending on who the oath was with (with another PC, with an NPC, with yourself)." With PCs is an almost Hx-like piece called Honor. It's pretty close to Hx, and I wrote a Help/Hinder move since I'd forgotten to - it's basically the same, but I made the choice to swap it so on a success you can help for +2 or interfere for -1; unlike AW, here it's easier to help than to hinder. With NPCs is a more low-stakes thing, with the main draw being a bit of bonus Chi and, more importantly, return favors and gratitude. With yourself is my favorite, and works well for creating longer-running plot arcs.<br/>So yeah, got that and most of the Scholar to post in the next little bit.

I'd almost be tempted to add an additional mechanic in that, if a PC has two oaths to uphold, he can explain it to one of the oath ties if necessary, and the oath granter gets some chi for deciding that the other one is more/less important, to encourage those kind of power dynamics that occur within the series with the 'go on, leave and fulfil your dream!' and so forth.<br/><br/>The Scholar looks interesting, I would be tempted to just see what questions players tend to ask in play when you give them free range, and then using the most common ones that aren't too silly as your options. And whilst he is a non-combat character for the most part, I have always been fond of 'Fight with your head' things just to keep them alive and engaged when a combat scene is going on.<br/>Maybe some kind of analysis of what the foes are capable of that they can grab from how they move and relay to the rest of the group?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402955/#Comment_402955" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T17:36:02+00:00" title="January  7, 2013  5:36PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, for sure - it's definitely a weird one, and I think it's going to be slightly tougher to test since (like Hx) I think it likely takes a couple sessions to come into full fruition (especially as far as With Yourself oaths go). I'm not so sure about a mechanic specifically about choosing between two (though I know vaguely how I would write it as a move) but that reminds me I want to write something about agreeing to drop an oath. The gist of it would be to make it explicit that if both sides agree to drop an oath, you can remove it without penalty or benefit - I would rather not grant Chi for it since you're ALREADY getting a reward in that you can pursue your own means without restriction. However, NPCs should not often release you from oaths, as most are out for their own self-interest, and With Yourself oaths can never be removed without penalty.<br/>Rewarding the abandonment of oaths, even if the oath-receiver has to authorize it, seems weird to me. I can't think of a way to reward either side without rewarding the kind of behavior I'd rather discourage. I want to do more than just saying that if you both agree you can drop it though, so I'll keep thinking on that.<br/><br/>"Fight with your head" Oh my god how did I overlook this, time to go write a new move<br/>Simple form: "When you use your intelligence to fight, you may Commit Open Violence with Keen instead of Hot."<br/>Easy, helpful, inspires use of a move the Scholar usually wouldn't use, also kinda boring as a move.<br/>Complex form: "When you analyze your foe's combat style and take advantage of its weaknesses, roll+Keen. On a 10+, you deal harm (as established). On a 7-9, pick one of the following: * you made a mistake and open yourself up to attack, * you impose a tag, but are now in immediate danger [!], * you isolate them from their allies, but are left exposed to those same allies, * you're unable to find any openings and keep back out of the fray [!!]."<br/>[!] Immediate Danger is different from being exposed/left vulnerable/opened up to attack in that those are the sort of states where you can be taken advantage of, but when I say Immediate Danger I mean you-take-harm or you-take-a-condition or you-are-captured immediate.<br/>[!!] This is the null result. I wanted something that was not you-fight-but-are-exposed-to-someone, and the null result (while a viable escape route away from the potential danger of the others or of the miss) is what my lack of creativity on the spot here spat out.<br/>I actually am leaning toward the simple one. It's a bit easier.<br/><br/>Speaking of questions, I was worried that Materials, as the central mechanism of the Scholar, was too heavily stilted toward inventor-types, especially to start. I'm considering adding an additional use baked into Always Prepared along the lines of "Spend a Material at any point to ask a question off the Observe Carefully list," or possibly even an open-ended question (though I'm hesitant there).<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403173/#Comment_403173" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-09T10:41:38+00:00" title="January  9, 2013 10:41AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I would maybe word it more along the lines of<br/>"When you use Observe Carefully on an opponent engaging in combat, you can ascertain something about their training and fighting style. Add the tag [Analysed] to the opponent. You may spend one chi at any time to allow you to roll help/hinder."<br/>It turns the Scholar into somebody who becomes a party support class, rather than having a direct damaging roll, telling the other players at the table 'He's weak on his left foot, maybe he had an injury there!' or 'His schooling means that he focuses on wide strikes, stay close!' in order to give them an advantage, but requires him to continue passing these help/hinder checks before his luck runs out eventually and the whole combat caves in and focuses on the guy giving directions.<br/><br/>With regards to the materials working only with the inventor subclass, maybe using it to decrease research time (With materials being library catalogues or relevant texts already at hand, maybe scrolls and parchment to scribble stuff out prepared) or give that bonus for the purposes of think it through. It seems like the other thing Materials could be used for could be a 'oh, I have that book in my bag' or... 'You need one of those? Maybe I have the right thingummy' kind of characters, so an extra move to allow them to reap some benefits to giving out some of their materials in exchange for some benefit, maybe?<br/><br/>And with regards to the promise breaking, I was thinking more along the lines of:<br/>"I promised to get your cat out of this tree."<br/>"Don't worry, go off and save the world, its fine."<br/>"Ummm... OK..."<br/><br/>And then the cat owner gets the chi for deciding its not all that important in the scope of things, which really emphasises the 'not selfish' angle of the game. Though it could end up with players exploiting that in play as a chi mechanic.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403221/#Comment_403221" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-09T14:59:10+00:00" title="January  9, 2013  2:59PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, something along those general lines is good too. Oh well, I'll have SOMETHING for fighting with your head in the end, it was a big oversight on my part to have not written one. The thing that worries me about attaching it to OC is that the Scholar is already likely to do a lot of that, I'm thinking through if there's a way I can do that sort of thing while also encouraging the use of a different basic move that they normally wouldn't use (hence the COV thing). But yes, that's the gist of the type of thing I'm dancing around.<br/>Been thinking, and I don't really have anything really compelling on the Workspace/Home Base thing. About an 85% chance of that being the move to get the axe to make room for a Fight With Your Head move.<br/><br/>Heck, the "I've got just the thing" is the default Material thing I already have under Always Prepared - definitely a use of a Material. But yeah, something regarding research is good, I can see about working that in somehow - it'll be a bit easier once I re-write Meditate and write Think It Through for realz.<br/><br/>The abuse potential is one of the things that worried me. The other big thing is the implication of the rule - you're being rewarded for not holding them accountable to their promises, which while it works in a lot of situations, can also have some weird implications. I don't think it's that bad though, I'm seeing where you're coming from and the more I consider it the more I'm being good with it. I mean, since it has the be the, uh, promisee (? As opposed to promisER I guess?) who cancels out of it, they;re getting a mild reward but don't get the long-term narrative reward of having the promise completed (e.g. he's got a bit of Chi, but his cat's still stuck in the damn tree). There's gotta be a better than promisee for this though...

It now does pretty  much exactly what I think I want it to.<br/><br/>MEDITATE<br/>When you spend time[!] in quiet[!!] contemplation, roll+Natural[!!!]. On a hit, you learn a detail relevant to the subject of your thoughts[!!!!]. On a 10+, declare what that detail is[!!!!!]. On a 7-9, the MC will declare what the detail is[!!!!!!].<br/><br/>That's a lot of exclamation points, isn't it? Let's see:<br/>[!] Yup, you need to spend some time to meditate. This ain't no Epiphany.<br/><br/>...Oh my god, Epiphany would be a great move for something. I've got no use for it right now, but I gotta remember that one.<br/>[!!] "Quiet" is the word I'm going with, but my intention is that you're on your own basically. It's a lonely activity. Considering a change to "concentrated contemplation" but that's really more semantic than effectual.<br/>[!!!] Natural is the biggest difference I did to this. This is no longer a Keen move. It's about intuition and a connectedness to things and nature and stuff, and NOT really about observation and smart thinking. (you may have just guessed what I'm making Think It Through now) I kinda wanted the Monk to have a more Natural focus anyway, and this makes the Airbender, someone who already has meditation as a part of their culture, actually good at it.<br/>[!!!!] You pick the subject when you meditate. This is more of a Buddhist "reflection" type of meditation rather than the also-popular "clear-your-mind-completely" stress relaxation meditation. And you can't just Meditate and hope that SOMEthing comes to you, you DO need to have a topic in mind.<br/>[!!!!!] The most dangerous part of the move. This is an enormous placement of power in the hands of the player. I'm strongly thinking about adding a "(subject to MC approval)" but feel that violates the very spirit of the ApW game structure.<br/>[!!!!!!] This, on the other hand, is great. Yeah, they succeeded, they're learning something. This is a great place to complicate things, reveal things you've had in wait, or spring unhappy revelations. I really struggled with doing a 7-9 at first - you've seen the early draft of the move, and it's not that interesting. The second draft was just Spout Lore basically, and repeating moves doesn't please me (aside from Stand Fast - that one's simple enough and diverse enough to be in pretty much all the hacks. Even Speak Naturally gets a new context from Manipulate thanks to heavily engaging the Oaths mechanic). I'm actually very fond of this version, though possibly that's just because I only just now wrote it.<br/><br/>So what was that I mentioned about Think It Through/Consult The Books? Here, the move is DAMN simple now.<br/><br/>THINK IT THROUGH<br/>When you rationally Meditate on a subject, you roll+Keen instead of +Natural. If you spend 1 Material to consult your books in the process, you can Meditate quickly as well.<br/><br/>The Keen instead of Natural bit was pretty damn obvious. The other bit I think is pretty neat though. It allows you to do so quicker than anyone else can Meditate, and this actually supports that Scholar character who DOESN'T fight but stays out of the fray, frantically looking through his books to find the solution to the monster, calling information out to the fighters. The Material cost is to tie it into his little gimmick, and gives a really good non-Inventor Materials use, but is mostly a last-minute idea of an addition, I haven't thought that one out very much. It <i>feels</i> good though.<br/><br/>Man, this was exactly what I wanted for Meditate.

In the MC section you can bet that I'll <i>talk</i> about what to do if they start abusin' it (cuz it's currently the easiest path to circumvent, well, anything). Asking permission is no fun, and absolutely something that doesn't really have a place in an Apocalypse-Powered game.<br/><br/>I suppose that you could phrase it as Observing The Past Carefully, but I think that's not the only thing I want to be able to do with Meditate. At the same time as a bit of specifying might help with Meditate, I'm actually quite intrigued by the versatility at the same time. I imagine that, at the table, you could even phrase certain actions in a way to blur the line between OC/Meditate, and that's where you would Observe Carefully about the past or some such. It's a strange grey area, but for now I think that I'm going to try out the current Meditate, without MC approval.<br/><br/>I had thought of putting it in the advances actually! Even some AW/MotW playbooks involve advancements like gaining Wealth and a hold, for example. The reason I didn't put it in was, frankly, because I don't have any homebase stuff written. If I can come up with a good idea of what they'd do, it'll be in there for sure.<br/>The weird thing for me is that in a lot of the stuff I've watched so far, there isn't very much sticking-around-a-base stuff at all, especially compared to some of the source fiction for AW/MH. It can be reasoned, and I'm sure I'll have something. Heck, the very fact that Korra revolves around a single place rather than a traveling group should help fuel my ideas once I watch it.<br/><br/>EDIT: Went ahead and just edited the clause requiring specificity in Meditation right into the Scholar post.

Most of them could probably just be changed to 'weapons' of a player-defined description (And might even make a nice description list). The sword focus in general just seems a bit odd to me. Otherwise, it looks pretty great.<br/>With regards to spending Chi for rerolls, I'd almost be tempted to go back to the 'change one dice', or make it 'reroll take the highest/lowest', if only to make sure that it actually had some effect. Spending a resource for nothing is a bit disappointing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403891/#Comment_403891" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T09:00:00+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  9:00AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could absolutely be changed to "weapon," and that is probably a very logical change, but for some reason I'm attached to "sword." When I think of a samurai, it's very specifically swords that I think of. It isn't quite a perfect line-up with Avatar on that account, but it's also pretty fictionally-accurate for the <i>rest</i> of wuxia-type fiction as far as I can tell.<br/>I'll consider it though. I see the merit, I'm just not sure how much I want to change that quite yet. But I certainly might.<br/><br/>As for just changing one dice, I agree, just one seems like a better idea when reading it - I thought the same. Ran it through a dice probability thing though, and it more-or-less forbids it as an option - the dice probabilities are really forbidding. When a player rerolls just one, they're <i>going</i> to succeed, and they <i>will</i> fail when the MC causes the reroll. Exceptions will happen, but it's a pretty sure deal.<br/>I don't think the end result is nothing right now though. I mean, if you have the choice to do so after you've rolled, you <i>do</i> have a better chance to succeed overall (because you're not going to reroll a success). But yes, I'm still not happy with just re-rolling - it's just the best I can think of right now. The big thing that bothers me about it is that after the roll, if you spend the resource, you might be reorganizing the triggering action to hit the tag, and that's weird.<br/><br/>*sigh* Maybe I just do +1/-1. It's boring, but it works numerically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Legend of the Elements] Final 3 Days of the Kickstarter!

It makes me really excited to hear others excited about it too.<br/><br/>I absolutely agree about re-roll over bonus/penalty. It's just too boring that way. I'm feeling that, for now at least, I'm going to try out having it be re-rolling both dice, but I'm thinking that at some point I'm also gonna try out doing it with just one die re-rolled. I have my doubts about the statistic side of things, but maybe that'll be proved wrong!<br/><br/>Wow. The more I think about it being the Guru, the better it sounds. I've a couple of concerns (essentially, name recognition and the literal definition of the words) but those are kinda overridden by the benefits you mentioned.<br/>Hmm. Also considering The Ascetic because it gets around the same confusion issue while keeping the same definition.<br/>But seriously, Guru keeps sounding better and better. Seriously considering that. Thanks!<br/><br/>Sorry I haven't had anything significant to add for like a week. My class is killing me right now and I've been wicked busy. Tomorrow's the last day, so I ought to have a bit more breathing room. I DO have some pretty bare-bones stuff about The Ninja that I've got stewing - I'm met with a desire to try and translate over the Airbender's Momentum mechanic but want to leave the Airbender's niche alone, so I'm tryin' to figure out something else. Other stuff includes using unconventional weaponry, stealth, and fighting in an undisciplined/street-smart way (inspired heavily by Mugen from Samurai Champloo <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bhartung" title="bhartung"><img alt="bhartung" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bhartung">bhartung</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405069/#Comment_405069" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-30T18:53:38+00:00" title="January 30, 2013  6:53PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 30, 2013 6:55PM by bhartung.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chi-blocking strikes me as the big ace-in-the-hole there.

Took a break from this for a little bit so I could do The Doppleganger for Monsterhearts cuz we're starting a game of that soon and I wanted to able to play it.<br/>But, I have a whole draft of that now in PDF form (I'm really proud of it, despite a nagging issue I can't go into), so I'm ready to turn my attention back to this for now.<br/><br/>The Ninja. That's where my mind was last focused, so I'm gonna write up a bit of an outline here for what I'm thinking.<br/>Unlike the Benders and The Scholar, The Ninja doesn't have a pre-selected move. The driving thing for me about the Ninja is that I need to cover a lot of ground. When I killed off the idea of a Martial Artist playbook, most of the characters who would have fallen into that instead fell into The Ninja. The Samurai is a pretty narrow concept of playbook - he's an armored, honorable warrior (though I've decided I'm gonna make it no longer solely sword-specific, despite a little hesitation on my part). The Ninja, on the other hand, is broad. The Ninja is a fast or stealthy warrior who doesn't rely on armor. That's a LOT broader. I want to be able to cover characters like Mai, Ty Lee, and the Dai Li, who are, in general, Ninjas who took Earthbending cross-Playbook, though I may write an unofficial sub-playbook for them as well. Same thing with the Kyoshi Warriors, though I've already written them a sub-playbook, the Ninja needs to be able to do a <i>decent</i> job at emulating them even without it - they're Ninjas who took cross-playbook Samurai moves. I also want to hit historical Ninja ideas, and other anime ninjas. Mugen from Samurai Champloo is DEFINITELY a ninja, and one of my favorite anime characters, so I want to be able to model him. I actually have ZERO experience with Naruto, so if any of you know if I'm covering any of that, I'd love to know. There's just way too much of that show for me to jump in and get a picture that would satisfy me. I know there's a pretty heavy supernatural element to the show's ninjas, but that's mostly covered indirectly by taking cross-Playbook bending moves - the Ninja himself isn't highly supernatural by default, though his actions aren't entirely grounded in reality.<br/>The big thing the Ninja needed to include when it absorbed The Martial Artist is that the D&amp;D Monk is now a Ninja. <br/>Let's check out some move ideas.<br/><br/>Speed: As I mentioned, this immediately makes me want to hijack the Airbender's Momentum, but that's actually easier said than done. However, I want to make it work. It'll make Airbender-Ninjas pretty damn tough, but I kinda like how the two synergize.<br/><br/>Acrobatics/Athletics: This is a things Ninjas do. I'm tempted to call the move "Wire-Fu" and have it trigger "When you attempt a physically-implausible athletic or acrobatic act, roll+Fluid...". This lets you do all the crazy jump-kicking and ridiculous things ninjas do that make no sense. It also lets you fill in some of those fun urban legends about what historical ninjas could do - I'm thinking pretty specifically of water-running.<br/><br/>Stealth: I have two moves in mind for stealth. One is a more general-purpose "Hiding in plain sight" type move, and the other is a Disguises type move. I haven't gotten into really thinking about the mechanism for the former, but I'll likely have some stuff from my Doppleganger work helping with the Disguises one.<br/><br/>Weapons: Again, two ideas. One is a previously mentioned "unconventional weapons" type move, which actually helps cover a lot of things (all the traditional weird ninja weapons like kama and kunai, even stranger ones like Mugen's steel geta, and the vast assortment of things a D&amp;D monk uses, plus even cross-playbook it operates as a move to establish improvised weapons as a sound strategy). The other idea is basically about never being unarmed or some such, but I'm not entirely sure if that's even a move or just something like AW's Many Knives (infinite) thing. It would apply to shuriken/kunai more than anything I guess, so probably the latter.<br/><br/>Fighting: I want to have some kind of move about using a sort of street-level awareness type of move. My mindset of the ninja, despite historical tradition that did place them as military assets, focuses on an idea of a ninja that lives more or less at street level and doesn't fight according to strict combat rules. Essentially, I guess I'm looking for a "Dirty Fighting" kind of move. Again, Mugen is large in my mind with regard to this, but the idea of fighting dirty is definitely the sort of thing historical ninjas did too. Dirty Fighting is probably what I'll end up calling it even.<br/><br/>Supernatural: The ninja has a lot of supernatural force at his disposal in legend. A LOT. From the water-running tricks above to illusory duplicates to invisibility to elemental magic, the ninja is full of unrealism in legend, and despite the fact that a lot of it is obviously historically ridiculous, it's an important thing. There's a few things to touch on.<br/>* Chi-blocking, as Brien brought up. I simply cannot have the playbook without it, since without it we really don't have any way of having Ty Lee. I may alter the idea to be about pressure points as a whole and applying tags, some of which have more narrative strength than others. Perhaps your strike puts them Off-Balance, or makes them Paralyzed, or gives them Stunted Bending or some such. How exactly I make it operate though is a still up in the air. <br/><a href="/forums/profile/bhartung">@bhartung</a>: It likely wouldn't be too powerful, though I won't know til I write it. A fire blast is about 3-harm as is a full earth blow, most water or air strikes come in around 2-harm, a lightning strike is 4-harm. It's degree of overpoweredness is less related to the power of bending itself and more about how much your MC relies on benders to threaten you, which isn't too tough to adjust anyway.<br/>* Invisibility, Illusions: I'm almost tempted to try to integrate invisibility directly into the stealth move, and illusions are sorta more of a detail than a specific thing to really use. I could make something, but I don't actually think it's necessary. I could be wrong though.<br/>* Elemental Power: You can probably guess what I'm gonna say: this is just taking a bending move cross-Playbook. It could be argued that it's different, but for now, this is good enough.<br/>* I'm really tempted to have some Shadowdancer-y stuff, jumping through one shadow into another and stuff. This is just a magical effect I happen to really like and I think it makes for pretty dynamic scenes, and it makes logical sense for a ninja playbook, so okay.<br/>Other than chi-blocking, I may decide to split off some of the magical stuff into a Ninjitsu Magic sub-playbook or some such just to open up my moves options. The entry bar would probably be abnormally low, I'm just trying to save some space on the playbook for the REALLY necessary stuff.<br/><br/>So let's see, that's 1 Speed, 1 Acrobatics, 2 Weapons, 1 Fighting, 1+n Supernatural (where n = whatever the hell I feel like), that's 6+n Moves and that works for me.<br/><br/>So, how's that sound? I've got some homework to go do now so I'll be hopefully back sometime soon with some actual move text. Later folks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405975/#Comment_405975" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T18:12:37+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  6:12PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chi Blocking seems like the perfect condition to lay on someone, allowing your Ninja to just haemmorhage Chi if they want to keep an individual blocked.<br/>The illusions stuff, in reality, is thought to have been based on the use of psychotropic drugs within small explosives (Or those smoke bombs, which ninja are also famed for), I think, though I may be entirely incorrect. It could be a cool recommendation for the Ninja to take a Scholar playbook move for just that... Alternatively, some kind of Ninja consumables that had some freaky effects could play that angle quite well.<br/>Shadowdancing is awesome and amazing, but I'd look at the way the Queen in Monsterhearts is worded in that respect. I'd make it less explicitly motion between shadows, and more just allowing you to do that creepy 'now I'm behind you' trick by downplaying the obvious supernaturalness of it.<br/><br/>Just a few thoughts to ponder on... The rest seems pretty good. I really like more unconventional fighting for the ninja (Also airbender Ninja now sounds too much fun...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405994/#Comment_405994" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T22:09:39+00:00" title="February 11, 2013 10:09PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, let's see how Chi Blocking could work... Keeping in mind that a Ninja is Fluid and Hot.\n<blockquote>Chi Blocking: When you assault your foes pressure points, roll+Hot. On a 7+, they're completely shut down, whether through paralysis, disabling their bending, or some other means, and they take a Tag to indicate this. Whenever they attempt to act contrary to the Tag, you may spend a point of Chi to negate their action. Additionally, on a 10+, you immediately gain 2 points of Chi.</blockquote>\nThe idea here is to leave it pretty open-ended in who it targets, so you can use it against fighters or benders or even support characters (as Ty Lee manages to aim at all three, though there's not a ton of explicit <i>support</i> happening in the show, more just fighters who occasionally do support-y things). I like the idea of spending your own Chi to keep them locked down. The 10+ difference gives you the chance to keep them locked down for free, while if you only got 7-9 you need to dip into your own supply to make it happen.<br/>My issue with this particular version (there was sure to be something, I did just write this out off the top of my head) is that they're even CAPABLE of acting contrary to the tag. I can't find where I actually said it, but even if I haven't, my intention is that tags are narratively binding as well as mechanically. Now, the latter helps inform the former, so that helps, but it leaves the idea of acting against your Tags. Some make sense to act against: the most obvious is <i>Clumsy</i>, caused by wearing Heavy Armor. Now, you can normally act with perfect grace as you narrate, you clumsiness only becomes an issue really when the MC triggers it. I guess I can call this a "passive Tag," as you can ignore (note: ignore as in has-no-game-effect, you ought to still work it into narration sometimes) them until they're triggered. Some, however, are kinda absurd to act against. Let's take <i>On Fire</i>. This should directly inform how you act, and as MC I'm gonna call bullshit if you try to do something like solve a puzzle without first dealing with the tag. Now, the MC doesn't actually have game authority to DO anything about it - if the player insists they're going to solve the puzzle while <i>On Fire</i>, the most the MC can do is trigger the Tag to impede the player. But it would stand to reason that something like this is going to restrict the place you can go narratively. This would be an "active Tag." It's worth mentioning that the passive and active distinction is a design thing, not a rules thing. They aren't formally implemented into the game.<br/>So then there's the trouble of a Tag that seems to forbid contrary action. <i>Paralyzed</i>. <i>Stunted Bending.</i> If you have these, it seems almost silly to try to take actions contrary to them, but that's what this move is about. <br/><br/>Heck, now that I've rambled on about this, I've got a compromise point!\n<blockquote>Dim Mak[!]: When you assault your foe's pressure points, roll+Hot. On a hit, they take the Tag <i>Addled</i> [!!] [!!!]. Whenever an <i>Addled</i> foe attempts an action, you may spend a point of Chi to negate that action. Additionally, on a 10+, you immediately gain 2 points of Chi.</blockquote>\nThat's a little more concise too.<br/>[!] Dim Mak can be used both to refer to the use of pressure points as targets in martial arts, and the specific application of that technique to cause instant death. I mean it as the former.<br/>[!!] Addled is the best word I could come up with. Other ideas included Pressured, Dazed, and Stunned, but Addled was the most appropriate.<br/>[!!!] Yeah, I'm choosing to define precisely which Tag is being inflicted. It makes it easier to justify the effect if I have a specific one to key it off of. I ought to mention though - if you make someone Addled through other means, that's not the same. That's why I'm looking for another word more specific to the pressure point thing, but I don't have it yet.<br/>Now, Addled is one of those "passive Tags" I mentioned. That's a mind-state that you CAN act past, but it can be triggered against you. It's worth mentioning that it can both be triggered defensively by the Ninja to negate the action, but also by others just like any other Tag.<br/>Yup, likin' that one more.<br/><br/>Yeah, I remember reading about that. I was kinda thinking one of the ways I could actually come at the variety of ninja stuff isn't as a move, but instead as Gear, in the same vein as DW's Adventuring Gear - Ninja Tools. It's an item with a number of charges (3 or 5 or something) and when you spend a charge you can pull out an item that makes sense that a ninja might have. This lets you have that smoke bomb up your sleeve, or another shuriken just when you thought you were out, or another wire garrote after your last one got lost in the river. It's a way to have all the tricky consumables without dealing with a lot of finicky stuff to track. Plus it lets me free up a move for something I meant to include but forgot about!<br/>One of the more interesting things about the way a Ninja might fight is that they have an increased use of the environment! I want to have a move based around using the environment to their advantage while fighting. It'll probably look something like "Whenever you trigger an Environment Tag against an enemy, something extra happens."<br/><br/>I agree about not making it shadow-specific, though that's certainly the way I'm gonna play it if I ever play a Ninja.

Been taking the last few days to churn out this behemoth of a page, the Avatar World Basic Game! It describes the core components and mechanics that make up the game, and I mean for the page to be a place I can keep a compiled list of what the most current versions of everything are. Digging through posts can be a bit tough.<br/><br/>Up til now I have everything not directly tied to a playbook, plus I did a couple of on-the-fly rewrites. Most of the basic moves have had any placeholders pulled out, and a couple (like Commit Open Violence) have had minor changes. Almost everything has new commentary about it meant for clarity rather than explaining my exact intent with everything, including a section where I break down Apocalypse World into explainable pieces for those not already familiar with it.<br/>If you follow this thread, you probably know almost everything here already, but it helps me to have everything all in one place. My next step is going to be reformatting some of the god-awful formatting choices I made in there, and then putting some easy links at the top that jump you to the various headings.<br/>I've decided that it's really time I watch The Legend of Korra and I've been holding off revising the bender playbooks (there will be significant changes) until after I've seen the show.<br/>The plan then is to nail down a move list for The Monk/Guru (still thinking on that one) and The Aristocrat, revise everything to a state I'm happy with (that's a long time of work) and then re-watch Avatar tLAB, LoK, and a couple other media pieces recommended early in this thread (as well as a couple of other anime things I've drawn from - I think I've mentioned that Samurai Champloo is having a big influence on the Samurais and Ninjas) to see if I can follow the action in general terms of the game. While I'm doing this, the game will already be in a probably playable state.<br/><br/>At some point, probably throughout everything (to give myself a break) I'll write some stuff for the MC side of things.<br/><br/>So that's the plan, and here's that page!<br/><a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/p/avatar-world.html" rel="nofollow">HERE IS THAT PAGE</a><br/><br/>Any ideas before I dive back into stuff? I'm really hoping that I have the conceptual side of the basic mechanics really nailed and good, though playtesting will definitely change, like, numbers and stuff, I'm really hoping that I won't have to re-concept whole portions of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407309/#Comment_407309" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T00:55:51+00:00" title="February 26, 2013 12:55AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back again, this time with new content!

The ninja has a great concept line running through it, and I love all the moves, but I thinks the maths needs adjusting. Running through the Ninja:<br/><br/>Stealth: Fun, flavourable, works quite well. Probably fine as is.<br/><br/>Environment Master: I prefer option 2 over option 1, but option 1 is outright better and stands up to the higher power level of some of the other playbook moves, which 2 does not.<br/><br/>Wire-Fu: Hmmm... How about When you perform an implausible feat of athletics or a physics-defying acrobatic stunt, roll Move With Intention. On a hit, take +1 forward in addition to your other options, this counts as taking +1 forward from the list? It retains the mechanical ease of use of the MWI option, but also locks the player into that additional choice you present them with rather than allowing them to pick 3 options from the list which could get silly fast.<br/><br/>Ambush: Its crazy... Absolutely crazy. But I really like what you are going for. I'd keep the mechanic, but make the Ninja burn chi for it. Ambush will kill most everything otherwise.<br/><br/>Unconventional Weaponry: I'd maybe tone it down to 2 harm, the Samurai's backup weapon cost and give the Ninja a 3 harm primary weapon with the playbook. Then this move becomes an 'Oh, somebody disarmed me/captured me/broke my sword, guess I'll have to turn up the badass meter' for those inclined to use it like that, but also a totally viable primary weapon choice for others. <br/><br/>Dim Mak: It works well... until you get to the 10+. Maybe rather than extra chi points, free invokes? Same function, but the lack of specificity in the move currently makes it really open to abuse, especially with some of the Ninja's other chi burn/tag exploitation moves.<br/><br/>Dirty Fighting: Welp, combining that with Ambush, MWI and Stealth for a 5 harm start, or reduce their armour if they are wearing any to cripple off the bat. The Ninja is a killing machine, sure, but too much can make things verge on the 'Good for fiction, bad at table' angle. Maybe look at the Battlebabe's harm related mechanics for inspiration?<br/>I would maybe switch it out and word it like this:<br/>When you trick your foe or otherwise deceive them, give them the tag 'Duped' or other fiction-appropriate tag and gain 1 point of Chi.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407392/#Comment_407392" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-26T12:19:13+00:00" title="February 26, 2013 12:19PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I 100% agree about the maths - he's super tough as it is.<br/><br/>Stealth: Thanks!<br/><br/>Environment Master: What exactly is it about option 2 that causes you to prefer it? I too like it since it seems like more intriguing twist of the mechanic, but you're right that its inferior power-wise to option 1. How could I amp up the second option to make it reach the power height?<br/>This is just off the top of my head, but what if I went a little further with the Lady Blackbird inspiration and gave you back an additional Chi on a failure? My instinct is that that's a bit <i>too</i> powerful, especially given the ways this guy can use his Chi.<br/><br/>Wire-Fu: I'm down with that if I can word it elegantly... "On a hit, select an additional option from the list; one of them must be to take +1 Forward."? Works for me. And yeah, 3 from the list is a bit crazy.<br/>Alternatively: "When you...roll Move With Intention. On a failure, still choose 1 of the options<br/><br/>Ambush: <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> you're right, it's completely insane. Heck, I have no idea what I was thinking writing that without <i>any</i> cost. A Chi cost is definitely well within context for this fella, so yeah, probably going with that. It's still completely insane though, and I kinda love it.<br/><br/>Unconventional Weaponry: Actually, that's what I meant in the first place. I, uh, was mis-thinking about my own harm scale. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> Yeah, 2-harm is where that's going, with a 3-harm gear. Thank you for catching it.<br/><br/>Dim Mak: You're right about that, especially with the ways this sucker uses Chi. This move was actually the first written, before I realized I wanted to use Chi-burning as The Ninja's schtick, so straight Chi wasn't as bad before. Originally, I went with that before because just giving straight Chi was a simpler wording than allowing free invokes (plus it's a touch easier on the book-keeping). Turning it to just invoking the move is the right choice - and to keep down the work, it'll just be one free invoke.<br/><br/>Dirty Fighting: This move is kind of a mess. I had a concept and didn't have a mechanic or a trigger to really make it work. Honestly, I'm really starting to lean toward putting this as a Chi Key - ultimately that's the main result of your suggested move too, generating Chi (along with a Tag). It's easier, and it keeps me away from needing to contrive something that I'm really not feeling.<br/><br/>Thanks! These shifts really help ground him a bit more. I knew right off he was too tough, but wasn't quite sure where to go with it. I'm glad I could keep most of my favorite ideas and concepts (especially Ambush, I was worried I would need to completely re-write it) without breaking the game. Glad you like the direction I took him.<br/><br/>And let's drop off a couple concepts I'm kicking around for The Monk.<br/>Aware: If the MC triggers Environment Tags against the Monk, he gets 2 Chi instead of just 1.<br/>(this draws more from its mechanical idea than its narrative)<br/>Energy Flow: When an ally spends Chi, The Monk may spend his Chi instead.<br/>(I kinda really like this one in both concept and mechanic, though it's pretty tough).<br/>Later!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408674/#Comment_408674" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T17:02:45+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  5:02PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so I don't have a new batch of material yet, but I'm still kicking. I just finished watching The Legend of Korra, so now I feel up to speed about the new stuff. More than ever, that show made me see the necessity of The Scholar and Chi-Blocking (having repeatedly thought it was just about Ty Lee, thanks all for leaving me in the dark about its greater significance!).<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised to just how well my Basic Moves and preliminary playbook moves (esp. The Ninja's) held up under the fire of a new show. The thing I was most confused by in terms of linking the show and the moves was that I wasn't always sure how to handle all of the deflection that was going on - lots of tossing aside shots taken at you. I decided this was either taking 1-armor forward from a previous Move With Intention, Standing Fast (typically one roll for a whole barrage of attacks), the enemy messing up, or shots just bouncing off of armor in general. There's also the case where you take the attack's harm, but explain not dying to it by saying you deflected it (usually necessary when it comes to firebending).<br/><br/>I just have some ideas in general now, so hopefully I'll have something written soon! I feel properly equipped to re-tackle the benders now - the Airbender needs re-writing, the Firebender is still quite good actually, the Waterbender is okay with what they have, but need more to fill in the stuff getting pulled away to sub-playbooks, and the earthbender could use some re-thinking but is generally okay.<br/>For reference:<br/>Korra - Waterbender (but as an Avatar she doesn't fit nicely into the rules)<br/>Bolin - Earthbender<br/>Mako - Firebender<br/>Asami - I'm not totally sure. Scholar, Aristocrat, or Ninja all kinda fit. The Driver is probably gonna be a new Scholar sub-playbook, so I guess she'd be that.<br/>Tenzin - Monk who took Airbending<br/>Lin - Earthbender-Metalbender.<br/>Tarlokk - Aristocrat with Waterbending<br/>All 3 of Tenzin's kids - Airbender<br/>Amon - Primarily an Aristocrat<br/>The Lieutenant (and all the Equalist minions) - Ninja<br/>Hiroshi - Scholar<br/><br/>The big thing is we have pretty much no one whose deal is straight-up toe-to-toe fighting without bending, aka I didn't see any blatant Samurais. It could be argued though that The Lieutenant wasn't really a ninja himself though, but a pretty mobile samurai.<br/><br/>All in all, good stuff. Loved the show, though not <i>quite</i> to the level I loved AtLAB for non-quality-related reasons.

Maybe something akin to:<br/>Water shielding: When you are the target of an attack, spend 1 chi and 1 water to gain 2 armour (Considering the bending playbooks wear little to none?)<br/>The other really odd thing I see a few waterbenders do is impose tags on themselves when they bend too, like the Octopus form trick, the waterspouts, or that dome-y thing that Tarrlok does (That is then combined with icebending and streaming when he chooses to make an attack). Maybe it could just be an additional option to the basic move, or would it be a more out-there environmental tag (Cloaked in water or 'Waterspout')<br/>I'm excited by the idea of a weatherdancer... And rewatching LoK from a different standpoint makes me think a pro-bender cross-playbook could be a funky addition if I could just tease out one more move than what I have in my head...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410345/#Comment_410345" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T20:35:35+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  8:35PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!<br/><br/>I'll loop back to water shielding in a sec cuz I want to talk about the second one. You're absolutely right about those neat moves that seem to put tags on themselves like the Waterspouts or the Octopus. However, that creates a situation that hadn't existed before: the positive Tag. Unlike Conditions, which in themselves have a negative connotation, the word Tag is neutral. However, the way I've been using Tags has been in an exclusively negative fashion.<br/>I've got two main options: I can re-organize the way the system works to try and figure out a use for positive tags, which could work but might be a bit weird since none of the existing moves reference tagging oneself. The other option is to just treat the action as a benefit of some kind, either something wholly original or something along the lines of the benefits granted by Move With Intention. Doing as a crazy environmental tag might be fun as well.<br/><br/>Reflexive/deflecting powers are exactly what I need, and what I felt I was missing after watching LoK (and I even moreso think I need something along those lines in the Airbender as well). I actually have a bunch of options for where to run with this!<br/>* I could take it down the path you suggested, which is cool. Heck, I'm not opposed to making it 1 Chi OR 1 Water (esp. since Water is really scarce), but I'd think that over a bit more before locking it in.<br/>* I could go super-simple with it and make it the ability to Stand Fast with Fluid if it's waterbending. On the one hand, this is very simple and easy to understand, plus I've made surprisingly few "Basic Move With Another Stat" moves. On the other hand, I also find this sort of move to be a bit of a crutch since they're really simple to come up with and aren't always the most interesting, but I think this one makes sense in context.<br/>* I could make it an expansion of an existing basic move, either MWI or SF. I like this option least.<br/>************<br/>Okay, coming back after a bit I have more thoughts about the set-ups for Waterbending.<br/>"When you set up a waterbending stance, spend 1 Water and roll Move With Intention. On a 10+, you may choose to forgo your usual choices to make your next Waterbending roll an automatic 10. Similarly, on a 7-9, you may forgo your usual choice to use the number you roll when you next Waterbed or a 7, whichever is greater."<br/>Essentially, the idea here is that your set-up lets you guarantee better waterbending later. Usually, the Octopus Form and the Waterspout and the Dome and such are typically a little offense-minded. I'm not SURE about making you spend Water - logically it makes sense, but it doesn't feel very balance-minded since you're gonna have to spend for the Waterbending anyway.<br/><br/>Actually, you've read my mind a bit - the pro-bender has been kicking around my mind for a couple days now. I don't have any moves laid out yet, and not too many ideas actually, just the idea that it would make for a good cross-Playbook sub. What kinda ideas do you have for the moves?<br/>But seriously, these are good ideas. I have a spare move-slot already on the playbook cuz Water is only barely a move (and could use a better name...), and at least one of these will surely make it in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410443/#Comment_410443" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T01:14:59+00:00" title="March 26, 2013  1:14AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2013 1:47AM by James_Fleming.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I quite like the stance write-up you have, currently. It keeps it flexible enough that it could be used for all sorts of 'big' waterbending, too.<br/><br/>With the Pro-Bender, I feel like what it really needs to emphasise is the MMA inspiration, the martial mix and unconventional styles they use, but also that shorter, sharper fashion of bending. I'll do a bit of a write up and edit it in here in a second.<br/>Bending armour: Maybe a 1 armour, comes with the class thing?<br/><br/>Grounded Stance: You may stand fast with your Bending roll.<br/><br/>Looks like a boring one at first glance, but has the weird effect of using the bending roll, rather than just basing it off another stat entirely, and so if you have niche bonuses to bending rolls from something, they add in. Either way, the most boring move in here.<br/><br/>Team-play: Take a move from another bending playbook. Where it references the style of bending within that playbook, change it to your form.<br/>This is... weird. I wasn't sure how you were going to run with bending exclusivity and that (Are benders allowed to take moves from other bending playbooks?) but the way that the two Fire Ferret brothers fight, it really seems like they grasp a lot of what they other is doing, and it has really bled into eachother's fighting forms.<br/><br/>Training Drills: When an ally takes advantage of a tag you imposed, they may change that tag to another tag of their desire.<br/><br/>Another kinda funky one, meant to represent the one-two punches so common in pro-bending. The other options were to make it a simple +1 harm, or a clone of the Kyoshi Chi phrase, but I thought both of these were less interesting.<br/>The way that it is intended to work is to convert say a 'dazed' or 'flat footed' into a 'prone' or other condition that makes sense as an escalation from the point of the fiction.<br/><br/>Another idea I had but rejected allowed you to switch the stat you made your basic bending from. I dunno how that would work in play though, and is likely to have some awkward side-effects, especially where sub-styles are concerned. The other was to have the same moves with variations depending on what your core bending style was, but I wasn't sure whether it would be too confusing.<br/><br/>***<br/>With regards to the stances, just thinking that many of them seem to have very distinct flaws (The immobility of Octopus or the vulnerability of snake, for example)... Was thinking how to fictionally characterise that. Would they be tags imposed later by a foe? Or maybe tags you impose on yourself to get a benefit?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410523/#Comment_410523" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T02:26:46+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  2:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet, glad my instinct was good on that one!<br/>You're right about the vulnerability thing though. To stick with the initial draft here, I'd just say those are things the enemy could tag you with since they make narrative sense. For a potentially less-powerful but still interesting alternate take on stances:<br/>"When you set up a waterbending stance, spend 1 Water. Until you leave the stance, you take +1 to Waterbending rolls, but have a Tag appropriate to the stance."<br/>Not quite enough to set up an instant success on a Waterbend, but a lot less stress on the power level of the game, and it covers the weakness. I'm still kinda partial to the first one, but a combination of the two in some way could be interesting. This is also less risky - there's no roll to mess up.<br/><br/>I def. agree with the emphasis on the martial style + unconventional methods of traditional bending, though I confess that personally I found the restrictions of pro-bending a little strangling on the show since it didn't let them always use the full potential of some of their elements. It was logical, but with the total absence of mono-element bending duels they didn't scratch that itch. That's show commentary though.<br/><br/>Bending Armour: Actually, this one is kinda boring to me. Sensible and mechanically a good idea, but just less interesting to me.<br/><br/>Grounded Stance: Woah, that's probably gonna need one hell of a fictional trigger. I don't have that many things that immediately trigger on using your Bending though, so it doesn't do much more than let you use your good stat.<br/><br/>Team-Play: The idea of Bending Exclusivity has plagued me basically from day one. The way I've built a lot of bender moves, they'd be really hard to make compatible with the others (such as needing Water tokens, or things keying off Momentum). <br/>I'm really liking the idea of this, but am quite struggling with how I can manifest it within the rules. This is one of the ones I had a relative of in my own mind, but I've gotten no further in making it actually work. Will come back on this one.<br/><br/>Training Drills: YES. With the brief addendum of "(within narrative sense)" but yeah, that's pretty great. Though I'll toss out that cloning the Kyoshi phrase actually isn't problematic, since (as an actual named Avatar thing rather than a generic thing) it's not core. Plus, Samurais and Ninjas (the playbooks that can become Kyoshi) can't take Pro-Bender anyway so it would just be opening up the move to more people really. But what you came up with is even better.<br/><br/>Yeah, swapping your basic bending form's stat would never get used. I'm of the mind to limit admission to primary Benders (rather than, say, a Scholar who took Firebending), since if bending isn't your main schtick, pro-bending certainly isn't gonna be your main schtick - at least, not as a player. And if we're just using primary benders, well, they're already using their high stats to bend.<br/><br/>Here's another wrench in pro-bending: a world with a complete airbender population. Can they play? Do we even LET them take the pro-bender sub-playbook (the answer to that one is "yes")?<br/><br/>Something I don't remember from the show was if there was any "playing the crowd" going on. Is there a move in that, in playing up the audience? How about a move about having a reputation as a team?<br/>If you have it, take a peek at The Spectacle custom playbook for Apocalypse World, it's essentially a Gladiator. While they're a little more violent-for-show than sportsman (as is befitting of ApW), it might have some ideas you like.<br/>(if you don't have it, I could toss it to you if you like)<br/>Sweet stuff overall.

For a start, Last Story is a revival of everything you love about JRPGs if you have the same problem with JRPGs that I have (Frustrating characterisations and limp predictable plots) largely because it is basically the team that made all the awesome Final Fantasies that left when Square and Enix merged reuniting and being awesome together again. If you liked 2, 4 and 9 you'll like it. Also not sure about whether you can get it on Netflix or Hulu, but if you liked GitS and Eden of the East, try Eve no Jikan. Bit more of a 'Children of Aasimov' vibe and a lot less action, but really explores how robotic technology affects the life of regular folks.<br/>And now onto the RPG stuff.~<br/>Energy Pathways is interesting... You make a good point about it begging ot to be combo'd with the Ninja, but I can't quite think of a way to avoid it, asides from just specifically stating it, which seems... Unfair. Especially since 'Contemplative spiritual ninja' is a fairly common archetype.<br/>The thing that leaps out at me with Stillness is carrying one forward. It seems to me that those moments of calm focus always lead into something superspecialcrazy awesome, which is what Carryng forward is meant to be... So maybe it auto picks that, and then allows you to pick from the list in addition?<br/>Clarity of Thought: I think this could be another weird and neat Chi manipulator, maybe making their own keys more flexible? Giving them the ability to add a temporary key for a scene, like an 'I know this needs to be done' kind of thing.<br/>I also think a neat idea might be to give them an ability where they can ask about other's Keys using Observe Carefully. It seems like that could be a good Monk schtick that, rather than looking at the 'Why' that they are doing it, going beyond to find the core motivation that leads them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412382/#Comment_412382" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-21T16:08:38+00:00" title="April 21, 2013  4:08PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I don't even just mean the things that are widely criticized in the JRPG genre - even the generally positive parts just don't really line up with the way I like to play games. I  guess I'll give a chance though once I get the cash.<br/>Also, from a loose Google search Eve no Jikan looks really interesting - that one's gonna be checked out once I get home.<br/><br/>The best way I can see Energy Pathways getting around the synergy with the Ninja is to make it cost 1 Chi ANY time you want to reorganize the group's Chi - from you to friends, from friends to you, from friends to other friends, starting any reorganization would cost 1 Chi. This doesn't entirely alleviate the issue, but it means that it gets costly to yank all of the Chi on a regular basis. It also would probably simplify the wording:<br/><b>Energy Pathways:</b> When you touch other characters, you may spend 1 Chi to redistribute all touched character's Chi to any other characters in whatever way you please.<br/>Terrifying thought: this as a violent technique used in PvP to deprive your friends. Maybe I add a line about "with the permission of the player" or some such to cover that, but I'm at the same time intrigued by the his ability to do it against others' wills.<br/><br/>Yeah, carrying forward is good thought for Stillness. Gotta find a nice way to word it, but that seems like the right path to follow.<br/>And I like that idea about Clarity of Thought! Messing around with their Chi Keys is a totally cool thing. Maybe it's something about "When you Meditate, you may alter your Chi Keys based upon the result of the roll. On a 10+, you may rewrite one of your keys temporarily[!] to whatever you want. On a 7-9, you may temporarily change one of your keys to be the same as another character's."<br/>Or something. The problem in there is that I can't just say temporarily, but I'm not sure about measuring the game in terms of scenes - that hasn't been a unit of measurement in the past, and that could be confusing.  It's a cool idea that I want to explore a little more though.<br/><br/>Asking about other Keys could be neat. It's basically just character-building to ask why they are that way, and it might be a bit of putting people on the spot, but I think that'll be okay.<br/><br/>FORUM PREVIEW!<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b330/maxdxam/Plantbender_vector_sized_trans_textured_zpsd964f9b0.png"/><br/>Plantbender image.

More Avatar World~<br/>The Monk for the most part looks pretty solid. The only two things I'd maybe flag are Calm Stability and Rivers of Energy, because they are really very powerful, but you likely know that already. Having +3 Solid basically makes you for all intents and purposes invincible when it comes to combat. It isn't a problem with the Monk itself, due to the general lack of offensive punch to the playbook, but if another playbook were to poach it as their additional move, it could make for a very imbalanced member of the party. I think it'd be better if a resurce of some sort was spent in the process (Maybe chi, representing the effort to stay calm and unflinching in the face of everything?), which would also make sense in the case of the Monk as this slow-burning Chi user who becomes quite weak when he is tapped out.<br/>Rivers of Energy I really think needs that permission clause. Otherwise the move is effectively Chi blocking but better in every way. Alternatively, a 'takes time' clause (Such that maybe the monk could drag the energy out of an imprisoned/supressed individual) would be pretty cool if you also wanted that more offensive use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416337/#Comment_416337" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T02:56:33+00:00" title="June 15, 2013  2:56AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/> Thanks!<br/>Definitely see your point on both. I knew Rivers of Energy was powerful as hell, and I guess yeah, some cost should come with it. Ooh, ooh, just had the thought that instead of a straight permission clause, you could burn away your Honor with someone to extract their Chi! Then it's not stepping on the toes of Chi Blockers completely, but still keeps some offensive capability. And I don't know if it came through in the text, but as clarification, you can't reconfigure with NPCs since those characters don't have their own independent Chi sources, just the MC as a whole (and touching an NPC to drain away the MCs whole stash would be totally absurd).<br/>Also, it would be better in every way than Chi Blocking if that's quite how I was working with Chi Blocking. As I have it write now, Chi Blocking with the Ninja doesn't stop them from spending Chi, but you use your own Chi to stop them doing almost anything. I totally had to go look that up though cuz the name is a little deceptive (and probably why I ended up not calling the move "Chi Blocking").<br/><br/>I HADN'T remembered that Calm Stability could be taken by other playbooks though! I'd been thinking, yeah, strong, but the Monk doesn't have a ton he can do back, but you're totally right that cross-playbooking it would be crazy.<br/>Calm Stability was my revised version of the older Chi Armor, which essentially just let you drain away harm coming at you by burning Chi, which wasn't so crazy for a guy who doesn't generate Chi like the Monk can. I changed it because I thought Chi Armor was a little complex, and I wanted to write it as a move since I didn't have many of those in the Monk. Definitely gonna see how I can do that - I'm not so sure I want to just add a small Chi cost (since I think I may be leaning on that as a bit of a design crutch lately), but maybe.<br/>Looking back, I have another nigh-invincibility move on the Samurai that could use some revision in that case. Earthbenders would have a field day with either of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416812/#Comment_416812" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-22T01:47:57+00:00" title="June 22, 2013  1:47AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, haven't gone back to fix the little issues in the Monk yet, but yesterday while in the car with some friends I wrote the whole damn Aristocrat, and then I drew it and vector'd it up.<br/><a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/2013/06/avatar-world-art-aristocrat.html" rel="nofollow">HERE IS THAT POST</a><br/><br/>Every playbook is now written!

I asked a question about whether or not it's actually okay to use the terms Samurai and Ninja for my playbooks when technically that's not exactly what they're modelling. The names are based around our stereotype of the Samurai and Ninja, not necessarily the actual truth of the matter (though I've attempted to learn up on and integrate the truth). What it comes down to is that I'm modeling Avatar and martial arts films, in which that stereotype of the Samurai and the Ninja are fairly heavily ingrained. The things I'm trying to emulate are themselves appropriating and stereotype-enforcing, and I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to emulate those things without furthering the stereotype myself. It was pointed out that yes, Avatar never actually says the words Samurai or Ninja, but the other things I'm emulating definitely do.<br/>The most obvious solution is "rename the playbooks". However, I can't come up with anything else that's powerfully evocative. Of course, why are these names even evocative? If it's because of their "exotic"ness, that's actually a bad thing. Now, I'm pretty sure there's more than that to it, but still.<br/>Also, they're distinctly Japanese names for a game 90% based on a show that was all about Chinese mythology. <br/><br/>When it comes down to it, I'm debating what to do in a game based on archetypes when the archetypes of the genre support stereotypes. I want to do do it, but don't want to be part of the problem, but if I leave it out, am I really properly showing the genre?<br/><br/>Hard questions. Still working on an answer. Clyde and Troy helped, but I don't feel like I have the right solution yet.

Trying to apply it to other times and places feels weird. I have less of that feeling about "ninja" (which is weird, because I do have that feeling about other terms like "shinobi"), mostly because of the 90s obsession with ninjas that destroyed a lot of the specific cultural associations: Ninja Turtles, Three Ninjas, Surf Ninjas, etc. In both cases, though, I'm confused why you would have those in an Avatar-inspired game. Avatar doesn't have samurai or ninjas.<br/><br/>Also note, the 4 nations in Avatar are inspired by different real-world cultures or regions. The Water Tribe is mostly Inuit-inspired, the Earth Kingdom is mostly China-inspired, the Fire Nation is mostly Japan-inspired, and the Air Nomads are mostly Himalayan-inspired (i.e. Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, etc). There are exceptions to this, of course (like Kyoshi Island), but those parallels are important. The Fire Nation's naval fleet, expansionistic goals, and conquest of the Earth Kingdom is a WWII allegory, for example. The Earth Kingdom's secret police are named after a famous Chinese WWII spymaster: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai_Li" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai_Li</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418082/#Comment_418082" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-10T10:46:12+00:00" title="July 10, 2013 10:46AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup, I absolutely see what you're saying. The big jump I'm making that brings these issues toward the surface is that I'm not JUST modeling Avatar. I'm also trying to emulate wuxia and martial arts films with the same rules, and since my focus is on the action style of Avatar (rather than, say, the types of plot arc), the two coexist quite well. Also, using Samurai and Ninja but broadening the definition lets me cover a lot of the characters I had trouble fitting in.<br/>So yes, Avatar has no true Samurais or Ninjas. But my other source material does, and that's where most of the issue is coming from.<br/>Also definitely see what you're saying about "ninja" being less specific today because it's already been heavily adapted and alterred, while "samurai" is still very specific. As someonestill finding his feet with things, how specific of a vibe do you get off Ronin? If it's less (as I think many movies actually feature ronin rather than true samurai, and the effect could be similar to the ninja, though idk, that's why I'm asking), Ronin might actually be more accurate to the character archetype and what I've been describing anyway.<br/><br/>The 4 Nations are definitely their own cultural parallels. I think the world as a whole is given more of a Chinese vibe though (with spirits like the Moon and Ocean symbolizing a yin-yang pattern). You're right though, I can't let myself forget the parallels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418085/#Comment_418085" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-10T11:30:15+00:00" title="July 10, 2013 11:30AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FYI, the moon and the ocean are both strong yin/female elements, traditionally.

If you wanted to go for something more neutral, Wushi might be a nice middleground between getting across the setting's tone (Rather than going for something like 'Warrior' which feels a bit bland) and actually being an accurate word (In so much as it is merely warrior in Chinese, from the same root that we get Wuxia and Bushido, which both influenced the design). But Wushi is not a term used much in the English speaking world, and Samurai does in the West have a popular cultural image of "That dude who runs in and swallow cuts everything with an awesome katana". So in a sense it is a term that has, for the rights or wrongs of it, already been misappropriated, as similar things have happened with a number of European warrior terms (Cavalier, Paladin, etc.),<br/><br/>In trying to name a general class for all these cultures at once is where you encounter the problem. If it was a more Japanese setting, Samurai would actually probably be fine. Though it has cultural connotations, the term Knight is often used in a similar manner in the west despite the two being roughly analogous positions in the feudal systems under which they lived. With a more general term, though, you might feel like you lose some of the specificity of the setting.<br/><br/>The real problem here is that one of the settings you are drawing most heavily from, Avatar, itself drags a lot of inspiration from a lot of Asia and beyond, <br/>I think 'Agni Kai' is the best example here, being either a jumble of Sanskrit and Japanese (Fire Meeting), a legitimate fantastical Bengali word construction (Fire Argument) or a pun on a Bangladeshi sport (Agunali), depending on who you want to believe. So drawing too heavily from that source material there is probably going to result in some misappropriation. When faced with these decisions, check the etymology. Samurai means 'He who tends to the nobility'. If that fits what you want it to do, then use it. If not, maybe think more closely and use a different term.<br/><br/>On the other hand, with the breadth of the influences, one might question whether there IS a specificity to the source material. If you used something like Wushi, would it be fair to be used with the Inuit influenced fighters of the Water tribe? Considering that the setting is your own, drawing inspiration from a source material, it is also something that you can tailor to more directly suit the culture you are naming from. If it were me, I would be tempted to use a term for Warrior that fitted the angle that I was aiming for culturally, and use Martial Artist for the Ninja playbook.<br/><br/>(So basically I have just wasted a lot of your time by saying very little indeed)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419351/#Comment_419351" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T23:40:47+00:00" title="July 31, 2013 11:40PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...wait, my response to this didn't go through?

In particular, the name Wushi gets my mind running, but you're right that it's not a name the West is typically familiar with.<br/><br/>You're right about my issue being from Avatar being multi-sourced itself. Honestly though I think the Chinese flavor tends to stand through as the most prominent cultural influence (in my uneducated American opinion). <br/><br/>With some thinking, my general path is probably going to be to keep Ninja the same - I think that it's the best indicator of what I'm going for, and I think I'm allowing the possibilities of the playbook to be decently broad while still staying consistently true to the idea of "ninja". Samurai though will be replaced as a name - Warrior is very dull to me, but I'll find some replacement. Knight's not crazy actually; it's a rather broad idea to the modern eye, yet still talks about a heavily armored soldier tied into the nobility.<br/>********************<br/><br/>As a different thing (the thing I was coming here to post when I noticed my other post didn't go through), I did some work!

What sort of action?<br/><br/>I combined them.<br/><br/>There now exists only one playbook, The Warrior. 90% Ninja still, Samurai is a single move now, reading like this:<br/>"Samurai: You are trained in open combat, and may wear up to 2-armor (with the associated penalty). Being a Samurai comes with extra baggage: to whom have you sworn loyalty? Do you still feel loyal to them? Make an oath with yourself reflecting your commitment to them."<br/>I feel completely comfortable applying the word Samurai to that move - the move is very much in the spirit of the real thing I believe, and doesn't really generalize it. I don't think. Plus, just being a move name is a much more low-intensity label than having a whole playbook.<br/>And I swapped out Ambush (the most dangerously powerful move that, in the end, didn't add that much really anyway) to make room for Samurai, so win-win!<br/><br/>I had just kinda been thinking that the two seemed compatible. Really, the Samurai before was just a Ninja with some social moves instead. I think a complete "The Samurai" sub-playbook would be easier to make, wouldn't be center-stage, and would be much easier to keep very focused.<br/><br/>I could have kept the Ninja name, but I don't think it's even all that necessary. Warrior has been sounding better and better to me these past few days. Gonna have to redo the art, but I was going to anyway. The name I really wanted to put on the playbook was "The Swordmaster", but I didn't want to lock the only weapons-combat class into just swords. If there's any generic words along the lines of Swordmaster that apply more across the spectrum, I'd love to hear 'em. Although for reference, Martial Artist is out.<br/><br/>Mostly I just have the courage to do a big change like this because it was like 4am and I figured I'd just <i>do it</i>. The move I'm most saddened to be losing is Calm Reservation from the Samurai. I really liked how that move worked. Maybe it'll go in the sub-playbook, or I might try integrating it into the Aristocrat or even the Monk.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Monk, I played around with Calm Stability!<br/>"Calm Stability: Until you personally show aggression toward a foe (or their allies), whenever you are still and unflinching in the face of imminent harm, roll+Solid. On a 10+, the danger washes over you harmlessly. On a 7-9, you still come through unscathed except (choose one):<br/>     * the experience is painful (take 1 Harm) but you are unphazed.<br/>     * your resolve is broken, take the Tag Shaken. [I'm not big on this option]<br/>     * you can no longer stand by and immediately act against the target that attacked you. [I'm really big on this option]"<br/>And with the Samurai's "Untouchable" no longer in the game, I've removed two of three powerful armor moves, the last one being the Earthbender's Defender (which just always gives you 2-armor in contact with solid ground).<br/><br/>Here's an idea I had bouncing around: I haven't seen this done before, but applying a Keyword to a select set of moves. Namely, the Bending keyword (for the 4 main bendings) and the Bender-Only keyword, for moves that would only function if you have bending ability. The former is to corner off multiple-element benders, and the latter is a less-necessary tag that would make my life easier with regard to balance. Am I crazy? Is this at all a good idea?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420678/#Comment_420678" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-25T02:39:27+00:00" title="August 25, 2013  2:39AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, put it all in an official blog post.

They sit pretty well with the genre. I especially like Be Melodramatic. It reminds me of the similar principle from Feng Shui.

And some of you might know this if you read my Twitter or if you follow along on the blog other than when I post it here, but I have big news!<br/><br/>I PLAYED AVATAR WORLD!<br/><br/>Okay now let's decompress that a little. On Saturday I was sitting there after my Monsterhearts game and I realized that I was <i>this</i> close to a usable document, so I staked out the corner of Games on Demand with the pizza and started copy and pasting together a Word document with the stuff I needed to play. That night I printed it out.<br/>Sunday evening I finally had spare time so I put it on the GoD schedule and got four players together.<br/><br/>Here's the quick summary I wrote for the blog:<br/>We played in a world not-quite like the world of avatar, but quite similar. The four characters were Haa, a female airbender tired of monotonous life at the temple, Flamio, a poor teenaged Firebender who had accidentally burned down a bunch of the city years ago, and wants to be super famous, Kai, an older earthbender who has taken some responsibility for Flamio's wellbeing, and a nomadic Waterbender named Bokonnon who wants to claim a piece of land for his family (as the Water Tribe lives on an armada of ships). I don't think Eric realized I totally know where the name came from, as a huge Vonnegut fan. The game was in the capital during the Spirit Festival, which is ruled by the Phoenix King. I totally forgot that's what Ozai called himself! In this case the name was more about the immortality of the emperor rather than the fire. No one knows what bending he has, as rumors abound of all of them, but no one has ever spoken to someone who has personally seen him bend. His second, the Phoenix Prince, is an annually selected role based on a tournament to defeat the not-current but previous Prince, and is always a firebender. The group decided to go to the Holy Mountain to gain the treasure and fame from defeating the great beasts there and claiming the treasure, but they get lost and wind up in the festival, where Flamio is put into the tournament by Haa and he fights and defeats the older Prince. He is then publicly and personally addressed by the Phoenix King, a very rare event, to task him as the first Questing Prince in many, many years. He is to go and restore the balance of the Mountain, and re-establishing the Phoenix as the dominant spirit.<br/>There were a lot of flaws in the game! I have holes to fix up, but a LOT of the issues came from the way I presented everything. I need to learn to GM it better. the main thing is to come up with and even script the way I intro the game and build the world and stuff. I also need to examine the Basic Moves and figure out how to make them work for significant non-combat as well. A big one is I want is we tried a stealth-type thing and I should at least have some way of sneakily moving around inside of Move With Intention. A lot of the moves and most of the Oaths could use more support dictating what happens in the fiction - Robert thinks it would be better to narrow down a lot of the things into main categories rather than leaving them open-ended, and I'm inclined to agree. Also, the Airbender (which he was playing)'s moves could use some more direct link to the fiction.<br/>I definitely need to find a good way to explain Chi.<br/>Basically, huge learning experience, and everyone said it was really fun.<br/>I will not be making the PAX Edition document available immediately. I want to do a bit of repairs, and then compile it into something a bit more pretty than two dozen sheets of paper covered in plain-text Times New Roman. Soon though! The goal is still to have a full document around by the Gamerati Game Day on the 21st. <br/><br/>It felt good. I liked running it. Repairs must be made, but you know what?<br/><br/>I RAN AVATAR WORLD!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421516/#Comment_421516" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-14T21:49:24+00:00" title="September 14, 2013  9:49PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a swift update, I did the art for the Warrior playbook and give a preview of a bit of the playbook layout in a new post.<br/><a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/2013/09/avatar-world-art-warrior.html" rel="nofollow">HERE IS THAT POST</a><br/><br/>This is mostly just a stopover, you'll get a complete update on Friday or Saturday with the complete, usable PDF!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/legend-of-the-elements-final-3-days-of-the-kickstarter-help-make-the-last-stretch-goal-8-27" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/legend-of-the-elements-final-3-days-of-the-kickstarter-help-make-the-last-stretch-goal-8-27" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/legend-of-the-elements-final-3-days-of-the-kickstarter-help-make-the-last-stretch-goal-8-27/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/legend-of-the-elements-final-3-days-of-the-kickstarter-help-make-the-last-stretch-goal-8-27/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/legend-of-the-elements-final-3-days-of-the-kickstarter-help-make-the-last-stretch-goal-8-27/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/legend-of-the-elements-final-3-days-of-the-kickstarter-help-make-the-last-stretch-goal-8-27/p5">5</a><a class=" p-6 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/legend-of-the-elements-final-3-days-of-the-kickstarter-help-make-the-last-stretch-goal-8-27/p6">6</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17429/legend-of-the-elements-final-3-days-of-the-kickstarter-help-make-the-last-stretch-goal-8-27/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17429%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17429%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Legend of the Elements] Final 3 Days of the Kickstarter!

I haven't written new material as I wanted to do a couple of playtests to see how things were working, what I liked, what I didn't. I've now played three games with this ruleset. The first game, at PAX, I detailed above, and it exposed a number of things I didn't feel great about, but that was tempered by an unease with how I was running it as well. We had all four benders played.<br/>I wasn't able to play on the day I released it, but the following week I played in a game that someone else ran. I was The Aristocrat, and we also had a Waterbender and a Scholar (who was fairly monkish). It was excellent. Lots of really cool scenery and drama. I would totally watch this show.<br/>I played again at Technicolor Dreams on Saturday. I ran the game for two people (Jess and stupidgremlin - thanks so much for the kind words man, I had a great time as well!); fewer than I recommend, but it worked better than I would have expected. For this game, I ran the con scenario in the love letters, The Red Mountain. It was awesome. I know I set up The Red Mountain to highlight what I like personally, but I think they felt it pretty excellent too. This one was more movie-style, and definitely ended concretely. We had a Scholar and an Earthbender, and the Scholar basically ended up becoming the Owl from the episode The Library (library included!), and the Earthbender was given the power of dragons to forever watch over the gate, with Sel banished. It was cool with some great encounters, and some definite dramatic stuff. I would totally run the game with the scenario again. I also felt much better about the way we ran the game. It's easier to bind two characters together in a group than four, but I think it wouldn't have been too hard even with more.<br/><br/>So what did I learn about the rules? Well, here's the biggest things: Managing Chi feels a tad fiddly, especially any MC chi. Tags are significantly uncommon and only keying the Chi off of them makes it a rare thing. Reorganizing that system is top priority. An idea tossed around after the first game and tossed around to a much larger degree after the second game (they shared a person, Robert was a player in the first and ran the second) was the idea of bringing in a larger role for the Chakras. Specifically, people were interested in the idea of the Chakras in play butting up against each other, not in an antagonistic way but in that bickering way, were people get upset with each other and stay angry for a bit but then reconcile, which was more or less a constant thing in the show.<br/>I need to re-write oaths. The general system feels decent; but the specific oaths need fine-tuning to more properly set-up a dramatic situation with good relations. Some parts need more structure, some just need more focused stuff.<br/>So far, the most popular playbooks are the Scholar (2 games, both times the reading type), the Waterbender, and the Earthbender.<br/>The Waterbender was generally fine, but I think I ought to redraw the actual playbook layout a bit on the moves sheet to make the Water pool very clear.<br/>The Scholar was also generally fine, with both players choosing the Large Book For Bludgeoning and being really creative with it, which is awesome. I'd make it the only option, but it can add some silliness to the game, and not necessarily everyone who wants to play a scholar wants to be silly. (plus the inventor-type wouldn't have as obvious a reason for the book). The thing that popped out at me about the Scholar was that I had to manually explain the idea of "Always Prepared" to both people, so I'm gonna go in and see if I can't streamline the phrasing any.<br/>The Earthbender worked great, with the existing issue that Earthbending (the move) isn't always a great supporter of the player in returning the result to the fiction, mostly because Earthbending is so broad in scope. I'm considering narrowing it, and leaning hard on the idea that bending moves don't always trigger when you just bend element, sometimes the thing you're doing is more like one of the basic moves. That's a potential direction, we'll see if I actually make anything of that.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm unbelievably happy so far. Nothing has mechanically cracked and shattered in play, I don't seem to have any gaping holes, and play is fun and exciting. Robert seemed to not have any obvious trouble running it, or at least none he brought up, but he's also a very experienced MC. I'm just really excited about how everything has been going. If anyone is interested in doing a game over G+ or something, I'd be up for running a round sometime. Otherwise, let me know if you play it yourself, or find me at cons - I can't say no to running the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming" title="James_Fleming"><img alt="James_Fleming" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">James_Fleming</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423577/#Comment_423577" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-31T15:33:11+00:00" title="October 31, 2013  3:33PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks great in final form.

And there's a new version due out in a couple days as soon as I burn through all this darn layout. I didn't built the playbooks with re-organizing the entire layout in mind, which I need to do thanks to completely forgetting to label harm on the sheets.<br/>And no problem! I wasn't exaggerating - your interest and feedback was what kept me engaged with my own project for a while there, and I probably would have dropped it.<br/><br/>The new update isn't just cosmetic (although I've got a couple little things to change on that front, including a gorgeous front-page title image by stupidgremlin). While a full post is still waiting on the layout stuff, I've been spoiling it already on Twitter so here's the broad strokes:<br/>* In light of the uninteresting and infrequent interactions with the Chi mechanic I'm changing the mechanism completely. It is generated in a new way, and it's more powerful. Oh, and it's also your XP, so there's a trade-off of using it.<br/>* PCs no longer deal harm. Actions Tag foes, and the severity is basically just limited by the fictional situation of the moment, so Commit Open Violence will rarely be inflicting the same types of Tags as Move With Intention. Taking down foes is just a matter of putting an appropriately incapacitating Tag on them, which means fictionally positioning into a good place to do that. Also, as long as the MC doesn't treat the NPCs with kid gloves (as per the Principle) it shouldn't be all that tough to put down your average NPC.<br/>* MC Chi is completely different (COMPLETELY) and, uh, is focused on an interaction with a system I haven't designed yet. Whoops. It shouldn't be a huge deal in the one-shots that get done between the new update and writing that system (spoilers, it's Plots, which are basically Fronts).<br/>The post itself will have more details, of course.<br/><br/>There might be a playtest session in Olympia next week that Robert's running that I don't think I'll be in (running ApW at someone's request), and I'm in scheduling for another playtest with a group of Tacoma folks. And my home group will play it one of these days, I swear.<br/><br/>Oh, and cuz I didn't come here to mention it, if anyone was one of the small percentage of people who, for whatever reason, found the Zip file of Avatar World to be corrupted, on the release page there's a new link where you can download the individual files direct. Sorry for the inconvenience, I have no idea what's causing that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Killy" title="Killy"><img alt="Killy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/669/nBHMHULXQGKOR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Killy">Killy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423656/#Comment_423656" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T17:48:19+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  5:48PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are the Chi and Tag changes currently live and available to us?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423657/#Comment_423657" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-02T18:00:33+00:00" title="November  2, 2013  6:00PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They weren't, as I was working on putting together this damn layout stuff (I didn't build the original playbooks with rearranging elements in mind), but hell, I'm eager to share, so have some changes!

Is this intentional?<br/><br/>Looking at AW, the straight stat advancements tend to cap at max +2, with generally an ungiven future or playbook move advance required for +3.  Did you change to a +3 cap deliberately?<br/><br/>Reason I ask is that several (the Bender?) books have a move that advances a stat, often conditionally, up to +3.  Except for the ability to start with a +3 in a key stat at character generation, these are at present strictly speaking inferior to the attribute advancements available to all- and you don't have to use one of your own Playbook move advances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423963/#Comment_423963" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-08T10:28:55+00:00" title="November  8, 2013 10:28AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that some of the games (Monster of the Week comes to mind) implement the +3 cap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423972/#Comment_423972" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-08T12:22:58+00:00" title="November  8, 2013 12:22PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Cneph">@Cneph</a><br/><br/>That's a good point about advancement efficiency.

Honestly I didn't even notice that those locked off at +2 in ApW's improvements - I have more experience with the moves, and those said (max+3) and I guess I kinda ssumed that was throughout. Gonna think about dropping it to +2 then, as that would make the moves more enticing. And yeah, the Benders and the Scholar are the ones with the +1 Stat moves.<br/>(on the other hand, those moves may not stick around, as I still question their value as fiction-supporters).<br/><br/>Thanks though, I totally hadn't picked up on that! I'll probably drop the advancement cap to +2.<br/><br/>*******<br/>I played a game of AvW last night, again run by Robert. It was very different in tone than usual - a lot darker, a lot more violent, not like a kid's show at all, though kinda keeping in line with some other fighting media. It had super-crazy Spirits and creatures and stuff though, which is what I'm in for; some examples included Void Wave, the Warrior's naginata-type spear, my Monk's patron spirit the jaguar-moth, and rubber-suited industrial firebenders with gas masks that had rotating clicking shutters over the eyes. It was awesome. We decided at the end that we should probably do a quick tone discussion beforehand or maybe address it in the text that it's quite variable in tone when many people assume first the light-heartedness of Avatar (while I'm often interested in some of the darker elements, hence why Siege of the North is my favorite episode - between Ko and Aang's interface with the Ocean spirit, it got intense and kinda scary for Avatar).<br/>The Chi flowed a lot smoother with the new system, but folks mentioned that an automatic 7-9 didn't really entice them so much cuz they didn't mind the risk and the use as XP was more valuable to them. Of course, this group wasn't the sort to try to avoid failure, so I'm not changing it until it sees a little more play.<br/>Two other things popped up. First was that it would be cool to have some structure under the setup, as in why the party is together and such. The Party scene from Anima Prime was mentioned, so I'm gonna check that out. Unlike ApW/MH, where proximity to each other is assumed, many Avatar-type media is more about a diverse and wide-ranging group, so putting people together can be tough, and that bit of structure would come BEFORE character creation.<br/>The other thing is that while I'm still satisfied with the basic structure of Oaths, I want to do some rewriting of starting oaths and rewrite the oath resolution moves, as I think breaking an oath maybe shouldn't be a bad thing but simply a different path of evolution.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the next couple games.

In my Sprawl game, while occasionally this player or that player would want us to all be together when we weren't ... it worked out really well having us all doing different but interlocking things some of the time. Made the world feel that much bigger. That said, The Sprawl sort of allows for both modes of play fairly easily--you don't necessarily form connections directly to the other players but work with them on various jobs against collectively created corporations. It's like the FATE adventure+co-starring system only while there's at LEAST one co-star, any other players can hop in and say they were part of the mission too. You can take these collaborations however you want as we go around the table and flesh it out. Were you close? How much did you know? Is this your first time working together?<br/><br/>That's more the MC's way of handling it, though, than anything else. As a player I've been happiest when the MC pushes those questions as we go around for HX and such. It's nice to have some connection between your players, but I don't see why Oaths can't do a substantial part of that for you or perhaps even all of it! I think if a group wants tighter connections, that's not necessarily an issue with the system as written. It's either an issue with the system as played, or just something the particular mix of players needs to do to feel at home in the system and the world. Remember, in vanilla Apocalypse World your first session is supposed to <i>make</i> some of this happen by going around and exploring everyone's lives. Asking them what they're up to, where they are. They can make associations with the other PCs here, flesh out pre-made associations, or leave the ball in your court as you explore their lives and inevitably build up ammo in the form of potential fronts and threats and such that can cause the players to collide in one way or another. There's nothing wrong with shifting some of that work into explicit before-play prep and for most playgroups at least some of it HAS to happen before hand ... I'm mostly just making the case that it's not necessarily something missing from the <i>system</i> you're making.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423982/#Comment_423982" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-08T14:45:49+00:00" title="November  8, 2013  2:45PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/antisinecurist">@antisinecurist</a>: Yeah, that was kinda what was suggested - the quite-bold "bump you move up one step, from 6- to 7-9 or 7-9 to 10". I was resistant when it was first said, but the more I sit on it the more I'm kinda into it. It's incremental, it's desirable (I don't think it's controversial at all that you'd want it), it still has that balance of "worse outcome but keep the Chi for other things e.g. improvement, or better with consequences later", and it's still a very simple mechanic that doesn't take much time.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/gwathdring">@gwathdring</a>: I totally agree with regard to closeness questions - the big issue is getting the party in the same general location in the first place! Even if they barely know each other, to have meaningful character interaction they have to at least be in the same place.<br/>But I totally see what you mean. I think this issue is being inflated by the fact that I've only done 1-shots, where getting people in the same place quickly is vital to the game. That's what makes the love letters in the zip work well, it bypasses the "why are we here right now" and lets us focus on "how are we connected to each other".<br/>And I definitely am overstating this as an "issue". It's totally functional as-is. It's more investigating what's OPTIMAL.

You're 100% right that I need some text to support how Tags work. Here, I'll try to explain what my intention is here, because it's going to take some serious thought to figure out how to really communicate this concisely in the text.<br/><br/>The tricky bit is that, with regard to other <i>mechanics</i>, they don't hold much weight. Their power is in the fiction. The trick is that there isn't a defined "taken-out" so much as characters are taken out of the fight when their Tags would determine that they can't fight any more. Commit Open Violence should be clarified that you still add a Tag on a 7-9, though if you choose "you inflict little harm" the Tag shouldn't be about directly damaging their body.<br/>To break that out into some examples, there's a Warrior and a Monk, on a ship in the middle of a thick fog with the rest of the gang when pirates grapple up from some small motorboats. The Monk sweeps off his cloak, patterned with the eye spots of the jaguar-moth, and Moves With Intention to throw his cloak up into the air in front of the pirates, fluttering in the wind, its eye spots frightening in the fog, applying the "Distracted" tag.<br/>That Tag is more for set-up. It's not meant to cause anyone harm so much as set them up for future difficulty.<br/>Continuing, the Warrior grabs some rigging ropes off the deck and swings them around, looping it around a pair of guys, Moving With Intention. The Tag he chose to put on the guys was "Wrapped Up."<br/>This Tag was taking a guy out of a fight for the most part. Other action could put them back in the fight, such as if everything else takes a while, but for now they're out.<br/>As the fight moved on, the Warrior had been knocked from the deck. Springing back up to the edge of the deck with the help of the Airbender (present but not relevant to this anecdote), he vaults back into the fight, drawing his naginata-like spear Void Wave from its pocket dimension and shoving it at some pirates, Committing Open Violence. He succeeds and, with a quick confirmation with the GM that it's cool to apply this tag, declares them "Dead."<br/>No doubt, that Tag took people out. Much of the time, Dead is a bit strong for a Tag - Stabbed Through The Gut, or Mortally Wounded are probably better, but this was a particularly nasty game and just slaughtering some mooks sounded right. No kid gloves, Void Wave through the belly is dead.<br/><br/>That example actually happened earlier this month! That's a slightly edited version to keep it focused on how Tags can be applied in a fight, such as writing out the Firebender and Airbender, but it's mostly accurate still.<br/>The idea I'm trying to communicate is that Taken-Out is not its own distinction. If a Tag would be enough to take someone out of the fight, they're out. It wouldn't be crazy to declare those Wrapped Up guys as taken out, but they might actually be back later if the fiction made it seem proper.<br/><br/>The difference with Titan World (which is pretty cool and I hadn't seen it, so thanks!) would be that there's <i>one</i> way to take out your foes in Attack on Titan: slaughter. Straight-up murder of titans. There's no way to get rid of Titans that doesn't end in a blood-bath, and that's appropriate to that setting. That frees up Titan World to have a move dedicated to taking out Titans. Unfortunately, I don't think Avatar World could accommodate a similar system with a move to very clearly "take out" foes, as there's so many ways a character can be taken out, many of which are impermanent if left alone.<br/>I definitely understand what you're saying about the rather nebulous nature of how that really works. The best way I can explain it right now I think is just as following the fiction: the Tags you can deal are sourced from what you're doing in the fiction, and the effects of those Tags are bound to the fiction. I hope this makes it clear how I intend for that to happen, and I hope that's really how it runs in play.<br/><br/>As for the other points:<br/>* The harm scale is something I should write! Your average soldier if he jabs you proper-like with a spear probably deals around 3 harm, a Master Firebender could probably deal about 4 harm with a great hit, with the addition that the harm ignores armor. I still need to actually write that scale - before, the general weapon damages you had gave a rough indicator, so without them there's no real metric for what "1-harm" or "5-harm" might mean besides 1/6 or 5/6 of your total energy, and that's forgetfulness on my part. I'll totally try to include that in the MC section of v1.2, thanks for bringing this to my attention!<br/>* Healing is similarly bound mostly to the fiction. ApW-powered games typically don't have much about healing your harm, and that it generally just goes away with time and medical care as seems appropriate. The only healing factor in v1.1 is in the Waterbender, though I have an intended Doctor sub-playbook for the Scholar (who may gain the sub-playbook's main move if I feel like changing the Scholar). Hmm, kinda having subtle thoughts about how Healing is a desirable thing and how that might relate to Chi, though I'm pretty sure I don't want to complicate things like that...<br/>Anyway, the big takeaway with both of these is that the fiction is king. If you take enough time off or caring for yourself that your wounds-as-established would be fixed, at least partially, that would reduce your harm.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm copping out of the questions by pointing back and saying that solution is just to go by what makes sense in the fiction, but I hope no one takes it that way. But I think looking back to the fiction is both mechanically the simplest method and allows the story to flow well. In Tag placement, it DOES become a little bit of a player skill to try to put Tags that sounds powerful or interesting on foes, but I'd just keep in mind that Tags needn't be pithy or tight the way, say, FATE aspects ought to be. You can have "Distracted By A Cloak In The Fog" as a Tag, even though it's literally just straight description. Ultimately, I think it's up to the MC to see when you're overstepping the bounds of what you could reasonably do with a move, but they're your fan by principle, so they're not going to be looking for how to screw you over or dumb stuff like that.<br/>Of course, most of this is theory. I have experience with one game of this system, and I think it worked out well (enough so that I could use it to illustrate the concept), but I'll need a bit more experience with it see if it consistently plays out like this.<br/><br/>I've babbled on long enough.

Now, keep this in mind: the principles and moves are there so that other people can play the game the way you've designed it. The fact that you're codifying the style you want to play it in is a very good thing; it'll help other people to play off of that. For instance, "be melodramatic"--that's a great principle! It's going to drive a large portion of the action.<br/><br/><i>"Third, you don't want it to seem like you're using moves!"</i><br/><br/>I'd suggest a slight tweak to this bit. It might be nitpicking, but I'd change "seem" to "feel", and here's why: "seem" implies that you're trying to hide the fact that you're making a move. That makes the process of GM moves something shrouded in obfuscation. When I play a *World game, I instinctively know when the MC just sprung a move, but it doesn't distract me. What you want to avoid is drawing undue attention to the move. That's why you don't say the name, because saying its name isolates the players from the action. It should <i>feel</i> like it's just another part of the action, but I wouldn't say you have to go to lengths to conceal it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425807/#Comment_425807" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-14T20:57:20+00:00" title="December 14, 2013  8:57PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good catch, I totally agree.

In fact it was pretty much useless as far as real design goes. My winter break instead consisted of copious and excessive amounts of Assassin's Creed IV which, while very fun, was not very helpful in the long run.<br/><br/>My goal for Version 1.2 is mutli-fold.<br/>* I want to include at least 1 piece of art. That means I need to make a piece of art. That means I have to pick a damn art style.<br/>* I want to make the layout look not super-basic. I'd like it to look pretty. This might come in a later version.<br/>* I want to add in the Principles/Moves re-writes, as well as further explain Tags.<br/>* I want to amend the goof-ups and little things, such as the Samurai move still having that line about the Tag for your armor that doesn't exist anymore and the messed up stat-line, as well as altering the Chi mechanic to make spending a bump up (from 6- to 7-9 or 7-9 to 10+) after the roll instead of an auto 7-9. More tempting that way. I'm not 100% on the change, but I'm more than 50% so it'll change and just revert if it doesn't work.<br/><br/>* Speaking of not working, the Honor and Oaths subsystem right now is the last remaining <i>major</i> hurdle. It works, but not really how I want it to. It's big and space-consuming and complicated and inelegant and, most importantly, <i>it barely gets interacted with.</i> Part of this is all my experience is 1-shot experience. There are two parts to the Oaths/Honor rewrite: part one is to overhaul the whole system and try to make it do what I want, part two is rewriting the specific starting oaths. Part two can be put off til the next version, but I want to get part one done.<br/>Problem: I'm not entirely sure what I even want it to do. And even if I did, I'm kinda dry right now on smart tricks of how to not just clone Hx.<br/><br/>So I have a lot of stuff to get to work on, and little idea of how to do it. I could use some ideas to kickstart things. Heck, even if it's just pointing me at other hacks or stuff that do clever things with promises or even just social interactions in general.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_427137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427137/#Comment_427137" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-14T03:39:33+00:00" title="January 14, 2014  3:39AM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Version 1.2 should be available by Sunday!

An explanation of when Principles clash would be interesting, though I'm not sure where I would put it in a small page count. I think that the best place to go is the Always Say or the Agendas - if using a 'secret' organization seems to follow the Principles, and the Rules, it's not really what Honesty demands. Don't obscure the truth, just tell them what's up.<br/>Figuring out some way to say that in a slightly more formal way would be helpful. Maybe expanding the "Always Say what honesty demands" entry to be talk about character knowledge vs player knowledge and the idea of "secrets" would be the way to go...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427784/#Comment_427784" name="Item_128" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-29T23:48:52+00:00" title="January 29, 2014 11:48PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh hey I made a post in which I looked through all the playbook moves and assessed whether I still liked each one.

It's been like four months... The game's not dropped! I had a very fruitful session at Go Play NW that I've been neglecting to actually do anything about. To put it shortly: PvP happened and now I know what that looks like and hopefully how to defuse it. Other lessons happened but that's the big one. After a deal of procrastinating, I'm finally getting off my ass and starting the next draft.<br/>Other major inclusions in the next draft will hopefully be some stuff about starting a game / establishing setting or situation (as this has recurringly been a veyr long process) and another quick-start batch of questions for a second premise. The Red Mountain has served me very well, but takes a slightly more serious tone rather than a goofy one since those are the episodes of the show I really latch onto, but many people expect Avatar to have that lighthearted whimsy, and a second lighter scenario could totally help with that. <br/><br/>Beyond all that though I have a question for folks! What would you think if I changed the term Honor to Respect? It's a little less on-genre (barely) but it's MUCH easier in sentences to be clear who confers benefit and who receives it. Do you think it'll still flow in general usage?<br/><br/>Oh, and I made a new dedicated page on the blog for Avatar World.

In addition to just looking better and being written more clearly, it's also full of art! I'll be honest: there are a few pieces that are in there just because I didn't want to leave the spot blank (and so will be replaced later) but some of it is for real.<br/>~ The Player Tag system replaces Harm, and Armor is revamped to match! I haven't played with this yet, but it draws on ideas that several groups produced after playtests, and it feels pretty good to me. Much more fictional and it solves my PvP problem! Also on a Tag note, the Basic Moves had a bit of modification to make when-to-place-Tags a little more obvious. Specifically, Speak Honorably can now place Tags, which makes using Chi in social situations much easier.<br/>~ Sub-playbooks are now in the book! Including one I debated whether to put in or not, but decided to go for it: The Avatar. Honestly I think I did a pretty good job with what could otherwise have been a very overpowered concept.<br/>Some of the sub-playbook stuff is also very last-minute, so fair warning. Still, that stuff will get less play than almost anything else in the book.<br/>~ There's a second Quickstart in there! While I really like The Red Mountin, its tone is a bit more serious and mystical and can trend away from the more social moves in the game. To complement that, The Festival of the Four is touched with whimsy and the lighter tone that many get from the show, while also being more social-focused rather than exploration-focused. <br/><br/>In general, I feel really good about almost everything in this draft. All the big things that have concerned me at all in playtests have been addressed, so all that remains is refinement. I intend to make the next revision the final one, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Download @ <a href="http://www.logbook-project.com/2014/08/avatar-world-v15-release.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.logbook-project.com/2014/08/avatar-world-v15-release.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437876/#Comment_437876" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T07:23:48+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  7:23AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yay!

The first session especially clicked really hard for me as what I would call my personal ideal session of Avatar World (tone-wise; mechanically the players might have rolled 10+ like three times total, they almost died in the first ten minutes thanks to a string of absolute failures). Maybe not everyone's perfect session, but was the very mystical and enlightening and bittersweet ending I love about the Red Mountain, and had either my favorite or second-favorite incarnation of Sel yet.<br/>The other games used the Festival of the Four which I'm still learning how to do, but it did exactly what I intended it to: be a more light-hearted and social premise with a lot of potential seeds. Building in Plots into the premises guided me like I thought it would, but in a good way.<br/>Player tags worked like a dream. I didn't Severely Tag anyone, but I wouldn't want that to happen often anyway. If anything I've always been a bit of a light touch on actually harming the players, Tagging them more often would probably be better since they have a buffer zone in the Mild Tags and clear those away pretty easily.<br/><br/>I wrote up the whole thing here:<br/><a href="www.logbook-project.com/2014/09/pax-and-avatar-world.html" rel="nofollow"></a><br/>Also check this:<br/><img alt="image" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BxMJKvvCMAA9SX4.png"/><br/>(I'm really happy about it, it's beautiful)<br/><br/>Anyway, future talk. I'm doing a real proofreading pass now and hopefully will catch all the crap that got past me last time. Seriously considering adding one more major section of explanations and stuff, but it might not be all that necessary.<br/>Or maybe some examples of play or something... but that would probably require re-writing most of the book. Maybe just a single extended example of play or something? I'd probably invent it instead of it being an actual replay/actual play, but we'll see. <br/>Other future thing: the final plan for Avatar World. This thing ends with me declaring a final draft and uploading it as a PDF to my site, for free, forever.

I wasn't the MC, so I figure having a player's perspective might be useful.<br/><br/>1. We had an amazing time overall even though all we did was sort of tooled around an Earth Kingdom village running errands and getting into shenanigans. Even though the scale wasn't "epic" in the sense of a D&amp;D game can be, there was still the possibility for interesting plot developments and adventures. We did get into a scrap with a group of earthbenders and waterbenders though. <br/><br/>2. The playbooks feel well-balanced. We had an earthbender, firebender, waterbender, and warrior with me playing the firebender. We each were able to contribute effectively to the narrative although in distinctly different ways: I was pretty focused on combat (having taken lightningbending) so my solution was mostly to attack, burn, or break things; the waterbender approached things much more like a puzzle; the earthbender was a bit of a blunt object and sometimes hurt more than help with his head-on solutions, and the warrior was always first to put herself in danger. The personality of each playbook really shone through mechanically.<br/><br/>3. The MC struggled a bit with how to actually run the game. He admitted at the end to being a bit confused about how to use tags and how they affected combat. He wasn't quite sure when an enemy should be considered incapacitated, for instance. He said he would appreciate more materials around running combat and perhaps an example of what a combat would look like. Generally, he seemed to settle for 2 tags removing an enemy from combat or if someone did something epic and creative.<br/><br/>4. It was unclear to me when I get my armor back after I use it. After some of my lightning rebounded, my armor luckily absorbed the brunt of the electricity, but left it pretty charred. Is there a mechanic for repairing armor? If so our MC wasn't aware of it.<br/><br/>5. I like the new playbook designs you recently introduced, but a few sections are a bit confusing or perhaps over-designed. The tags section, for instance, was hard to fit tags into. I think it would be helpful if it were bigger or divided in such a way to be more conducive to writing in. Also the slash in the armor section is confusing. Our warrior asked, "Why is my armor a fraction?"<br/><br/>That's my feedback for now. Overall, I just want to emphasize how much fun I had playing your game and I can't wait to play it again soon. I've played many *World hacks and this has been by far my favorite.<br/><br/>If you would like any help editing or proofreading, let me know and I'd be happy to help out.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438304/#Comment_438304" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-12T10:50:10+00:00" title="September 12, 2014 10:50AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for playing!

I totally agree with what you said, so I'll do a little redesigning soon once I figure out what I need.<br/>And I can absolutely write some further stuff in about incapacitating NPCs and armor. An example of play was actually on my short list of things I want to add, so that cold help. Approximately 1 or 2 Tags is definitely enough to take down most enemies, that seems about right for what I've experienced. For armor replenishment, there's not really a mechanic. I kinda hand-waved it as when you have sufficient downtime that you'd have time to fix up your armor (page 14), but it's not nearly as specific as the rest of the game, so I might do some revising and come up with a real mechanic for it.<br/><br/>Glad you had a great time, and thanks for all the kind words, it means a lot to me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439276/#Comment_439276" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-09T13:59:46+00:00" title="October  9, 2014  1:59PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">@horn_head_o</a>... one thing, Earthbending seems a bit weak to me (not necessarily mechanically, but more narrative/stylistically)...<br/>Every other bender has the ability to generically use their bending as part of some action, whereas the Earthbender seems not to.<br/><br/><br/>On top of this, the earthbending move is basically... can you earthbend?

Earthbending as a move is one of the more generic moves around, mostly because I've yet to come up with what I feel good about as <i>the</i> thing you do with earthbending while everything else is just basic moves. It's certainly functional, and when I'm running the game I play a little balancing act of whether I think an action they take is more earthbending or another move, but I would like to resolve the issue completely by writing a better Earthbending.<br/><br/>Do you have an idea of what that iconic "Earthbending" action might be? (if the answer's in Season 3 or 4 of Korra don't tell me what it is, just tell me that's where it is, I haven't gotten around to them yet)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439284/#Comment_439284" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-09T17:19:39+00:00" title="October  9, 2014  5:19PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I recall, from Airbender through Korra, the iconic Earthbending action seems to be "throw up a wall to defend yourself", followed by "throw pieces of the wall at the other person".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439286/#Comment_439286" name="Item_149" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-09T17:50:31+00:00" title="October  9, 2014  5:50PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true. The hard bit for me is that I try not to encode specific techniques (by similar logic to wall+projectiles the water whip is he iconic waterbending) and more the spirit of the technique.<br/>The other thing I've resisted is a defensive focus for the earthbending move, as the EB is already fairly defensive and I want to showcase the more varied elements of earthbending.<br/><br/>However, thinking about it again has given me an idea! If I make it about environment tags it becomes both offensive and defensive, becoming desirable, varied, and mechanically distinct from the Basic Moves. I'd have to compare with the waterbender, who also deals with Environment Tags before writing the move fully, but I'm thinking a trigger like "When you alter the topography of the battlefield".<br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439288/#Comment_439288" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-09T19:29:23+00:00" title="October  9, 2014  7:29PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Working thoughts:<br/>"Earthbending: When you alter the battlefield's topography, roll +Solid.

My hangup has been what the benefit is exactly. I like the  ideas behind using Armor, esp since the move will likely replace Defender (easily the last interesting move there), but given how Armor works now I'm still working through how to incorporate it best.<br/><br/>"Bulldozer: When your actions lead to the immediate destruction of (or relief from) an Environment Tag, gain 1 Chi."<br/>Valuable, interesti , versatile?

If the character attacking you was a PC, give that player the chi; otherwise, give the MC the chi.".<br/><br/>This makes Earthbend-&gt;Bulldozer-&gt;Defender a really cool and flavorful combo (but each is still pretty useful by itself).<br/><br/>This actually leads to another thing I was thinking of, though, where - since tags aren't necessarily physical - there's a disconnect between what armor is and how it's actually used. For example, the move "Stealth" tags people as "Unwitting Prey"... which you can use armor to prevent? If I get the tag "confused", or "tired", or "angry"... I can use my stone wall to protect myself?<br/><br/>It's not an insurmountable obstacle... I guess you could limit armor to only protecting against tags it would, in fiction, protect against, but that actually makes non-physical tags much better, since now there's almost no way to avoid them...<br/><br/>- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439434/#Comment_439434" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-14T17:37:40+00:00" title="October 14, 2014  5:37PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty interesting. Having both Bulldozer and Defender (the mechanic you proposed for it was also something I'd had nipping at the back of my mind but more fully fleshed out) necessitates axing something else though, gotta figure out what.<br/><br/>You've raised a good point about Armor. In many cases I treat Armor a little abstractly, spending it as defensive capability even on a mental level, but this is also a problem.<br/>..y'know, calling it Armor is kind of a holdover from the past when it attached to harm. Moments of luck and drive are a genre staple, maybe just switch the name to Fortune? It's still mechanically the same so I don't need to shuffle around who has what Fortune value, so that's simple. I just might do that.<br/>The other big problem I still have with Armor/Fortune is regenerating it. I'm thinking it might just refill at session start. Not fictional, but not unreasonable either.<br/><br/>So guess who got a year of InDesign CC for his birthday? I'm working on the next draft right now. Main redesign-y bits are the earthbender stuff we've been talking about, draining out some artifacts from the airbender (including rewriting the Training move, which I'm struggling with a bit right now), altering the design of the playbooks themselves to account for a bit of the over-designing on the inside-left page, and general typo repair. I also am gonna make some real art for a couple of the sub-playbooks that only received mediocre stuff cuz I was in a rush.<br/><br/>I'm actually really interested in any feedback on the sub-playbooks! None of them have ever been played, and many of the moves were designed in a single surge right before PAX this year, so I don't know if they actually hold up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439448/#Comment_439448" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-15T06:28:58+00:00" title="October 15, 2014  6:28AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 15, 2014 7:51AM by Antisinecurist.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, huh, axing something? For move count, I assume... is this a game design limit (every playbook only gets X move choices), a graphic design limit (can only fit X moves on the sheet), or something else?<br/><br/>I like moving to Fortune and having it refresh per session. Maybe add an additional trigger, maybe related to playbook or chakra?<br/><br/>Maybe - though it's probably not needed - a peripheral move for actual physical armor use? Like, "When you let your armor take the brunt of a physical attack, roll+solid. On a 10+, you avoid the worst of it and ignore any consequences. On a 7-9, pick one:<br/>- you suffer no harm, but you're dazed, knocked down, or pushed back<br/>- you suffer no harm, but your armor is damaged<br/>On a miss, you suffer the worst of it, plus your armor might take some damage, too."<br/><br/>I've had a few comments about some typos, so I'm sure my players will be overjoyed to see that fixed (one of my players is a bit anxious about spelling <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/>)... airbender training, hm...

"When you manipulate someone's blood to control their body"?<br/>\tBloodbending, Mechanic "even the strong-willed succumb", "only the weak-of-heart fall under your control"... who defines this? I think it needs to be more clear. Maybe "On a 10+, it affects them. On a 7-9, PCs can stand fast to refuse you, and NPCs are only affected if they've been tagged."?<br/>\tBloodbending, Mechanic "PCs cannot be bloodbended" - it seems weird that there's one particular move standing out that just doesn't work on PCs; I'd allow them to be affected, but give them an "out" (stand fast, as above, spend a chi, spend a fortune?)<br/>\tBloodbending, Wording "No one\u2019s ever bloodbended multiple people at once, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be the first..."; it may not be necessary to say this! I'd leave it up to player/MC question asking to resolve at the table<br/>\tScary, Typo "When you Speak Honorable"<br/>\tScary, Typo "any result less han"<br/>\tScary, Mechanic ... this one seems a bit weak flavor-wise to me, but I'm not sure how to fix it<br/><br/>Doctor - looks okay, I think<br/><br/>Lightningbender<br/>\tCharge, Mechanic "If accompanied by an unintended discharge of electricity that causes undesired consequences, gain back the Charge spent." I'm not sure you really need this actually, and it feels clunky and asking for trouble... "Okay, I gain +1 to every roll and havoc follows me everywhere? Sign me up!"<br/>\tMagnetism, Wording "You can move relatively small pieces of metal to your will." the wording here strikes me as a bit odd, but I can't say for sure<br/><br/>Masterless - looks fine<br/><br/>Metalbender<br/>\tImpenetrable, Mechanic: Maybe "When you manipulate metal to protect you from attack, roll+keen. On a 10+, repel any attacks for as long as you maintain your defensive stance (or until you run out of metal!). On a 7-9, protect yourself from the next attack you'd suffer."?<br/> <br/>Plantbender<br/>\tPlantbending, Mechanic: This one seems a bit lackluster to me. I'd much rather have a hold-and-spend with options like "grab someone's limb", "block someone's path", "cut and pester with thorns", "obscure or hide something"?<br/> <br/>Sandbender<br/>\tEarthflow, Mechanic: The 7-9 seems kinda weak if you choose the second option... they're basically trapped, but not really? I'd just make "On a 7-9, you can trap and tag them, but you'll need to maintain your focus to keep them there.".<br/> <br/>Spy<br/>\tFaceless, Wording: I think this is okay but it's nagging at me... I think it could be reworded but I'm not sure how<br/> <br/>Avatar<br/>\tEntry Condition, Wording "You must have been called upon to rebalance the world. You also must have spoken with the group and gained their consent." The first "You" is a character, the second is a player. It's clear, but not super-clear. I guess it could imply the avatar character must have spoken to the other characters about it (I know this isn't what you mean, but you see my point?)<br/>\tSpirit Within, Mechanic: "the duration of the scene" is ill-defined... not sure how to fix it, though... it also feels a bit weak over-all<br/>\tNatural Mastery, Mechanic: This seems really good! And disconnected from any fiction. I'd go with the following... it's much wordier but cooler and more even. "When you spend time and effort training under a master bender, spend 3 chi to gain their bending move."<br/><br/>- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439652/#Comment_439652" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-23T21:56:23+00:00" title="October 23, 2014  9:56PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 23, 2014 9:57PM by horn_head_o.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry it's taken me a bit to get back to you, it's been a crazy week but I've been using what you wrote to implement some changes! I'm really grateful for such a thorough look at what's there.<br/><br/>The move limit is largely just game design symmetry (with the one violator, the Waterbender, having their extra move essentially just be a peripheral on top of Waterbending). I could break it, but after some stewing I decided that Bulldozer could replace Counteroffense. While that move was alright, I never saw it get taken and I think that, for all its mechanical viability, it's just not that interesting in play if I also have the modified Defender (which  I basically just took from you).<br/><br/>I'm deciding against an additional Fortune-restoring trigger for now. To start with most characters don't have any, so it's a bit unfair if it's easily refilled, but actually I'm doing so because of Tag frequency. It surprised me that, at least when I'm running the game (and I have yet to play in another's AvW game since player Tags came into being), players don't get tagged that often. Just like how dealing Harm was a very powerful MC move that didn't always add that much to the fiction, there are often more interesting consequences to failure, and most players will just accept their Mild Tag without spending their Fortune on it because Mild tags can often narratively be resolved quite easily. As such, having a lot of Fortune or the ability to restore Fortune without too much effort is very very good. There are a couple ways to get a lot of it, but they require dedication. For this reason I think I'll leave players with what they have.<br/>However, I did add a new entry to the upper-tier improvements (the ones you can access after 5 improvements) to raise your maximum Fortune by one, letting even the 0-Fortune playbooks get in on the action.<br/><br/>For now I'm thinking a physical armor move is unnecessary. Actually wearing armor will just adjust fictional positioning of how you can be Tagged.<br/><br/>I've fixed a great many typos! On top of the ones you pointed out, I finally found the dynamic spell-checking option in InDesign, so the only ones left are the ones that are actual words.<br/><br/>The third suggested Airbender training move is brilliant and I'm using that. I had some thoughts about whether to make it trigger off of MWI or Airbending, but I like how MWI gives an incentive to occasionally have to roll +Fluid to get the ball rolling.<br/><br/>I re-did Bloodbending, changing much of what you mention but leaving the no-PCs note. It is anomalous among the game's moves, but it's also the only one that even gives you the ability to, with a single move, completely hijack someone's agency and even with a cost I don't want to enable that. Some of this is driven by my experiences with MH's Vampire move Hypnotic, which I desperately wish had a no-PCs clause as both in discussion and later in-play (as a victim of it) I've really become quite uncomfortable with what it's capable of. <br/>Scary is a bit weak flavor-wise, I agree, but it incorporates a thing that I find essential to being a bloodbender. Besides, I already invented an aspect of the bloodbender whole-cloth and I'd like at least half of the design to be based on the show's characterization of bloodbenders. I think a better synonym or phrase would go a lot further to accentuate the move.<br/><br/>With the Lightningbender's Charge, I think I'm going to keep it for now. If they want that +1 bad enough to hand over control elements to the MC constantly with that havoc, I'm comfortable with that. Plus as story gamers we're a little more comfortable with that idea than some gamers are - I get a remarkable amount of interest from primarily trad players with this game (I suspect because there are no other dedicated Avatar games), and I suspect they'd be much more hesitant about it. So I think there's a culture thing there.<br/><br/>I replaced Impenetrable with essentially the same thing (but named different as it's about Fortune instead of Armor) but that's a temporary fix, I'm deciding if I want to do something more like what you suggested.<br/><br/>Plantbending is something I've thought about for a while. For now, I'm leaving it as it is. Something I tried to do with all the moves is to keep them from being about specific tactical decisions (such as grabbing or cutting) and being more about the overall intentions of a move (hurting, impeding, etc). I think all of those are reasonably possible with plantbending, so instead I wanted to focus on HOW they do it and what that does to the fiction. The options are largely meant as imagination-drivers in this case, though each thing is somewhat desirable. I've yet to see it in action though so I won't say anything for sure until I've seen if it works how I want it to.<br/><br/>Entry wording of the Avatar was adjusted.<br/>I'm actually quite fond of Spirit Within. Scene is poorly-defined, but that's somewhat intentional - scenes with the Avatar State don't share traits of being confined to a specific place, time, power limit, or even continuous action, it just goes until it's obvious that it's time to come out of it. You could change location, cross-cut to something else, introduce new elements, and still call it the same scene if it's appropriate. It's a little bit of a wobbly technical definition, but I'm comfortable with that for now. As for its power level, that's a fair point, but I don't want it to be truly excessively strong. In many ways, it's a character guide more than a mechanical advantage I think - the prompts of when Spirit changes will affect behavior a lot more than the actual use of Spirit warrants I think. (the entire mechanic's concept is inspired by my ongoing experiences with a MH Angel and the maxed-out track moves).<br/>That's an interesting take on Natural Mastery, but it seems odd to take a move and then have to fulfill another (difficult) condition before getting any benefit. I'm also not entirely dissuaded by the idea that awakening your nature as the Avatar suddenly fills you with these abilities you didn't have before.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for such thorough feedback! It's gotten me working through a bunch of things, and I feel more solid about the sub-playbooks. I have a couple little things (art-replacement mostly) and I'll be posting v1.6.<br/><br/>EDIT: Woah, did the forum upgrade increase the character limit on posts?

I'll think on that!<br/><br/>Based on a discussion with someone on my blog's core AvW page, I'll be including a further description of how Tags work on both MC elements and on players, as well as a set of sample Tags to display what sort of things Tags are. That might actually do a good bit to dispel the rather-prevalent association with FATE's Aspects that I hear about. I'll also definitely be including an Example of Play in the next draft. I'm thinking I might record my next several games and take a really good representative scene and transcribe it (with editing), as I find that Replay style of play examples more rewarding than something invented or summarized.<br/><br/>Thoughts are moving!

It has been a very long time since I posted on Story GAmes (Or, sadly, got a chance to play an RPG) but I'll be MCing a long-form game starting in a week or so. <br/>The setting is very definitely Avatar-verse, but a few Avatars post-Korra, with a bit of a Cyberpunk/Biopunk theme. Wrote up very quickly a 'Databending' theme playbook specially for it (With the internet being information transmission using the Spirit Vines, and databending being an Airbending substyle).<br/>Avatar World is looking pretty great! <br/><br/>Of the two new subplaybooks in the most recent release, I really like the Spirit Medium. <br/><br/>The Lavabender seems to have a weak move in Equilibrium to me - Lavabending is about heat and such, but it almost feels like something that should fit in a Firebender playbook/subplaybook. But I really like the basic move and Weight of Expectations. I think with regards to a move for lavabending, I'd be tempted to lean towards something like: "When you isolate yourself and your allies using Lavabending, they you may give permission for them to spend your Fortune as if it were their own." It seems that primarily Lavabending is quite slow and defensive - the really common move is this ring to allow a group time to recover and rest. Though with only 1 fortune, it seems like mechanically it would be very weak. Perhaps something to do with removing allies tags or granting chi to isolate allies to give them a rest (Which would allow some tags to be removed fictionally)?<br/><br/>The other subplaybooks:<br/>Bloodbending: I really like. It has clear limitations, and it really feels like it does what it sets out to do. I'm especially fond of the second clause of scary.<br/><br/>Doctor: Looks good.<br/><br/>Lightning: Charge is really really fun. I have a player in the game who read through the book for the first time, then just pointed at it and said 'Well, I know what I'm playing now'<br/><br/>Masterless Traveller: Looks quite fun (I have a character looking to play an Airbender who has their eye on this I think), I'd like to see how it works in play.<br/><br/>Metalbender: Make my own luck and Shine and glitter seem to capture a bit of new and old Metalbending philosophy, which I really like. Transmutation seems a little off-flavour to me, but you have your own design philosophy with the game, and it seems very mechanically solid.<br/><br/>Plantbender: Looks good<br/><br/>Sandbender: I like Sandbending and Earthflow, but Solid Sand, to me, seems like it could use a bit of a boost. The 'Use a move with this stat rather than this one' moves always seem a it dull to me, unless they have a basic move or a condition with them. In this case, I think 'When you Move With Intention using sand' could act as a fun additonal clause.<br/><br/>The Spy seems really interesting, and has given me quite a few idea.<br/><br/>The Avatar I must admit, I kind of glossed over since it isn't one I think I'm likely to use with the playgroup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441071/#Comment_441071" name="Item_164" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-29T22:23:39+00:00" title="December 29, 2014 10:23PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wooooah, databending... that's super awesome. Is it a whole new bending of its own, or an advanced form?<br/><br/>I agree about Equilibrium being the weak link in the lavabender. Something defensive is sensible. My approach to the Lavabender was very much looking offensively, as the rest of the Earthbender mods are generally quite defensive and I thought the inherent danger of lava would be a good chance to step out of those lines a little.<br/>I'm going to be keeping Equilibrium for a little, but mostly because I have a player taking Lavabending today who is interested in the move and if I get a chance to see it in play I can get a better sense for it. If it doesn't work out, something defensive definitely sounds like a good path.<br/><br/>I'm also very fond of Scary on the Bloodbender, I think it's one of my favorite moves I've written. One of my players is angling to play the bloodbender, so I'm excited for that.<br/><br/>I also have a player who might migrate toward Lightning. Glad it's well-liked, along with blood and metal they're the ones I wanted to make sure were solid.<br/><br/>Masterless Wanderer is one of the sub-playbooks that I expect to see players pick up one move from and then jump into something else potentially. Spirit Medium is the same way. Not a bad thing - for that reason I have multiple people looking at it, which is interesting.<br/><br/>You're right about Transmutation's oddness. I'll be honest: I was kinda drained on the metalbender, it and the sandbender both were really hard for me to come up with full move sets. Transmutation almost feels odd to have in the game now that the show introduced the whole Platinum thing, but at the same time it makes the move even more powerful.<br/><br/>You're 100% right about Solid Sand. I dislike stat substitution moves, even with mitigating conditions. They are, however, an easy fallback. Solid Sand will probably be rewritten, or even replaced, if I get a good idea for it. Adding MWI could help it - "All of your sandbending moves, as well as Move With Intention, are made with +Solid instead of +Fluid." That's still not amazing, but it's better at least.<br/><br/>No worries about the Avatar, I think I'm going to see it myself in my game if we go into a Season 2. There are definitely things I want to see used about that one.<br/><br/>Thanks for all the thoughts! And wow, databending. That sounds like a great time. Enjoy your long-form!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paulie" title="Paulie"><img alt="Paulie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paulie">Paulie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441090/#Comment_441090" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-31T00:19:23+00:00" title="December 31, 2014 12:19AM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick thanks here, I have run a game of this a few weeks back and wanted to say thanks for writing a really neat game.

Quite a nice mix, we had a nice formal scene where they navigated the high society dinner where they met, a blistering motorcycle race (Where I managed to make good use of the 'Offer an opportunity move' with "Win the race or save your opponent from a landslide?", making for some nice character moments), and a chase through the streets of Omashu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441458/#Comment_441458" name="Item_168" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T04:43:33+00:00" title="January 14, 2015  4:43AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: the Chi economy, that is FASCINATING. Just earlier today I was going to make a post about my experiences with the Chi economy, and you've just thrown a crazy curveball into my thoughts.<br/><br/>I completed my 4th session of my long-form game on Sunday and they spent their fourth move-boosting Chi in that session. Most of them (save one character) have four or five advancements, mostly due to aggressively pursuing their Chakras, some flexibility on my part with handing out Chi, and a couple players who've had the worst dice luck I've seen in quite a while, going like two sessions with only a few 7-9s even. The lagging player has the reverse - he rarely fails, though his occasional failures have been <i>spectacular</i>.<br/>For my game, given the way I've written the big plot I'm using, it's actually been perfect for the pacing. The first session none was used. The second had Chi spent that I used to kick things rolling fast. The third had Chi spent that I ended up making use of in the fourth, and the fourth session had a Chi spent that I used to set up the cliffhanger. They also spent another that I'm hanging onto to trigger the final stage of the Plot at an appropriate moment. At the same time, the advancement count has been very similar to Monsterhearts actually - if we were playing MH, the season finale would be next time, the 5th session.<br/>One phenomenon I've witnessed in this game was an increase in willingness to spend Chi for move-boosting as time went on. I <i>expected</i> this. At first, characters only have a couple moves - almost all players will have their eyes on a few moves they saw in the playbooks and sub-playbooks that they want to pursue (though my group has been rather character arc/development-focused in our various games, so they my have had more in mind that many players do). They'll spend their early Chi pursuing those things and developing their character. As they get comfortable that they like their current crop of moves (or just start running out of move advancements that they like) they'll be more comfortable letting that Chi go to the moment rather than the future. Essentially, as time goes on, the balance of "Do I spend Chi on this move?" goes from "I could do well now or advance myself later" to "I could do well now, but the MC will get to push harder later."<br/>I'm happy with that balance. It makes the desire to gain Chi steady, unlike XP in games like MH which stops to matter a bit after you've reached your desired crop of moves and stats.<br/><br/>Your case is a fascinating counterpoint. I would expect regular Chi use from a one-shot, but the first part of a long-form game is surprising! Here's my thoughts on why I might expect that:<br/>~ The players just happened to always fail on rolls they considered very critical. It happens, but five times surprises me.<br/>~ The players are already comfortable with their crop of starting moves. Also surprising, but I guess it happens! <br/>~ The players are not familiar with what failure actually means in PbtA games, and that it is often just as interesting as success. Alternatively, simply clinging to the narrative authority - not a problem, but they should understand the trade-off that comes with spending Chi to boost their rolls, that they give the MC a big chunk of more long-term narrative authority by doing it.<br/>~ The players are used to one-shots and other systems where mechanical development over time isn't that important.<br/>~ The players feel that they're receiving so much Chi that they can spare it. This is a concern I thought might come up starting with my second session - I had a player advance three times that game, but it actually balances out in the end. I think it's just kinda surprising to keep track of it like that.<br/><br/>Any, all, or none of those! Do you have any additional ideas of why they might have spent like crazy? Ultimately it's not a problem - if the habit keeps up, you should adjust your Plots to either have smaller steps per Chi, many concurrent Plots to spread it out among, or higher costs per step in order to keep the game from escalating ridiculously fast (unless you want that!). They're making their choice about the cost, and the system is meant to handle that.<br/>The big thing I'm curious about is if they keep up that spending habit.<br/><br/>One other note about the Chi economy from my own game that surprised me: I have a hoarder player. He gets his Chi, and doesn't spend it. He knows he can, but has a very clear intention: he wants to take moves when it's dramatically appropriate for his character to pull out this cool new thing. He had 15 Chi built up at one point last session, though I gave enough circumstance that he advanced a couple times with it. This is an interesting way to play, and while it's totally outside of my original expectations, it's also totally valid and the system seems to flex to accommodate it.<br/><br/>This is great stuff. I know that for the final draft I want to write up some additional stuff about pacing and the Chi economy because it's clearly something that's not really static or universal to games.<br/><br/>Off that topic, your game sounds really fun! Glad the session went well <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/>. Chase scenes are great.<br/>And to everyone who's interested, I've been writing reports of my sessions as I've been doing them. I do the report on Twitter, then compile on Storify.

Under the advanced improvements is: "Gain an animal companion with ________" with the blank being filled in with a playbook-specific special trait.<br/>Pets are the one thing that is regularly present in the show and completely absent from the game. You could just narrate a pet, sure, but that's why you get a special trait with your pet! And it's a fun fictional thing, especially if it doesn't always do what you want. Pets are NPCs, and thus MC territory!<br/>AB: Flight<br/>AR: Charisma (ie the animal is likable or showy)<br/>EB: Burrowing<br/>FB: natural weapons<br/>MO: Patience<br/>SC: Intelligence<br/>WA: Armor<br/>WB: Swimming<br/>These aren't final.

He's been writing two more, The Peasant and The Hunter. They look pretty great so far and I've been workshopping them with him.

The Ninja is an ex-playbook, part of the initial lineup. After some complex thoughts about appropriation, cultural specificity, and redundancy, the Ninja and Samurai (as well as the original ideas for the Martial Artist, which fell through almost immediately) were merged into the Warrior.<br/>That said, several of the Ninja's moves made it into the game. Ambush and Stealth were transferred in directly, and some of the ideas made it into the Spy.<br/>Pirates/other bandit types are interesting. That's on a small roster of potential sub-playbooks! Doctors and plantbenders are already there even! The hard part is figuring out which archetypes are playbooks and which are subplaybooks. Two things help the distinction. One: if it's an obvious extrapolation of another, such as the advanced bendings. Two: if it acts as a modifier or addition to other archetypes. For example, "artist/performer," "criminal/bandit," or the Masterless Wanderer. Those aren't things on their own usually; if on a protagonist, they're usually subordinate to some other archetype.<br/>(that's far more than you mentioned, but I wanted to get the whole thought process out)<br/><br/>I have considered! I reconsider basically every couple months, and usually my mental functions end with "the game is weakened by dropping the specificity." Last time I thought about it though, the game wasn't as comprehensive - the more I refine and improve the book, the more I think it's worth it to wipe off the trademarks.<br/>Things that need renaming/changing if I was to do that:<br/>"Avatar World," "Airbending," "Earthbending," "Firebending," "Waterbending," "Soundbending," "Metalbending," "Lightningbender," "Icebending," "Bloodbending," "Lavabending," "Plantbending," "Sandbending," "The Avatar."<br/>"Title image," "Page 2 (and 118) image."<br/><br/>Huh. That's actually less than I thought. The title image would take a little work to replace, and otherwise I just need to come up with a LOT of good synonyms. I'm open to suggestion of course!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441812/#Comment_441812" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-21T16:58:40+00:00" title="January 21, 2015  4:58PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please note, for legal purposes, I make no claim on any suggestions I make here, you're free to use anything, yadda, yadda, yadda.

Working on fixing the remnants.<br/><br/>This leaves one huge rename to decide on: the title. Paragon World is okay, but I dunno, it doesn't feel right to me when I turn it over in my mouth a few times. A friend tossed out Legends of the Shapers or Legends of the Masters, neither of which feels quite right either. He also mentioned naming the Avatar figure "The Archon" which I kinda like, but I'm thinking I may drain away the Avatar figure as a whole from the book. I've been bouncing around the word Wuxia for the title, as it's the genre I'm working in, but the easy answer in Wuxia World is technically already a thing.<br/><br/><br/>Those two shifts alone would be enough to probably get away with the game legally, but at the same time it kills off my largest hook into the game for people. I could make it clear that Avatar is a great guide for tone and style for the game, but it still restricts the game's word of mouth ability some.<br/>If I only make these changes, the distancing is purely a negative impact. That would be ignoring the potential inherent in the shift - by dropping Avatar's connections, I also remove the restrictions. The question is, what can I do now?<br/><br/>Here's what's been discussed thus far:<br/>~ Expanding the playbooks a bit. This was probably going to happen regardless, but the nature of the expansion is a little different. In addition to The Peasant and possibly The Hunter that my friend is writing (which I think are appropriate, especially outside of the Avatar context). One idea that I've come to quite agree with is adding a fifth Shaper to the core lineup, the Spiritshaper. This both lets me indulge some of my ideas in a more core way, as well as instantly distance myself from Avatar a bit more. Another thing I'm still debating is the idea of splitting the Warrior back down the armored-soldier line (as The Knight) and the stealthy type (name tbd, trying to avoid The Ninja if possible, as well as Rogue or Thief). Depending on how it plays out, The Hunter might actually just be the new other half of the Warrior.<br/>~ The bolstering of the sub-playbook lineup with more non-bending subpbs, as that's a thing I want that is sorely lacking.<br/>~ A refinement of the existing playbooks, culling some moves and swapping some around.<br/><br/>Obviously this will be a full rewrite of the game again, but I can't really get going on that without one major answer: what is the game's <i>name</i>?<br/>So, uh, help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441997/#Comment_441997" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-25T12:01:20+00:00" title="January 25, 2015 12:01PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Element Shapers?<br/>Element World?<br/>Maybe not sexy enough.

Dang, I liked how Spirit World felt when I said it.<br/><br/>World of Wuxia...I don't remember but I think I considered and then rejected that, but I haven't the foggiest why. Maybe it was a similar already-taken scenario or something. Actually I think the same guy who snapped up Wuxia World got the inverse as well.<br/><br/>World of the Elements is alright. I feel like it's missing some zazz though.<br/><br/>I've been keeping World in most of the titles here because it was useful shorthand, I know it's by no means required. I've kept my mind open for some ideas, but haven't come up with a great one myself. Storm of Elements has some interest, but I don't have the perfect one in me yet. I think a non-World title will probably have the best chance though, so I'm trying to concentrate there.

The Elemental Way. The World of Balance (that one's okay I think). Balance of the Elements. The Way of Balance. Coming back around on Legend of the Shapers.

The Last Worldshaper is interesting and relevant, but locks me into a plot-y concept.<br/>However, that just made me think that Worldshaper is a GREAT name for the replacement for the Avatar specifically, if I decide to do something with that!<br/><br/>As for art, I love that idea for content. My art budget is, unfortunately, $0, so I will still be making all the art myself! For better or for worse, it's all my work. I'm considering that hiring a proper artist may be Kickstarter stretch goal material.<br/>The inspiration pieces for the style I was thinking of figuring out:<br/><a href="http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/354/f/9/f980d5e3bf2fa3cabe9efc530d373747-d5mqpc6.jpg" rel="nofollow">Spiritual State by dCTb</a><br/><a href="http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/300/f/4/avatar_state_by_dctb-d6s13wj.jpg" rel="nofollow">Avatar State by dCTb</a><br/><a href="http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/326/e/1/madara_by_moni158-d87bctn.png" rel="nofollow">Madara by moni158</a><br/>That style seems like it would really suit a cover for Legend of the Elements.<br/><br/>Speaking of Kickstarter, it's coming to my attention that I should start thinking about that. However, I know nothing about running a KS, and am not even sure what people would want or how much interest in things there would be.<br/><br/>Would you want a physical copy of this game?

I'd think <a href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">@Mike_Sands</a> (who ran the original crowdfunding campaign for Monster of the Week, which is another PbtA game, on IndieGoGo a while back) might also have some advise. And there's probably more people around here who are more than willing to give advise and feedback if you decide to go the Way of the Kickstarter.<br/><br/>I would probably pay $25 for it, depending primarily on shipping costs (I'm in the Netherlands, and paying the same or more for shipping than for a game itself usually means I'll go for the PDF version). Do make sure you don't get burnt by (international) shipping costs. There's a lot more to be said about Kickstarting a game, but that's fodder for another thread, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442325/#Comment_442325" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-31T03:08:44+00:00" title="January 31, 2015  3:08AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's been a while, so not sure if my advice on a kickstarter will be especially brilliant, but there's definitely a few things to make sure of before you start:<br/>- Know how much work there is left to be done.<br/>- Have people lined up for the extra things you need (art and editing in my case), and a plan for if any of them turns out to not be able to do the work.<br/>- Have a good budget: How much will each tier cost to fulfil, and how much will be profit? How much will you lose in fees? Have some extra room for things like shipping rates suddenly going up.<br/>- Having a playtest draft you can give backers (or allow interested people to check out) is a big bonus.<br/>- Don't make the tiers and rewards very complicated.<br/><br/>It might be worth starting a thread about this? There's certainly a whole bunch more smart people who can give you advice from both the project owner and backer sides of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442326/#Comment_442326" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-31T03:52:56+00:00" title="January 31, 2015  3:52AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be frank, you probably don't need to go the Kickstarter route, unless you were dead-set on getting some deadtree copies of the game (with professional art and layout) in the wild.

That's why I'm still at the "assess interest" phase before I actually move into any sort of planning.

It's been a while since I've had to write a whole playbook. Ground out the Spiritshaper last night. I think some of the moves are really creative, but some might be a bit complex. In general I wanted to play with some interesting concepts.\n<blockquote>THE SPIRITSHAPER<br/><i>You were once afraid of the monsters in your people's legends. They were ethereal and strange, like nature had special rules just for them. It was like they were from another world.<br/>You've learned those rules. You've visited their world and come back stronger. You're not afraid of the monsters any more.<br/>No, those monsters are afraid of you now.</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Stats: Add 1 to one stat.<br/>Natural +1, Hot -1, Solid +0, Keen +1, Fluid +1</blockquote>\nThe Spiritshaper's stats are thus more static than other playbooks, but is also flexible. It also has bonuses to the best three moves in the game (Speak Honorably, Observe Carefully, Move With Intention). Maybe I could be convinced to just do arrays, but I like the Spiritshaper being somehow weird and special, even among the other shapers.\n<blockquote>Chakras:<br/>~ Principled and immovable,<br/>~ Arrogant and zealous<br/>~ Intimidating and straightforward,<br/>~ Pacifistic and forgiving</blockquote>\nThe middle two are obvious in how they make conflict. The first is stubborn, and the last causes conflict with the more aggressive members of the group (and there always are some).\n<blockquote>Gear:<br/>You have 0 Fortune.<br/>A talisman against spirits. Choose its purpose: Sealing, Summoning, Destroying, Befriending</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Moves (Spiritshaping and one other) </blockquote>\nI'm teetering on just making this choose 2,\n<blockquote>* Spiritshaping: When you exert your will over a being's essence, roll +Fluid. On a 10 or greater, it accepts your command (perhaps with resentment). On a 7, 8, or 9, it contorts your command, fights you for control, or has some influence over you in return.<br/>If used against another player character, treat the command as an Oath.</blockquote>\nMind control/suggestion is a touchy subject in story games, especially when it's against players because of agency concerns. It's why I'm bothered immensely by the Vampire's Hypnotic in Monsterhearts. I think the Oath clause is a really good way to beat that; Oaths have a benefit if fulfilled, and a potential large penalty on a break.<br/>I'm still figuring out how I want the trigger to read.\n<blockquote>* Communion: When you summon a spirit to bargain for services, roll plus the number of conditions you fulfill:<br/>     ~ You present a substantial offering,<br/>     ~ You've met and established a price with the spirit in the past,<br/>     ~ You are in a place of spiritual power.<br/>If you attempt to perform the summoning hastily, subtract 1 from the roll.<br/>On a 10 or greater, the spirit fulfills the bargain before payment is needed. On a 7, 8, or 9, payment is required up front.</blockquote>\nIt could be argued that this treads the same waters as the Monk's Spiritual. However, I think this is, while similar, more reliable in exchange for more costly.<br/>The roll +conditions is cribbed from a suggestion by Cneph over in The Shining Void thread. I think it works well here.\n<blockquote>* Astral Projection: When you step outside of your physical body, roll +Natural. On a 10 or greater, you can observe or converse beyond your own body. You may return instantly at any time, but can still be hurt and your physical form is unconscious and helpless while you are elsewhere. On a 7, 8, or 9, the same but you are quickly noticed, either in spirit or physical form.</blockquote>\nTransfer from the Spirit Medium.\n<blockquote>* Medium: When you channel the ghosts of the dead, roll +Solid. On a 7 or greater, you may ask 1 question that they must answer to the best of their abilities. On a 10 or greater, you may ask an additional question or choose to embody the ghost. If you do the latter, take a Chakra in line with the ghost's personality and you may appear as the ghost did in life.</blockquote>\nI wanted to play with Chakras a bit. I like this idea. Ghost-talking is a totally appropriate Spiritshaper move.\n<blockquote>* Whispering Spirits: When you Observe Carefully, you may choose to answer questions instead of asking them. If you choose to answer, the MC chooses the question, and you may answer however you desire (so long as it is appropriate to the fiction). You may mix asking and answering if you are allowed to ask more than one question. However, if you answer any questions, the MC instead places the Tag or Environment Tag when the move is resolved instead of you.</blockquote>\nThis idea was also pulled from The Shining Void, built upon the Survey A New Planet move. Do not underestimate how strong that Tag can be! Observe Carefully is actually the largest source of Tags in my experience.\n<blockquote>* Contracts: When you complete an Oath to a spirit, they are obligated to grant you an additional boon. When you break an Oath to a spirit, you subtract 1 from all Speak Honorably and Act Dishonorably rolls until you reconcile with the spirit.</blockquote>\nWould this be better if all of your Oaths were stronger?\n<blockquote>Backstory:<br/>You have the Respect of a Great Spirit, and thus its True Name. What is it?<br/>I Respect _______ and have shown them the Spirit World.<br/>What spirit have you promised to summon for ________? What has complicated this summoning?</blockquote>\nThe Backstory is the first place it's implied that you can actually visit the Spirit World. Maybe it was a one time thing, or you can do it almost casually. Up to you.\n<blockquote>Mastery Move: <br/>Once you've trained with a master Spiritshaper, you may use any spirit's True Name to summon it at any time, without a roll, though it may not be happy or forgiving of this. A True Name must come from the spirit itself to be used this way.</blockquote>\nI think it's kinda cool.\n<blockquote>Improvements:<br/>+1 Natural, +1 Fluid, +1 Hot, +1 Solid, Spiritshaper move, Spiritshaper move, another move, another move, subpb move, subpb move, gain a Chakra<br/>Advanced Improvements:<br/>+1 Any, +1 Fortune, Retire to safety, second character, change playbook, exchange one of your Chakras for another, Ethereal animal companion</blockquote>\nNothing crazy. The Exchange Chakras advanced improvement is universal now. I know the advancements list is pretty darn large, but I'm actually alright with that. I find the other games' a bit limiting, especially MH where Change Playbook is almost always the optimal season advance because you're almost out of advances by the end of the season.<br/><br/>So how's it going? Keep in mind I wrote this all in one night, so if it seems like I was caught up on some idea, it might have just been that.

You're right that it seems pretty stylish and would totally fit.

I'm excited, especially because the player has already indicated he'll be taking Communion.<br/><br/>This isn't much of a content gift, but the new Worldshaper subplaybook!\n<blockquote>The Worldshaper<br/>Entry Condition: You must have been called upon to rebalance the world.<br/>(  ) Chosen of the World Spirit: You have a sixth stat, called Spirit. This stat starts at +0. Whenever you restore peace, increase your Spirit by 1 (maximum +3). Whenever you commit serious bodily harm, decrease your Spirit by 1 (minimum -1). At any point you may manifest the World Spirit. While you do, you are capable of shaping any element and use your Spirit stat for any rolls. When you release the World Spirit or at the end of the scene (whichever comes first), reduce your Spirit to +0 and take the Fatigued Tag.<br/>(  ) Force of Life: At any point, you may clear away all other Tags on your character and become Sealed. Sealed characters cannot shape any elements and may face other consequences. The MC will tell you what happens when you seal away the World Spirit, and possibly how to release the seal.<br/>(  ) Balanced Scales: Whenever you Tag another character, you may take the same Tag yourself. If you do, gain 1 Chi.</blockquote>\nThe first two moves are just former Avatar moves, slightly rewritten. The entry condition no longer requires formal consent as, without the actual character of "The Avatar" they no longer are a plot-dominating force. And there's no reason there can't be multiple Worldshapers. The last move is an idea I had. I don't know if it's really all that amazing, but I like the idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate" title="Inanimate"><img alt="Inanimate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/975/nEQWQKRE3OJ64.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate">Inanimate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442876/#Comment_442876" name="Item_213" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-14T19:47:10+00:00" title="February 14, 2015  7:47PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, big fan of the system! (And your Shining Void system.. and Super-lite Heroes... but those are other topics... : P)<br/><br/>First off, popping by to say I've started a campaign using your system to play in the world of Avatar 2000 years before Aang - <a href="http://ancientavatar.blogspot.com/2015/02/ancient-avatar-first-episode.html" rel="nofollow">here's a link</a>, if you're interested in reading not only the story, but listening to a recording of our session, to see how it plays out in real-time. They're all brand new to RPGs, so I thought you might like it to hear some valuable feedback, and get a sense of how newbies play the system. (So far, they're really liking it!) I hope you enjoy it - we certainly are!<br/><br/>Secondly, here's some feedback on the Spiritshaper:<br/><br/>- I love the flexibility in the stats. Feels very exotic.<br/><br/>- I dig the flexible talisman. Already, it feels like 'choice' or 'paths' might be a theme of the class?<br/><br/>- Spiritshaping feels problematic to me. You did a great job of balancing an inherently problematic ability, but even on a 10+, just being able to command things with spirits to do anything seems a bit much. "Kill yourself"? <br/>These balance issues aren't serious - I think this is fine as an ability you have to earn with an Improvement - but what I do think is concerning is that the Spiritshaping ability feels very invasive. Yet, most of the Spiritshaping 'archetypes' you have here are more about respect, cooperation, and advice. (A glance over the other abilities: Bargain, Meet, Ask, Answer, Cooperate) <br/>No other abilities in the Spiritshaping class feel so hostile. Yet, this is the first move you get as a Spiritshaper? I feel like the starting move should be something that almost every Spiritshaper archetype would use frequently - not one that many characters would avoid out of principle. Compared to the other 'shapings', this feels a lot more controlling and domineering - which makes sense, given the subject matter, but it also makes it a lot less open to characters of all moralities and such. If it wasn't "command", but "influence" or something, that might help.<br/><br/>A way to fix this is to indeed change it to "choose 2" rather than "Spiritshaping and one other". That way, not everyone is saddled with such an aggressive move.<br/><br/>- Communion is amazing. "Plus the number of conditions" is indeed an excellent mechanic, I'll be stealing that too. The conditions and results all look great to me. This is my favorite move of the playbook.<br/><br/>- I like the drawback of Astral Projection. That's gonna make for some great moments in the story.<br/><br/>- Hm, not a fan of this being limited to ghosts of the dead. Why not be able to converse with any form of spirit? It doesn't really fit in well with the other, more broad to interpretation, definitions of 'spirits'. As a newbie, I'd wonder - are all the spirits in the Spiritshaper class meant to be ghosts? Or is this move just specific for some reason? etc...<br/><br/>Taking a Chakra is amazing. Excellent usage of one of your core mechanics.<br/><br/>- Whispering Spirits is amazing. Great way to embroil the characters in the game more.<br/><br/>- Contracts feels weird with the wording "obligated". I also find it odd you can take Contracts AFTER you've gotten the Oath, and then get the bonus, when the spirit didn't know you had a Contract before you got it!<br/><br/>If this modified the act of taking an Oath, rather than the completion of the Oath, it would make more flavorful sense.<br/><br/>Regardless of that issue, the move itself seems fine. What do you mean by "all of your Oaths were stronger"?<br/><br/>- Backstory: I love all of these.<br/><br/>- Mastery Move: This one is so good, I'm sad it's a Mastery Move! What fun flavor and potential complications! Also, one small thing - I was a bit saddened that none of the Mastery Moves had names! It's not necessary at all, but I think it'd be a nice addition if you find the time for it. ( :<br/><br/>- Exchanging Chakras is a perfect universal advanced improvement - helps reinforce character development.<br/><br/>Alright, feedback over! Overall: This looks like a fun and flexible playbook, with lots of potential interpretations of such simple, but open, moves. A great example of the possibilities of the system. Nice work!<br/><br/>Lastly, I have a question of my own: in the session, we were discussing what 'dodging' would be. Stand Fast? Move with Intention? I interpreted it differently based on the moment - if the dodging was under serious pressure, I made it Stand Fast, but if it was just a simple evasive maneuver, it was Move with Intention. What are your thoughts on this division? Do you have your own ideas of what a 'dodge' should be represented as?<br/><br/>All in all, thank you so much for this system. Not only is it a delight, it's an inspiration! Seeing all the amazing work you've done with the *World system has inspired me to start doing my own explorations of it as well.

I'm really looking forward to listening to it later tonight. The game sounded really cool, I really like how the story's unfolding. I may have more specific comments after hearing the session and seeing how you exactly engaged with the system.<br/><br/>"Choice" as a theme is interesting, and I can see the bones of it in the playbook. Nice catch, I like that concept!<br/><br/>Influence is probably a much better word. Compel maybe, though that's a little forceful still.<br/>I'm thinking I <i>am</i> going to make it Choose 2 Moves. I tried out Spiritshaping+1 because of the consistency with the other -shapers, but Choose 2 is more appropriate. A player of mine created a Spiritshaper last week with the "Make a second character" advanced improvement, and I got the sense that it's more reasonable to give the choice.<br/><br/>Only Medium is meant to be specific. It's a little more narrow, but I think it captures a certain type of character that would not otherwise be easily drawn into the Spiritshaper. Also, without calling out, for me personally I wouldn't have thought "ghosts" when I read spirits in the context of the spiritshaper, largely because ghosts aren't really much of a thing in Avatar. I kinda like the specificity as well, even if it might narrow the move away from some characters.<br/><br/>Hmm. I definitely agree about switching it to triggering at the front to prevent that weird post-Oath obligation.<br/>"When you make a bargain with a spirit, they are obligated to grant you an additional boon upon completion of the Oath."<br/>I like obligated, or maybe obliged. I'll play around with the syntax, but the word is a really strong legal-sounding word.<br/>This wording also means they can not <i>tell</i> you the additional boon's nature until later, and that's kinda fun.<br/>Stronger as if the move worked on all deals, not just with spirits. These Oaths are "stronger" because they involve greater rewards and greater consequences for failure. I'm leaning to just with spirits.<br/><br/>Naming the Mastery Moves might be fun! I'll take a look and see what I can think of. Probably not in this draft, but next one maybe!<br/><br/>Alright, dodging! My take on dodging is that it would be Stand Fast. It's done in reaction to another acting against you. It would be Move With Intention if you were actively taking a position that's easy to dodge from or if you make the move in anticipation. <br/>Basically the distinction is: if you make the move before they actually make the attack, MWI.

In fact, a few things in the new version might need to be explained better, simply because you're distancing yourself from Avatar. Such as how shaping is alike or different from bending, what role the elements play, etc.<br/><br/>I agree that "obliged" is a good word. Obligated feels as if they're compelled to do it by some force - obliged makes it more clear that they're doing it because of your natural skill.<br/><br/>I agree that limiting Contracts to just spirits is fair. You are the <i>Spirit</i>shaper, after all!<br/><br/>Thanks for the advice on dodging. That's pretty close to what I had in mind, but mid-session it's more wishy-washy and difficult to make rigid definitions like that, so I fudged it a few times. By "simple evasive maneuver" I meant without actual pressure in combat, so yeah, pretty similar trains of thought. ( :<br/><br/>Also, a random note, but I just realized almost every single Spiritshaper move is directly related to spiritshaping or hangin' with spirits. The other playbooks generally mix it up a bit more in this regard: Earthbender has 2 non-bending moves, Firebender 3, Airbender 4. The only other bending playbook with so few non-bending moves is Waterbender. This isn't a problem at all - just noting, that it might limit the moves people can take from the playbook even if they aren't a Spiritshaper. For example, I could totally take "Driven by Honor" from Firebender, even my character isn't a Firebender at all - it works fine for any character. But pretty much every move in Spiritshaper, aside from Whispering Spirits (and maybe Astral Projection?) is directly spiritshaping related.<br/><br/>Again, that's not an issue at all - just noting. I actually think it's probably fine, as it will balance out well with the Waterbender, and just talking to spirits doesn't necessarily mean you're a spiritshaper at all.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>I actually haven't played Superlite Heroes yet either, haha! Those lighter games are always a marvel to look at, but surprisingly tricky to get people to play. I'll see what I can do about trying it as a "beer and pretzels" night - I think it'd be a great way to send off a board game night, for example.<br/><br/>My thoughts aren't that lengthy, so I'll just drop what I loved about it here: <br/>- Stats that serve so many purposes at once in such cool ways<br/>- Diversity of the strengths and drawbacks <br/>- "Become a villain or die": What a strong sentence that captures so much about the genre at once!<br/>- Drawback on <i>highest or lowest</i> - I love the almost throw-away note that restrictions aren't just for 'weakness' but also a necessity for 'strength'.<br/><br/>Of course, after I play it, I'll probably have more to say about it.

I mostly meant that's why my thinking differentiated the two concepts. I'll think on which I want to use...<br/><br/>Regarding the focus of the Spiritshaper's moves, I definitely see what you're saying. In this case, I think I was largely driven by two aspects: one, I don't have many (if any) great reference characters for spiritshapers in my head so it's harder to get away from the "cool powers" concept, and two, a lot of the spiritshaper's potential non-spirit-y moves are basically just Monk moves. Of course, this leads to a lot of synergy between the two playbooks! And at the same time as all the spiritshaper's moves seem somewhat focused, none of them is actually reliant upon having any of the other moves. A regular Firebender could totally take Whispering Spirits if they could justify it in the fiction in some way. That was a goal in the draft I'm currently working on: almost none of the moves are reliant upon other moves to function, meaning that even the benders' moves are wide open for taking.<br/><br/>And thanks for the Superlite Heroes! feedback! You basically summed up the bits that I thought were pretty special about it, so I feel pretty happy about that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>********************************<br/>My home game has been going quite well. We're dropping another player due to life but regaining one in a couple weeks. Might be able to conclude the game by then if this gets played in a certain way. We just had our big spirit-y episode, in which I busted out the far limits of my "spooky spirit imagery" collection, culminating in revealing what might be the ACTUAL big bad guy of the plot, an ancient great spirit named Empty Serpent (who's form is a giant molted snakeskin, but with an infinite expanse of blackness inside only visible when it opens its mouth to you, otherwise it's nearly transparent). I'm very excited to play around with this super-creature. I think I'm going to have it kill the Great Spirit of Earth, Seiryu, tomorrow. That'll kick the remaining game into motion.<br/><br/>I'll probably also try to tease some of what I have so far for the next draft this week. I'm thinking I'll share the playbook file, which includes a slightly reworked playbook layout, three new playbooks (the Hunter, the Peasant, the Spiritshaper), and a bunch of move edits. Look forward to that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate" title="Inanimate"><img alt="Inanimate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/975/nEQWQKRE3OJ64.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Inanimate">Inanimate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442923/#Comment_442923" name="Item_217" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-16T00:38:07+00:00" title="February 16, 2015 12:38AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, you did a great job of making each of the Spiritshaper moves interesting to take alone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443041/#Comment_443041" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T01:28:14+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  1:28AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the playbooks are now available for download in their new layout!

Data is passed between networks using the power of the spirit vines, in a mutualistic relationship that feeds the vines with spiritual energy, and enables the simple and speedy transmission of information between individuals. In the advent of Varrick corp's 'Wyld-Fi', which uses modified blooms to produce nodes of vineless spiritnet, it looks like it will only grow in popularity.<br/><br/>The databender manipulates this. By spiritually projecting themselves into the vine network, they can observe and direct the flow of energy, for good or ill. Some work in lucrative jobs as security experts for large corporations, some as police workers who specialise in plumbing networks for information, whilst some turn to a shadier side of the business, using their skills to observe and alter data not meant for their eyes.</i><br/><br/>Entry requirements: Must possess the Airbending move.

Aww, next time I guess... If you happen to still be at the con tomorrow (Sunday) I'll still be there from 10 to 5! I will probably be running The Shining Void tomorrow, but I can always be persuaded by specific requests!<br/><br/>I had a <i>great</i> game of LotE this morning. I ran The Red Mountain and it crossed into Lovecraftian territory, which was pretty cool (and despite the players' surprise at their own bringing it in, this is not actually the first time I've seen weird eldritch horror stuff in the game!). Jacob Possin, the designer of Jadepunk (a game with a similar basic genre, but for Fate Core) was a player, and I learned partway through that he had actually played Avatar World with his own home group before! That was exciting. We also had my first play of The Hunter, which worked great (though one of his moves was Stealth, which I've seen many times before, but Guerrilla Tactics worked right!<br/><br/>We had two feedback pieces about the game. One player expressed some concern that, as they understood it, the Chi mechanic might lead to hording behavior, which I can't deny; after all, I had a hoarder in my long-form game. Personally, I don't think that behavior ended up hurting the game at all, but have any of you had an odd experience with it?<br/>The other feedback was that occasionally things that felt like they were moves had to be shoehorned into the basic moves, usually Move With Intention, even though the exact results were a bit weird. I think this game was a bit anomalous in that that situation came up more often than usual, but it's definitely valid. The question is: what can I do about it, and is it worth it to do anything? My opinion right now? Leave it alone. But I'd love to hear other people on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444475/#Comment_444475" name="Item_228" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-29T20:23:19+00:00" title="March 29, 2015  8:23PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They sold out of Saturday and Sunday tickets long ago.

That's something I've been looking for a bit, and I think I slightly rectified in this draft! The Hunter is easily able to optimize for working with an animal companion; you can get one straight off, and either gain more or expand their abilities through moves. Any character can take an animal companion with an Advanced Improvement as well.<br/>The main thing is that controlling the companion is not a move-assisted action, it's just narrative (and governed by the Basic Moves, of course). Treat using animal companions as an extension of the player character.<br/><br/>Do you think this covers the character type? I find that, generally, characters with companions tend to not be an archetype of their in (in terms of what actions they take) and as such a whole playbook felt superfluous. I prefer it with animal companions as an Advanced Improvement, even though that holds it off for a bit; I'd typically just make an exception if it was the vital aspect of their character and they didn't want to play a Hunter. <br/>I've also been considering a sub-playbook focused on companion stuff. More non-shaper subPBs is a plus, and I'd make the entry condition pretty forgiving.<br/><br/>EDIT: Hey DiscoSoup, I'm seriously considering doing Rose City Comic Con.

In AW, vehicles, weapons, and even NPCs in the form of gangs and what-not tend to have some kind of mechanized interaction; sometimes that's just harm they deal or armor they have but sometimes it's a special move or, in the case of vehicles, a stat bonus. That obviously doesn't mean you have to do that and you can always envision narrative in terms of the mechanics whether or not there's a specific guidepost for it in the rules but I guess I'm wondering what your thinking is on treating Animal Companions one way over another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444793/#Comment_444793" name="Item_232" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-14T00:11:43+00:00" title="April 14, 2015 12:11AM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh my, you've caught me in a contradiction! I totally forgot I said the NPC thing. I think I'm gonna go back on that and treat them as an extension of a character.<br/><br/>Here's my general thinking: the most common form of mechanical interaction is the Move. There would be two types of potential moves for animal companions if taken as a general category: force them to do something or they take decisive action. <br/>The former doesn't fit the genre - in ApW it makes sense with gangs and such because ultimately they're <i>competitors</i> for resources, and scarcity is the game's core theme, but Avatar is never really made more interesting by competition with your own companion. I can't think of a single instance where any Avatar animal companion actually <i>resisted</i> its owner's command. Ultimately, failure on such a roll is just not that interesting - the only major form of trouble that comes from the animal companions is when they're taken away entirely.<br/>The latter move, where they take an action, is certainly doable, but it doesn't interest me because anything I wrote for them would be just a variation of a Basic Move, so it's just easier to just make them an extension of the character. Because I'm handling animal companions generically through traits (rather than list form, like "flying bison" or "polar-bear dog" or "shirshu"), I can't write specific moves for animals, though I encourage custom moves for that!<br/>Alright, so probably not a move.<br/><br/>The simplest mechanic in the game would be a stat bonus! Unfortunately for that, I'm dreadfully allergic to floating +1s like that. They slow down play, and if there's enough of them out there it throws the game's balance off. It makes accumulating companions really valuable mechanically, and it throws the Hunter way off. Basically, that kind of bonus stuff is where I've been trying to stay away from.<br/><br/>And of course, Harm and Armor don't really exist in the same way. It doesn't really make sense for them to be able to act as Fortune, and they're pretty divorced from the Chi economy. Maybe they could act as a Chakra (so if the animal companion leads to inter-PC trouble, gain Chi), but even that kinda stacks the Chakra list a bit high (to 4, with option to replace one).<br/><br/>Basically, animal companions aren't mechanically distinct because there's no mechanics that I think they reasonably mesh with! They're still valuable in a narrative sense, so they're not irrelevant, but I can't think of a good mechanical way to integrate them.<br/><br/>As for Advanced vs Standard Improvement, part of it is just intuition because the Standard Improvement list is already quite long and I could use some options populating the Advanced list. Also, dropping it to the Standard list also throws the Hunter off his balance a bit and takes away one of the things that makes them distinct. Personally I also think it's just better to pace it further on, though that's not a big factor design-wise.<br/><br/>That answer your questions?

There's nothing mechanical about having an animal companion. Because there are no mechanics you need to wait for (an animal companion that only later becomes an Animal Companion), and there is nothing fictional preventing you from acquiring animal companions through other means, it feels unduly insignificant for an Advanced Improvement. If there were a more elaborate fiction around them (such as with retiring to guaranteed safety), perhaps this would not be a conflict and the fictional restrictions would be sufficient to make it feel like your getting something properly Advanced Improvement-y.<br/><br/>As a more extreme example, in Apocalypse World the Driver can get new vehicles as Advancement via Moves. Of course, they can also acquire vehicle during the game in a fictionally sensible way. I think it would be very strange to get a car as a second tier advancement in AW. It wouldn't feel as <i>big</i> as the other second tier advancements. I mean ... a whole new PC shaking up the world? A whole new playbook? Safe retirement in this bullet-riddled mess of a world? And then ... you get a car. Well, crap, you can get a car any day of the week.<br/><br/>Obviously Animal Companions have a more elaborate introductory fiction than "Roll to hotwire Proust's dunebuggy," but that's the feeling I'm getting at. Getting a car for free is a big darn deal, but in a lot of AW worlds, it's not <i>that</i> hard to get ahold of one not-for-free. I imagine this could well be true of animal companions.<br/><br/>P.S. Also it seems you can already get one by taking the Hunter's Friend of Nature as a normal Improvement as a move from another playbook making it even more strange as an Advanced Improvement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paulie" title="Paulie"><img alt="Paulie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paulie">Paulie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444813/#Comment_444813" name="Item_234" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-04-15T19:33:21+00:00" title="April 15, 2015  7:33PM">April 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not a whole play book ?

I'm definitely reconsidering it now.<br/><br/>Paulie: My large objection to including them as a core playbook is the question of: what do they <i>do</i>? They're defined by something they <i>have</i>, rather than their character type. I can't think of any characters from the shows who were not something else first, but with a companion. Aang is an Airshaper more than he is Appa's partner, Korra is foremost a Watershaper rather than Naga's rider/owner, June was a Hunter first despite how closely she's associated with Nyla... You even mention that, before he's a guy with a fireferret, Bolin is an Earthshaper.<br/>"Has a close animal companion" is pretty consistently a subordinate archetype across the genre. I created the subplaybook system specifically to handle subordinate archetypes like that.<br/>That said, you could theoretically have a move from the subplaybook from minute one! It's a subtle fact of the system in the latest two drafts that starting with "____ and one other move" or starting "with two moves" doesn't actually rule out starting with subpb moves. I just leave it kinda understated so it doesn't flood everyone with just how many options they really have at character creation.<br/><br/>Also, some forms of animal companion are, honestly, entirely fictional. Pabu and Momo, basically. As practical members of a party, they bring almost literally nothing to the table. As an MC, I would just let you have it. That's the difference with the companions that are mentioned mechanically - they have a trait. They can fly (like Appa) or swim or are battle-hardened or great trackers or <i>something</i> useful. I need to refine the traits listed because I don't like what I have right now, but conceptually that's the distinction.<br/><br/>In the simplest terms, I just can't think of any set of actions that is iconic to the animal owners as a category. Same problem why I don't have any moves for the companions.

Honestly, it's more like a pseudo-playbook, though I would never use that word in the book.<br/><br/>The Animal Companion is a supplemental sheet that you get when you take an Animal Companion (whether through the Hunter's gear, the Friend Of Nature move, or the Advanced Improvement). The Animal Companion has one stat, Animal (clever, I know), and this starts at +1.<br/>The Animal Companion is generally an extension of its owner, and can be used to make Basic Moves using their stats. The Companion can be assumed to be loyal, and does not normally need to be convinced to follow intuitive or non-suicidal commands.<br/>Companions can be Tagged, but do not receive Mild Tags, only Moderate or Severe.<br/>In addition to the Basic Moves using player stats, there are five Animal Companion moves. One general move, two riding moves, and two hunting moves. Depending on how exactly you're gaining access to the Animal Companion, you get two moves, possibly with one of them being restricted to a Riding or Hunting Move. For example, if you are a Hunter starting with an Animal Companion, you get two moves, one of which must be a Hunting Move.<br/><br/>Here are the five moves:<br/>(   ) Wild<br/>Your companion has an Animal score of +2 instead of +1.<br/><br/>Riding Moves:<br/>(   ) Special Terrain<br/>Choose one type of terrain your companion can easily traverse: clouds, sea, solid stone.<br/><br/>(   ) Speed<br/>When you ride with haste, roll +Animal. On a 7 or greater, you reach your destination swiftly. On a 7, 8, or 9, choose one:<br/>~ trouble finds you there.<br/>~ your companion is exhausted.<br/>~ your arrival causes a big scene.<br/><br/>Hunting Moves:<br/>(   ) Teamwork<br/>When your companion is an equal participant in your <br/>maneuvers, roll +Animal in addition to rolling your own move. On a 7 or greater, you may choose to use that result instead for your move.<br/>[I haven't entirely run the numbers on this, but I think it works out? If a 6- is rolled on Teamwork, it's a Hard Move, meaning the chance gives you an extra chance, always with at least a +1, to get a 10+, but also gives another chance for a hard move]<br/><br/>(   ) Tracking<br/>So long as you have some recent physical link to a subject, you can spend 1 Chi to find them (though it may not be fast or stealthy).<br/><br/>It is entirely reasonable for an MC to call for custom moves rolling +Animal, and Hard Moves can be used to break the "assumed to be loyal" clause.<br/><br/>Regarding the idea of an Animal Playbook, I like the idea, but it's out-there enough that I wouldn't put one in the main book. However, given that "Limited Edition" playbooks are a bit of thing still (especially since I don't actually mean limited), the Animal might be a great first one of those. Alternatively, a Stretch Goal playbook if I eventually choose to Kickstart a physical run.<br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>EDIT 5/5 11:18: Oh, quick note, those move names are not final, they're just descriptive. I'll be coming up with more clever move names.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445441/#Comment_445441" name="Item_239" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-31T22:12:35+00:00" title="May 31, 2015 10:12PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so I wanted to drop in and update y'all! We're now in the home stretch: today I finished and implemented the last piece of art for where I am. Here's a brief timeline of my self-imposed deadlines:<br/><br/>Monday 6/1: I play a session this evening that I will record so I can write the missing Example of Play chapter.<br/><br/>Wednesday 6/3: Having implemented the Example of Play chapter, I send the files to my editors for review. This is more of a literary review, rather than a mechanical one, but there might be things exposed that I goofed up that will adjust rules slightly.<br/><br/>Saturday 6/6: I finish the peripheral documents. On this day, I will be removing the free version of the game from the internet in the lead-up to a full release. I may leave up something to whet the appetite, but you won't be able to get the whole game anymore. Get it this week!<br/><br/>June 19: I print a copy of the game for myself to use at conventions. If I'm lucky, the editors will be back to me. If not, I'll print another later - I need a copy for Go Play NW.<br/><br/>June 26: Coinciding with Go Play NW, this is the fall-back deadline for everything's completion. I'll be running two sessions of Legend of the Elements, as well as one session of The Shining Void, so if you can be in Seattle this weekend I'd love to play it with you!<br/><br/>August 28: Coinciding with PAX Prime, I want to have the game up for sale online as a PDF and on Print-On-Demand, with a small pile of copies of my own coming with me to PAX. The end of a...wow, almost three-year line from an idea for my first game design to a published and refined game.<br/>Oh, and if anyone knows anything about where they would like to buy games or where you can get good Print-on-Demand work done, I would <i>love</i> to know so I can work it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445559/#Comment_445559" name="Item_240" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-06T22:43:06+00:00" title="June  6, 2015 10:43PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, well, I lost my wallet last week so I never made it to that playtest session or sent the files off, but that's why I'm giving myself some extra time!<br/>However, that doesn't push back the tear-down date - the game is no longer publicly available!

That was definitely my A game, especially at the Festival - as far as handling the scenario from an MC perspective, that was the best I've handled it. We had an angry super-powerful grandma spirit, a little love story, a Mulan-ing, old souls ruminating over their tea, an internal power struggle within the Fireshapers, and an astral projection spirit fight!<br/><br/>That's not the big news though. Two things came up over the weekend.<br/>1) The books are pretty gorgeous. Not perfect yet, but damn near.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QOvZmV0zdNs/VYzYfrKVhTI/AAAAAAAAAGY/HSG-XyFVa8k/s1600/LotE%2BProofs%2B2.png"/><br/>The covers are of a version of the cover that I painted over the last couple weeks using black acrylic and some watercolors. I really like it, though I think I have a little more work to do - I've never painted before so this is a learning experience.<br/><br/>2) The Kickstarter will be happening, and will be starting August 1. I'm in prep mode already. If you have anything you'd like to see in a LotE kickstarter, speak up! If you'd like to contribute stretch goal materials, also speak up! I'm a big fan of using stretch goals as a way to draw the community into a project, rather than just as a way to expand content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447522/#Comment_447522" name="Item_242" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-01T07:02:19+00:00" title="August  1, 2015  7:02AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After a month of preparation, it's here!
