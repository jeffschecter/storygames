I mean, back in the day, we played <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> and <em>GURPS: Fantasy</em>.  So we strayed closer to crime-fighting or continent-spanning epics.  So I went online and found: <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/oa/20051031a" rel="nofollow">Tomb of Horrors</a> and <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/oa/20051207a" rel="nofollow">White Plume Mountain</a>, which are available as free PDFs.<br/><br/>And I read them.<br/><br/>So, um... are all D&amp;D dungeons this lame?  I mean, this shit makes no sense whatsoever!  <em>Tomb of Horrors</em> ends with a complete anticlimax after the GM basically tortures the players for not having read the adventure before playing.  <em>White Plume Mountain</em> has chamber after chamber filled with random monsters and guards who are guarding dead ends.

It was designed as a player killer for those who had already seen it all, so to speak.  I'm not familiar with the other one.  You might want to look up Temple of Elemental Evil if you can.  That one is much better.<br/><br/>But yes, over all that's what a Dungeon Crawl is.  It's about two things a) exploration and b) overcoming the next encounter.  If the GM has gone the extra mile then there's some context to the encounter that at least makes it appear some what logical like the basement is flooded and therefore some water serpent has made it's home there.  But the disconnection of encounters is a D&amp;D staple.  The "point" of the adventure might be to defeat the wizard whose built his lab on the third floor but that has little to do with the Yellow Mold growing on the dishes in the forgotten wing of the castle or the wererats that have taken up residence in the basement or the giant bats living in the chapel bell tower.<br/><br/>If the GM has gone the EXTRA EXTRA mile then some encounters are linked.  Like if you've killed the wererats then nothing happens when you trip the alarm in the bedroom.  But if you HAVEN'T killed the wererats then they show up if you trip the alarm.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134176/#Comment_134176" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T16:37:41+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  4:37PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I could tell you some stories.  <br/><br/>So I will!<br/><br/>One time, I designed and ran a dungeon where an entire level was X shaped sections of tunnel mounted on tuntables that turned 90 degrees any time someone activated a trigger plate.  I actually ran that for almost an hour, while the players scrupulously mapped these corridors that seemed to run straight but were actually leading them in circles.  Hilarious!  <br/><br/>I can't believe what an ass I was.<br/><br/>A good dungeon leads players through a series of interesting set-piece encounters (interesting terrain, split-level fights, ambushes from secret tunnels), presents a few tactical or logistical decisions (press on or turn back, clear out side tunnels or go for the main goal, take this secret passage or stick to the known routes), and imparts something of the mood or setting (it's an old dwarven mine, it's a long buried space ship, it's what remains of a earlier, more civilised age).  Most of all, a good dungeon is a pacing device.  It lets you build up to the main encounter.  It's a railroad without the illusionism, because the tracks are 10' wide corridors through solid stone.<br/><br/>I love a good dungeon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134177/#Comment_134177" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T16:37:57+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  4:37PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomb of Horrors is <i>sui generis</i>.

I've gotten a lot of insight from looking at the actual D&amp;D books that you were expected to play the modules with. In other words, don't look at White Plume from the standpoint of someone who has 3.0 D&amp;D in mind, including the DMG and the worldbuilding advice therein.  Look at it from the point of view of someone with the books that they actually would have used to play it at that time.<br/><br/>Similarly with other classic modules.

First because it's all traps, which satisfies the bloodthirsty ghost of Goldberg in my head.  Dig this: every door in the whole dungeon has a simple latch mechanism: you poke a finger in a hole and push a lever at the back.  Of course, there's three holes, and two of them cut off your finger.  And it does all make sense - apart from the "in order to open the real door to the tomb (or Evenrude the Water Wizard, natch) you must pretty much trigger every trap in the whole thing" thing.  Also that the treasure is almost entirely in the high quality springs and weird magics used to build the traps.<br/><br/>Simon, I love the turny passages idea.

You can throw in a few little things in between, like traps, forking tunnels, non-hostiles, and things, but I like to stick to about three "big fights", including the big finale.  Between them should go the interesting choices and stuff.  For D&amp;D 3.5, four is the magic number.  Four good challenges is what it takes before a party needs to rest and recuperate, barring good or bad luck.  In a dungeon, you can put in a few more, like five or six, if you want it to be a two-parter, or if there are ways of avoiding some of the encounters.<br/><br/>EDIT: I play what most people seem to think of as short sessions - less than two hours.  You might want to double up, with an opportunity for rest in the middle, if you're planning a long session.  Resting inside a dungeon is a weird D&amp;Dism, but it can be kinda cool.  Otherwise, leaving the dungeon presents a cool opportunity for ambushes, or for things to have changed when they come back.  One time I ran a dungeon where the mass murder of so many orcs led to the overthrow of the chief by his sorcerer adviser.

One of my often-run, short but generally  okay, dungeons might (depending how you go through it) go:<br/><br/><i>Short exploration, Staged fight, Long Exploration (with trap, possible very minor skirmish), Staged fight, Puzzle room, Straight run, Boss fight, wrap-up.</i><br/><br/>-Making exploration good, <b>for me</b>, is not about "which way do you go".  It's about "when is the DM going to throw a quick engineering curve ball (trap/puzzle room)our way?  And what's here that we can take advantage of when he does?"; I note that this requires a certain mindset from the players.<br/><br/>-Good puzzles, in my experience, are very simple, but require a little running around from room to room (see the Zelda reference right at start).<br/><br/>-Simon already described good fight encounters.

I was very surprised at just how "sparse" the original Ravenloft module is for having such a gigantic castle map.  Although, I realize that Strahd isn't meant to be the "big bad" at the end.

Available from Paizo, I'm sure.  My brother and I took two characters each (3rd level) into the Lost City and only two got out - but they were 7th level when they emerged - and were richer than Croesus.<br/><br/>I like Levi's timeline, and I followed something similar when I made my own dungeons, with a bit more exploration involved.  I always liked conjuring environments for my players, so I'd spend a lot of time making those environments not only memorable (like White Plume Mountain), but mechanically interesting as well.

Reading some samples is going to give you a very 1 dimensional idea of what a dungeon is. Tomb of Horrors and White Plume Mountain both occupy one extreme end of what a dungeon is. Both are very good examples of that style (though very old ones). <br/><br/>For reading, I suggest you read Keep on the Borderlands. It's a very fine example of a different style of dungeon. It's also meant specifically to introduce both game master and players to dungeons. It will probably make a lot more "sense" to you. Tomb and White Plume both make a lot of assumptions about what comprises a dungeon and what style of play you're aiming for.<br/><br/>Finally, get a good DM to run basic D&amp;D for you a few times. It doesn't matter where they get their dungeon from. This will show you the dungeon as a factor of actual play. That's what a dungeon really amounts to.

It's because they were fan-made, and people sent the dungeon they had played with their group. They were also father difficult to use for every gaming group, you would need a specific party mix of classes and levels, or you had to customize it.<br/><br/>Then you brought the "official" modules, and they were crap, with "story hooks" of the class of "you are standing in a tavern when a hooded stranger offer gold to an adventuring party who...". I remember a module written by Ed "Mr Forgotten Realms" Greenwood where, if the party didn't accept to go to a certain city, they had to be kidnapped by a band of streets bandits in full plate (no, I am not making this stuff up...) and taken to that city...<br/><br/>Really. A load of crap. Take the "desert of desolation" series. You played for months, only to see at the end a NPC fight the final battle while you look inside a bubble.<br/><br/>All this, while people who played Runequest had modules like "Griffin Mountains" or "Borderlands", that are still full of problem when you see them from our vantage point, but at least made sense.<br/><br/>I think that people recently had shown nostalgic thoughts for the "old dungeons" only because they didn't play many of them at the time.

And that's often what I found good DMs would do - they'd take those dungeons and make them the group's own.</blockquote>\nI agree with this approach.<br/><br/>As a DM, this is what I always do. I think on a story, then think on a locale, then draw my maps, then think on a way to "link" the different pieces toghether, then fill them up with cool monsters. (Yup. I'd link the pieces <b>before </b>thinking on monsters.) That way we do have those links that make the dungeon feel like more than a random monsters cache rolled at some random generation tables.<br/><br/>BTW, I <b>HATE</b> empty, pointless, dead end rooms. Maybe there is no monster, trasure or trap in all of them, but I try to give each one some color, details, logic and even a history. So this room is not an empty random 10x10 room. It is a kitchen, full of old and rusty cooking implements. And there is a working table stained with countless substances (whether they are "chicken" blood or not is debatable). There is an old coal oven, full of ashes and the long forgotten pan lying there... Sure, it doesn't offer much to the players or to the characters (no big fight, no new shinies, no over convoluted plot advancement), but they have proven to be way more fun than "an empty room, 10x10, with two doors at each side".<br/><br/><br/>This one time my brother was DMing us. And he was kind of eager to get a taste of "good" old classical dungeoncrawl. So he set us up to be close to the <i>House of Stone </i>(a misterious and legedary, even if mostly unknown, dungeon in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting).<br/><br/>None of us had any true reason to adventure there. Efectively we had just finished our last quest and were kind of without anything better to do at the time. So he actually made up something interesting for each of us, located in one of the many levels of the dungeon. An axe for the Dwarven barbarian, a Book of Forbiden Lore for the maleficent sorcerer, a long lost shrine of my Ranger/Cleric's God... You get the picture.<br/><br/>It was the most frustrating, overcomplicated, pointless crawl I have ever experienced. My <i>cute </i>little brother made it so that each time we moved from one level to another, everything randomly changed (including the walls). So our maps were pretty much useless afterwards. In fact if it took us too long, the walls would randomly move anyway every 3 days. Even dead monsters would respawn (I actually had an argument with him over this). The first 3 levels were piece of cake. In the next one my character died. Twice. And most of the others were pretty close. We only got saved when my brother railroaded the situation after we tried to face the bad old black dragon (after cheeringly ignoring every piece of warning that was thrown to us), and he made the evil wizard who had been manipulating us save our asses.<br/><br/>So we had wasted about 6 weeks of gaming time, we spent about 5 sessions playing the goddamin dungeon, and not even one of us ever reached the big treasure each one coveted.<br/><br/>That was one of the best gaming times I have had in many years. Really fun and interesting. Since the dungeon itself was pretty lame and shapeless, we put the color in. We spent the time developing our characters, roleplaying, honing our gaming and tactical skills and complaining about the stupid confusing huge stone building. We swore we were getting back as soon as we leveled up enough.<br/><br/>(We never did. At the time our characters were about 12th level. My brother interrupted the campaign as we were reaching Epic level. My character had just reached 19th, and the highest level character was already 20th.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134275/#Comment_134275" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T01:37:05+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  1:37AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2008 1:37AM by Hituro.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just finished running a 4 session dungeon in GURPS<br/><br/>It centered around an abandoned mining complex which had been destroyed by a catastrophic fire 2 decades before, and which was still smouldering (Silent Hill style). The party was seeking their wizard companion, who had vanished in a shipwreck. They know that his old master used to live in a tower atop the mountain with the mine in, and thought that in desperation he might have teleported back here, but then gotten into serious trouble, since he had not reappeared.<br/><br/>They discovered that there was still a small mining community eaking out a living from open cast mines, and various treacherous mine shafts. Then they were attacked by Goblins, who kidnapped one of the miners children. This caused them to rush into the mines (previously they had been cautiously probing them), with he miners to get him back. They confronted and skirmished with the Goblins, but discovered that they lived in fear of a creature deeper in the mountain to which they had sacrificed their own children, before turning to humans, and agreed to try and defeat the monster in return for guidance and safe passage.<br/><br/>The main part of the dungeon, below the goblin warrens, was tunnels excavated by the wizard, full of hazards where the fire and earthquake that accompanied the wizard's death had smashed floors, collapsed tunnels and the like (with great thanks to a cool guidebook I picked up to the copper mines of conniston). Lots of traversing, abseiling, crawling down shafts and the like. This took them to a big obstacle (a smoke filled crevasse) which took a while to pass and then into a min-level where they faced acidic slimes in small smooth tunnels, and tangled with the beast (well ran away from actually). This led to an abandoned lab, more tunnels, lots of sneaking, and then another confrontation with the beast on a ledge in a vast cavern (the beast proved to be a haywire golem).<br/><br/>They fled again into a temple complex excavated by forces unknown at the deepest levels, where the dead wizard had worshipped an evil artefact he had found (which the party have encountered a number of times). Here they found their wizard unconcious on a slab, the artefact, and the boy in a cage. This was the setting for a final fight with both the golem and the artefact (possessing the body of another wizard who had gone in search of the missing one).<br/><br/>It went down very well, so I can only assume that all the context and logic made it good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134297/#Comment_134297" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T07:06:00+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  7:06AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2008 7:12AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I KNEW IT!<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew that from your other post there was something wrong. Some disconnect. And this is it. You just don't understand what a "dungeon" is, or how they got started. Oh, I'm sure you've heard the historiography, but let's recap:<br/>\n<br/>\n - Gygax makes Miniatures rules that will some day become Chainmail.<br/>\n - Arneson creates the original one-player-to-one-figure dungeon *scenario*. His inspiration is obviously Moria. <br/>\n - D&amp;D is born, as the titles say on the covers of the books, as a miniatures wargame. (If you don't believe me about the cover, see here: http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showbook&amp;bookid=2469)<br/>\n - Gygax starts thinking that there could be a semi-realisticly presented world that exists between scenarios. That you can "play" the characters between scenarii. His publications start heading this way. But won't get there until AD&amp;D. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you play miniatures at all? Or other wargames? I play Warhammer 40K regularly. When we set up to play, we decide on how many points to play, and which teams each side will use, and what the victory conditions are. Playing Apocalypse recently, the victory conditions are to have the majority control of six positions on the game table. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think that we even bother to describe where the fight is occuring? Or what the victory positions represent? Or even why the fight is happening? No, it's WH40K, and somebody is fighting a fight like this somewhere for some reason, and we simply don't care. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's because it's a game, not what we think of now as RPG. Almost all early D&amp;D play was wargame. If you read the Basic D&amp;D text, for instance, you'll find that there's this concept of "town" which is the place where characters go between dungeons to rest and get new equipment. Basically there's zero indication that you are to play out town, it's just a hit point reset, and an opportunity to spend treasure on new equipment. And "Town" is an evolution from Original D&amp;D, in which you just healed and got equipment between sessions with no explanation. Pass GO, collect 200$. <br/>\n<br/>\nDungeons, as scenarii, quite simply had little to no rationale put forth. The rationales in the modules you mention are actually quite sophisticated, compared to most play where folks didn't even bother to have ANY rationale. The characters are going to a dungeon - why? Because the game is Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It's like asking why does the little shoe go around the board in Monopoly... because that's how you play the game. "Character Motivations?" The characters have personality? Why? What's that for? They're just a pile of numbers on a sheet that tell you how good the character is at hacking up the monsters in the dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want a real taste, check out Module B1 "Into the Unknown." It is absolutely the clasic model for dungeons from to which all others can be geneologically traced. It's "premise" is that it was built by a warrior and a mage named Rogan and Zelgar (or sumptin), who have since disappeared, only to be replaced by monsters. Enter the characters to obtain the various treasures of the place. Note this carefully: each room has a brief description, and then has two openings on it for the GM to fill in that look like this...<br/>\n<br/>\nMonster:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTreasure:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, they don't even bother putting in the creatures or treasure. Why? Replayability, of course! How can you use it repeatedly, if the monsters are the same each time, and you always know where the best treasure is located (hmmmm, World of Warcraft... hmmm)? No, the monsters change each time, and the treasure, with no explanation of why or how this could happen. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause we don't need an explanation. Its the dungeon. It's the place in which the wargaming scenarios occur. It doesn't have to make any sense. It just has to give us an opportunity to hack monsters, and cast spells. <br/>\n<br/>\nRead that copy of "Keep on the Borderlands." Now realize that the rules there for "wilderness adventuring" did not exist prior to this module. Because nobody ever went anywhere but "town" and the dungeon. See the evolution of thought? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that Gygax very slowly morphed D&amp;D into something else over the next 10 years, is an interesting part of the history. But you have to remember, then, that he was adjusting his own wargaming canalization, and having to deal with a culture built by him and Arneson from 1974 to 1979. Instead of presenting a whole new game, he was "converting" the wargamers over. Which meant is was all incremental. Like...<br/>\n<br/>\n"Hey, you should have the economics of the world work sensibly... like if a lot of money comes out of a dungeon, this will affect prices of equipment." <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's still a wargaming mentality, just adjusted for economics. Yes, by 1980, there's this budding idea in the heads of many GMs, fostered by some articles from the Dragon magazine, that, in fact, players should actually "roleplay" their characters, as in having the characters act not as pawns of the player, but as thought they had their own motivations. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134298/#Comment_134298" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T07:06:15+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  7:06AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2008 7:09AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn hindsight, I know that there was some sort of change that occured in my own thinking on this, and I had gone from wargamer, to what we now think of as RPG player at some point. The fascinating thing is that I, and many others, expected that all players would just automatically see the same potential, if we just presented a full world, where not only "Town" existed, but the characters could go anywhere, and do anything in the wide world of the maps that we provided them. <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead, many simply saw the world maps as a great big planet-spanning dungeon. After all, we still rolled for senseless wandering monster rolls when travelling across terrain in AD&amp;D. And other such wargaming artifacts. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, all along, and definitely exploding in the mid 80s, there were groups that were starting up using newer games that began with the "roleplaying" ethic. The idea that the world was a full place, and not just put there to support dungeons. Oh, somehow they each had a rationale for having scenarii, called "Adventures." But it was heading to what we know today. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut lots and lots of players never left that Basic D&amp;D mode of play. In fact I know a lot of them. Probably more of them than I know Story Gamers. Oh, they're probably in the minority now. But the majority is probably made up of groups where "Adventures" don't have to have a lot of rationale, though we also play the characters as though they had real motivations. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd posit that this is a very difficult sort of play, but that's an argument for a different thread. But the point is that, even if they are "roleplaying" as we think of it, they do so with extremely heavy-handed arrangement of play where everybody knows that every night it's going to be back into some hole in the ground. Or the like. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if you're having trouble getting your head around this ideal of play, but it's what a lot of people consider to be RPG play. For every one of us who Poo-poos their lack of "Real" roleplaying, there's one of them that is bemoaning how many folks have gone over to the "Fruity" sort of play that we do. They're out just playing a game, killing stuff. We actually play out the emotions of our characters? What the fuck? How is that even a game? <br/>\n<br/>\nWe exhort: Stop playing games! <br/>\nAnd they retort: Stop gaming plays!<br/>\n<br/>\nExpecting that the materials that they produce to make any sense for our sort of play... just won't work. It's a very different sort of activity on a very fundamental level. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not to say that you're Don Quixote in my book, trying to find a rationale for dungeons for your game. But you won't find it in early D&amp;D modules. Not by a longshot. I'd suggest staying away from the later "good" stuff, too. Temple of Elemental Evil, and Underworld, etc - while way more "middle ground" than the early modules you cite - are still vastly different than what you have come to expect from RPG materials. They still assume that the characters are in a "party" and that the players should work to keep the party together, so as to keep the action going. Action before roleplay. Roleplay is something you do during downtime, don't let it get in the way of actually playing the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically the best you'll get out of those materials is that everyone should simply agree to the central conciet of the dungeon before hand, and go with it. The Archduke needs you to go into the Temple? OK, in you go. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot at all what you're looking for. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... yes... to answer your question. All dungeons are this sucky. For this purpose (for some they're the awesome). Any exceptions that exist, only serve to prove the rule. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134306/#Comment_134306" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T07:26:11+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  7:26AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MIke's comments aside, Keep on the Borderlands should, as far as I know, be cited as the beginning of all future alignment flame wars, so perhaps there is a little more something in there.<br/><br/>I'd also be curious about the attitudes of people based on when they started playing these games.

I also remember recruiting a fair number of new players in thw early 90s when the whole WoD was ramping up, and there were definitely noticable differences between the way my old time D&amp;D buddies played and the way the newer WW gamers played..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134308/#Comment_134308" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T07:33:58+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  7:33AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            White Plume Mountain ended my interest in D&amp;D, back in the day.

Its like a dungeon, but with the rooms replaced with a strike on a corporate enclave, a random betrayal, a gun fight in a poor neighborhood, and hours long scenes where the decker solves puzzles in the middle. The point of it is to have the group work together using their skills and resources to overcome a series of challenges in order to get to the desired victorious ending. That Shadowrun style adventures make more sense than Dungeons is because they hid the walls and so had to replace them with some kind of logic and causality. There needed to be a reason the fixer turned on you, where the only reason you needed to go into the next dungeon room is that you went through the door. But even then, if you watch, a lot of those early Shadowrun adventures seem to decide to have the fixer betray you first, and then figure out why later. <br/><br/>So anyway, we play our first couple of sessions and everything goes okay. Then we hit Queen Euphoria (I think), and suddenly shit starts going wrong. Or right. Or something. One of the PCs falls in love with the girl they were kidnapping, and decides to run off with her away from the rest of the team. They end up in a gun fight, and he ends up coming back to them only after the mage uses a spell to make the girl tell him she didn't love him and was just using him. Then when the girl is later in trouble and the PCs are supposed to noble knight to the rescue, he refuses. <br/><br/>Next we do Dreamchipper, and things get even worse. Or better. We get nowhere near the end of the written adventure, because all of a sudden two of the players (the mage and the dude who ran off with the girl the adventure before) suddenly have no interest in working together, or completing this mission. So they start plotting with Cleopatra and Genghis Khan, and I have to step in and railroad their asses back into working together as a team to complete the mission. Because that's what the damn game was about. <br/><br/>Except it wasn't anymore. <br/><br/>About two years later we got into Vampire, and our first thing was a mission completion adventure. It didn't work well at all, and we went back to Shadowrun and D&amp;D for a good time. Because at least we knew what they were about. Except, of course, they weren't anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134310/#Comment_134310" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T07:41:44+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  7:41AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that's just been touched on a little...<br/><br/>"Wandering monsters" are also a key part of "old fashioned dungeons."<br/><br/>That's right, monsters which did not exist until the DM rolled them up randomly on a table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134313/#Comment_134313" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T07:56:44+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  7:56AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked White Plume Mountain quite a bit, although I converted it to Savage Worlds for my Savage Fantasy game and modded it somewhat.

I mean, back in the day, we played<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>and<em>GURPS: Fantasy</em>. So we strayed closer to crime-fighting or continent-spanning epics. So I went online and found:<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/oa/20051031a" rel="nofollow">Tomb of Horrors</a>andWhite Plume Mountain, which are available as free PDFs.<br/><br/>And I read them.<br/><br/>So, um... are all D&amp;D dungeons this lame? I mean, this shit makes no sense whatsoever!<em>Tomb of Horrors</em>ends with a complete anticlimax after the GM basically tortures the players for not having read the adventure before playing.<em>White Plume Mountain</em>has chamber after chamber filled with random monsters and guards who are guarding dead ends. What the hell?</blockquote>\nThese modules were both originally designed as <i>tournament</i> modules (i.e., for play at conventions and such). They're not designed to make a lot of sense but, rather, to showcase, in a limited window of time, what the authors considered to be key selling points of a then (largely) new entertainment medium and the AD&amp;D system in particular. Much like convention scenarios for most other RPGs. <br/><br/>Holding up these specialized scenarios as representative of the milieu (or D&amp;D) is unfair and skews things more than a bit based on oversight of the information that I impart above. Doing so is an old, tired, and well known troll in online D&amp;D communities. I'm not certain that you're utilizing it in that manner but, given the recent-ish need of several Indie game fans and designers to celebrate the passing of Gary Gygax by unfairly criticizing D&amp;D in his absence, I'm exercising caution. <br/><br/>If you're simply about criticizing D&amp;D, there are literally hundreds of <i>valid</i> faults with the system -- please choose one of those to vent your frustrations on. If you genuinely have no exposure to D&amp;D and want to know if two old-ish convention modules are representative of the typical D&amp;D dungeon crawl. . . well. . . I think I've already answered that question (to be clear, though, no -- such modules are not representative of the typical D&amp;D dungeon crawl).<br/><br/>[Edit: Incidentally, if you're genuinely this unfamiliar with the classic dungeon crawl milieu, I respectfully suggest that you may want to <i>become</i> familiar with it before you attempt to emulate it.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134369/#Comment_134369" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T11:01:14+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 11:01AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite><br/>"Well, sure, but it's not like this stuff just<i>went away</i>.

They roleplay (in Mike's sense) all the time, if they are in a dungeon then it is, like I said above, all about the why, but they are still gaming the dungeon as well. They are going down the mine to rescue a friend, but they explore the twisty passages because that's what you do in a dungeon and they like that                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Are Dungeons Always This Lame? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6004/are-dungeons-always-this-lame/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Are Dungeons Always This Lame? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6004/are-dungeons-always-this-lame/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Levi, 100% yes.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Levi, 100% yes. That is, this is, as I said, the most common form, currently, I think. That said, I still know people for whom any characterization at all is just not part of play. Zero. No first person play occurs at all. Zero. All play, for these folks, is in the mode of, "Hmm. What can I as the player do here to win this scenario?"<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I came into one such group, and made a character and played, they were all completely befuddled by the way I played. They adjusted admirably around it. But did not participate. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps not common any more, but such games exist. As you say, the more common level is gaming the dungeon, and occasional spurts of characterization layed on top. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, those are tournament modules, but... if you're going to suggest that somehow the Village of Omlette is somehow supportive of roleplaying, all I can do is to give you the recapitulation of what my players did with it. They killed everyone in the Omlette. Why? Because, well, while the module didn't tell you what the NPCs were like at all, other than their class and level and hits, it did tell you those things, and, it told you how much treasure each NPC had. So... it's an outdoor dungeon, right? We just kill everyrthing like any other dungeon, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, really. OK, we're playing AD&amp;D, and the characters have alignments like lawful good. The first time they attack a villager, I get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach... this isn't how this is supposed to go, is it? I stop and ask the players... isn't it kinda evil to do this? They look at me with blank stares. And then decide to do it anyhow. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? Because they had absolutely no other idea of how to interact with the game world. Talk to an NPC? Characters can talk? Where does it say that? Huh. Do you get EXP for talking to them? <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I'd played wargames before this... got my start in "adventure gaming" with Panzerblitz, in fact, at age 6. But, again, I as GM knew that there was something wrong. The other players, most of them had NEVER played a wargame. They were simply responding to looking at their character abilities, how they had played D&amp;D before (if at all), and made the assumption that the only way a town would be any fun is if they just looked at it as just another module. In fact, it's in one of them there moduly folders. Must be a dungeon. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me put it this way: all of the content of the module is wargaming notes, except for a few that speak about who knows where the "real dungeon" is outside of town and slim facts like that. Why do I need to know Ostler Grundigoot's level? What's the purpose of it being in the notes? Well, it's there "in case" he ends up in a fight somehow with somebody. I mean we have to cover that potential possibility, right? That's what the D&amp;D mechanics do...<br/>\n<br/>\nForget the Hamlet of Hommlet. Let's flash forward to the 90s. I purchase an Al Quadim module, actually part of a boxed set. Ah... Arabian Nights... look at the beautiful and evocative artwork. Surely within this box is setting information that's sure to be good as the start of stories. Right? The "Module" within has a classic map layout, like Hommlet. That is, you learn about the place by looking at the map, wondering what that building is, and reading the numbred entry. In which you get the combat stats. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, but wait, there's more! This has "roleplaying" in it. That is, obviously we're not meant to kill of the encounters. Well, sure, thre's the random demon here and there sprinkled in just so that we won't go too long without a combat, but most of the numbered encounters are listed like, <br/>\n<br/>\n1. PCs talk to dude. He sends them over to other dude at 2.<br/>\n2. This dude tells them that he needs them to guard caravan. If the PCs say yes, then he directs them to location 3 to get equipped. If they say no, then screw the players for being uncooperative bastards. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, yes, we're no longer in the dungeon. But it's just as scripted as any tournament module. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre there exceptions? I'm sure there are. But, again, they just prove the rule. There is no comparison between an Al Quadim module and, say, the Delta Green sourcebook. The former gives you a script to play through. The latter gives you ideas from which you can form play in any way that you like. <br/>\n<br/>\nDungeons are easy - following a script makes it rather foolproof. But that doesn't mean that it's good for other forms of RPG play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBrand... that's poetic. My play started going south with D&amp;D in 1980. All my fault, really, I just could no longer stomach another "Massacre at Hommlet." I wasn't able to get the idea across of how I thought play was supposed to go. I'm sure folks will blame it on the fact that I was only 12 years old at the time, and playing with other kids. But I knew what the problem was, it was the dang system. I tried to fix it. Didn't work. I tried using other systems. Didn't work. I created my first homebrew system at age 14. That didn't solve the problems. I finally decided that it must be the fault of the players. They just didn't get it. Nothing I do with the system can make it realistic enough to make the players have their characters act realistically.<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, that's what I thought the solution was. Rolemaster. That's so realistic and dangerous, that players can't do things like leap off of cliffs knowing it won't do enough damage to kill them (they could roll a high crit and die!). If the dangers are real, then they'll FEEL their character's plights, and, well, have the chracters act like it. <br/>\n<br/>\nNope. I recall one situation in which the players encountered a new PC, and immediately adopted him. "Why?" I asked. "Because he's got three dimensions. He's obviously not an NPC." This is 1994 now. I call them to task for playing with player knowledge that the characters do not have. So the next time they encounter another PC, what do they do? They kill him. "Why?" I ask. "Because he was acting suspiciously. It was the realistic thing to do." <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I almost gave up on RPGs. I blamed myself. I am a bad GM. I do not make the world realistic enough, so the players don't get their characters. And I blamed them... they should try harder! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I found out that, know what? Modules inform play a lot! If you present "dungeons" to players, and killing is what play is about, then they'll play to win, and kill everything. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut wait!... if you play "situations..." Ones that center around the characters in play? <br/>\n<br/>\nHappily ever after. :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134390/#Comment_134390" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T11:52:50+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 11:52AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike:<br/><br/>Stole a bunch of your ideas here, rewrote in my own words while spackling them together with my own.

This was a Monday evening "blow off your work frustrations by whacking some ogres" game with minimal roleplaying -- my character <i>had</i> a name, but he was referred to way more often as "Dwarf #2". But despite all that, we never approached the game in any kind of "kill everything that moves" mode. That's because gaming the dungeon often meant that it didn't make <i>sense</i> to go on a killing spree when the more sound tactic was to befriend helpful NPCs, interrogate captured prisoners about the dangers ahead, etc. <br/><br/>Maybe it was because play wasn't so much about <i>killing</i> as it was <i>beating the dungeon.</i> Sure, killing stuff was <i>often</i> the way to beat the dungeon, but certainly not always.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134403/#Comment_134403" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T12:19:16+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 12:19PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2008 12:20PM by Stuart.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Hammack</cite><br/>Maybe it was because play wasn't so much about<i>killing</i>as it was<i>beating the dungeon.</i>Sure, killing stuff was<i>often</i>the way to beat the dungeon, but certainly not always.</blockquote>\nThis is how we've played D&amp;D and really all other RPGs since we started back in the 80s.

Don't you. And manage to do it coming off as condescending as hell. <br/>\n<br/>\nNice work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read every single "Choose your own adventure" book ever written (as far as I know). You completely missed the point where I say that it wasn't that I didn't know the other way to play. It was entirely that I didn't know how to get players to understand that mode of play. And that's because I didn't know how to characterize at all myself, too. If I had bothered to actually play Grundigoot in a more three-dimensional way when he was encountered (I did roleplay him, as I recall), he might have survived. But there was nothing in that module that gave me, at least, any idea of how to do this. To say nothing of giving me any other information that I could use to persuade the players that play was about anything else than killing folks. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when I say "killing," come on. I mean, "Killing folks if you can get away with it, and otherwise finding a way around them if you figure that you can't do so." What I'm saying is that it's tactical play, and most importantly, that the players are thinking of their characters as pawns in the game. Not as characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm in no way suggesting that my experience is universal. Nor that somebody couldn't have gotten more out of Homlett than I did. I'm sure lots of people did. For whatever reason. But the point is that just because you had one experience, and I another, doesn't  mean that mine is unusual. We don't have any scientific data on this, no, but I recall in some thread a couple of years back discussing just this sort of play and my example of Homlett came up. More recently there have been threads here by people who have asked things like, "Why are my players psychopathic?" <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the fact is that it's because D&amp;D taught us to play that way. Because it WAS a wargame. To start. And the modules, unless you're squinting at it with a lot of enculturation that says it's something else, do not inform one of anything else that I recall. I actually still have that module I think (it somehow avoided the blaze of '81). I'll have to go back and check it again. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, let's say, for argument's sake, that it actually does have tons of delightful characterization information, and notes on how it can be well run. That still doesn't explain why my players reacted the way they did. And that's because earlier modules like B1 had burnt into their heads a certain mode of play.

We'd butchered off everyone and everything before, but there was a time when we hit TMNT that that started changing. In TMNT the characters suddenly had allies -- not really because of the rules but because of April O'Neel -- and once that happened I had to start figuring out how to make NPCs actually do something. We got lots of damsels in distress, sure, but we also got NPCs who could tell you the bad guy was in the Moathouse, and maybe one of them would tell you his weakness -- but only if you didn't piss them off and made your MA or PA roll. <br/><br/>For us the answer, in simple terms, was to make the NPCs part of the mission to be completed. Because we weren't so much about kill as about win, and NPCs being part of the win condition made sure they'd be important in the way NPCs in, say, Morrowind are important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134468/#Comment_134468" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T15:00:13+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  3:00PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballistic Roby</cite><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>Go read T1 Village of Hommlet to see a campaign dungeon.

I might be misunderstanding you, but are you criticizing it as a modern adventure?<br/><br/>I think it's fine to say that it doesn't follow today's design standards ("where is my timeline of events, bullet list of plot points and important characters the PCs should meet?!?") but it would be incorrect to say it wasn't a leap forward when it was released. It was a game that didn't start at the entrance of a dungeon, quite possibly the first town game. And while there aren't explicit "this guy will say this" if you read the lengthy introduction of the region it explains most of the questions you have (knowing the evil has returned and is hiding in the moathouse is in fact the big secret). But yes, it leaves it up to the DM to sort out how it all comes out, something modern adventures wouldn't do. The interesting thing is that the trend towards providing the GM literal revelations or events to follow in no small part leads to railroad games (not necessarily, but it's a pitfall along the path of evolution).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134470/#Comment_134470" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T15:07:41+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  3:07PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was Call of Cthulhu that weaned us off the "kill everyone" game - if you killed everyone there, you had no game.<br/><br/>It was Vampire that weaned us off the "you win if you get the most XP and treasure" game - if you did nothing, kept yourself safe, and lied better than the person who got the most XP and treasure, you could get them killed at no risk to yourself and win.<br/><br/>(We were kind of dumb.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134475/#Comment_134475" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T15:30:59+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  3:30PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as the massacre of Hommlet goes, I get the "we're kids, we kill random villagers because we don't know any better" thing, but what's strange to me is that no low level party could do that in Hommlet and survive -- the local heavies would wipe you out.

He made an assassin, and he systematically (and cleverly, to give him props) murdered everyone in the town, because 1) that's how you got Experience Points in D&amp;D and 2) he was an assassin, and assassins killed people, right? I was a little disturbed by it, but not so much that I stopped playing. And my brother (who was never really much of a psycho, and has grown up to be one of the gentlest guys I know) got a kick out of outsmarting people and killing them in sneaky, elaborate ways. Plus, I wasn't really sure what else you were supposed to with the module--all the other D&amp;D modules were about killing things and taking their stuff, and this module appeared to be just a prelude to a larger adventure that didn't come out until long after I'd stopped playing D&amp;D and given up on modules.<br/><br/>I don't have any real conclusions, except that Mike and his players weren't alone in the "kill the villagers of Hommlet" game.<br/><br/>As for the dungeons I made myself, they were either designed around some wacky schtick (like "the Crystal Caves of Time &amp; Space," wherein the PCs could get control of crystalline, phone-booth-sized containers that would transport them to the past, the future, alternate dimensions, and other planets) or were completely random, with monsters and treasure from the random tables in the DM's Guide, with no thought whatsoever to "logic" or "backstory" or any larger context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134491/#Comment_134491" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T17:54:07+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  5:54PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it has anything to do with wargamers.  In 1974 when the original D&amp;D came out (and I was in junior high school), I was spending my weekends hanging out at the MIT Strategic Games Society.  We are talking about serious wargamers here, the sort that have boxes of WWII German armored figures or a regiment of British Fusiliers, the sort who played Avalon Hill and SPI boardgames with rulebooks that looked like technical manuals.  And from day one in any of those games, if we had randomly attacked town folk, we'd have been hunted down by the town guard, or the royal army or whatever organization it took, because even when there were dungeons (and all the early games had dungeons) there was no doubt that there was supposed to be a world out there outside the dungeon.<br/><br/>Mind you, we got started playing before there were any published modules.  Everyone came up with their own setting material (some from ideas from fantasy novels they someday intended to write), and by the time the first modules came out, they wouldn't have fit with the worlds people had created (and if if they'd been any use, we were too snobby to use them).  True, these worlds often had very silly elements like Little Old Ladies in Tennis Shoes as monsters, or the Acme Revenge Company ("We always get our man, even if she's an elf!"), but they also had a sense of there being a world there.  A few years later, in an event called (with deliberate irony) "The Great Cultural Revolution", most of the silly aspects were banished from most of the SGS games, and some really serious world building went on.  (The GM's for SGS games were also the crew who went on the found the APA <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Wild Hunt</span>.)<br/><br/>I wonder if it had more to do with the age of the players and GM's, since the crowd at the SGS were dominated by college students, grad students and alumni (there were obviously high school students and younger there, since I was, but we were in the minority).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134496/#Comment_134496" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T18:24:46+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  6:24PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Ballistic Roby</cite>So -- those with the play experiences -- it seems that the published materials gave you the content, but not the context, and it was up to you (primarily the DM, sometimes the players) to knit things together to the level of "story" that you wanted.

While we started with less than modules (we started with the 1977 Holmes Basic D&amp;D;, with Dungeon Geomorphs and Monster &amp; Treasure Assortment, not even B1), my campaign quickly flowed into using modules for 70% of our gaming. We never really played Tomb of Horrors, but we did use White Plume Mountain (the run of which wound up written up by Glen Blacow in the Wild Hunt since he occaisionally played in my game). The Village of Homlett was used for one failed run, about all I remember is one player playing a Houri (class from the White Dwarf) and trying to seduce everyone in town before the session collapsed, I don't think they ever made it to the moathouse. We did bits and pieces of town stuff (and Homlett was not the first experience with towns, Judges Guild's City State of the Invincible Overlord definitely preceeded Homlett), but not much. My experience with CSIO actually forms the basis for my feeling on taking D&amp;D; out of the dungeon - in my opinion, it really doesn't work. Oh, you can fudge things around and make it work, but eventually, the levelling system of D&amp;D; causes a logical breakdown when trying to fit it into a "world."<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now, I am in the process of creating one of those old school dungeons, complete with lack of purpose, because I think that's the best model for D&amp;D.; Sure, it's barely more than a wargame, yet it definitely is. Characterization does matter, not much, and certainly characters won't be torn with angst, but characters they will be, and the Lumpley Principle will be in effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, I found the later modules, where story was being introduced, to be uninteresting. I saw the railroad tracks needed to make "story" happen in that context.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134506/#Comment_134506" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T20:40:39+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  8:40PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back to the top...<br><br>We actually sat down and played through Tomb of Horrors last night.

This was a Monday evening "blow off your work frustrations by whacking some ogres" game with minimal roleplaying -- my character<i>had</i>a name, but he was referred to way more often as "Dwarf #2". But despite all that, we never approached the game in any kind of "kill everything that moves" mode. That's because gaming the dungeon often meant that it didn't make<i>sense</i>to go on a killing spree when the more sound tactic was to befriend helpful NPCs, interrogate captured prisoners about the dangers ahead, etc.<br/><br/>Maybe it was because play wasn't so much about<i>killing</i>as it was<i>beating the dungeon.</i>Sure, killing stuff was<i>often</i>the way to beat the dungeon, but certainly not always.<br/><br/>We ran through Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil recently. Now we usually play D&amp;D outside of large dungeons with a large amount of RP involved, but when the entire environment is basically dungeon we basically stopped bothering to RP and just hacked our way through as well as possible. And I concur with your assessment. Killing sprees in dungeons are what the designers expect you to do. If you really want to break a module, you just need to engage in some creative thinking, like allowing NPCs to join your side. After all, when they've seen you kill 80% of their friends without breaking a sweat, they're likely to stay very loyal to you. <br/>But my point is that the best way to game a hack and slash dungeon is often to refuse to engage solely in hack and slash play.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134566/#Comment_134566" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T07:43:42+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  7:43AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2008 7:45AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geomorphs...

A product that exists as essentially random room shapes that you cut out in chunks, and tape together to make up your dungeon. <br/>\n<br/>\nConsider the tables in the back of the AD&amp;D 1E DMG for random dungeon generation. What does that speak to in terms of there being a rationale to your dungeons? And random "stocking" tables for what monsters are there. Or the idea that deeper levels of a dungeon should have more powerful creatures? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a game, and a very fun one. Can you layer on "roleplaying" on top of it? Sure. And you can do that with Monopoly, too. Oh, OK, I'll admit that it's easier in D&amp;D, because you're not a shoe, you're a Dwarf. And other artifacts that surround play. But there's nothing in any of those modules that's informing anyone that the NPCs are anything other than just another challenge to overcome tactically. Even if that means talking to them, and not having any system to determine if you're successful, other than GM fiat. <br/>\n<br/>\nDamian, you find this to be a good thing? That the players get to add on their own layers to the game? How does the game support this? Especially modules? By getting out of the way? That is, you can always change any game system to play it how you like. But saying that this is a feature of that game system means that all game systems have that feature. It's not in any way unique to D&amp;D. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, again, it sounds very odd to me for somebody to say, "It supports this sort of play by not doing anything."

It's just that I can't credit a module for what you add to play that it does not show you how to add to play.

Sounds like the time we purchased land rights to the worthless rocky canyon where a hidden-entrance dungeon/fortress was located about a day's ride outside of Waterdeep. Then we held an open house and sold the place to the highest bidder. This was right after Stronghold Builder's Guide came out with prices for that sort of thing. <br/>Sigh.

Are we in a monster filled cavern? Yes ... okay one mode of play. Are we in a ballroom full of nobles we wish to impress? Yes ... okay another mode of play. Are we going back to the hometown I've not seen since I was drafted as a boy to learn if my mother is still alive? Yes ... okay yet another mode of play.<br/><br/>I'm not saying other modes of play do, or do not, work in any given RPG, just that modes can be switched for different scenarios. Of course that relates to the length of your game. A 50-100 session games is more forgiving of dropping into a variety of modes of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134590/#Comment_134590" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T10:01:43+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 10:01AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2008 12:46PM by ffilz.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>It's a game, and a very fun one.

And other artifacts that surround play. But there's nothing in any of those modules that's informing anyone that the NPCs are anything other than just another challenge to overcome tactically.

Perhaps it was the fact that the wargame involved players playing individuals. I'm sure the cooperative aspect of players vs. GM was part of it. I think another big element was that the game did encourage creative scenario creation, and creative responses. The ongoing aspect was a factor too.<br/><br/>But you're right, the modules did not really inform role playing.<br/><br/>Hmm, one thought I have for what the modules did was help bring the GM away from being adversary. A GM running a module was responsible for rulings, and interpretation, but not for creating situation. The players could not accuse the GM of creating a death trap. Perhaps this allowed the GM to be more open to cooperation with the players, more solidly enabling the Lumpley Principle.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134627/#Comment_134627" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T12:42:34+00:00" title="March 13, 2008 12:42PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Damian, you find this to be a good thing?

By allowing you a lot of room for change and adaptation, I get to use that dungeon for whatever story I have in mind. I might use the map and the baddies, but I don't have to break the pacing of my own story to include it in my game. I do not change the system a bit. I <b>add</b> to the system (the roleplaying and storytelling factors). And the rules give me room for doing just that.<br/><br/>I differentiate games like monopoly from games like D&amp;D. Sure you could add roleplaying aspects to monopoly. But you'd have to change the way rules work. (I'm talking about freedom in here. As in "what if my character would prefer to walk the opposite way around?".) And in D&amp;D some rules might not exist, but you are allowed to add them, and they don't change the system a bit. They only change the way you play it.<br/><br/>I prefer limits to prohibitions. "Yes, but..." to "No way, you can't". Sure my guy can jump from the highest tower. I am allowed to. I would probably get critically wounded and probably die by doing so, but there is no "you can't jump" rule. (BTW, that is why I prefer D&amp;D 3.x to AD&amp;D 2nd.)<br/><br/>Now, I am not saying that empty modules where the DM has to do all the work are good. I'm just saying that I <b>personally</b> prefer those.

I'm not saying that these modules don't have their uses. I absolutely loved killing party after party with the Tomb of Horrors. No roleplaying involved at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the thread title talks about dungeons being "lame." But it's in the context of the question of whether or not they can be used by story-gamers as material for their play. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, for that limited use, I'm arguing that he's right: they are lame for that. But that should surprise only Josh, as we all used em either for the hack-n-slash style that they do work for, or, like you, riffed off of em somehow, and understand in just what context they are NOT lame. That is, the designers made them for a particular purpose, and they're good for that. They're just not good for what Josh wishes they were good for. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's very much as though Josh has said, "Man, I just can't get that old mainframe computer to run Halo. It's lame for that." To which one can only respond, well, sure, but it wasn't designed to do that. On the other hand, it does number processing very quickly, and is great for business applications.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what I'm trying to give Josh, some perspective on how people played when these modules came out, a mode that continues to be used today. And how the modules, while crappy for other modes, are unsurprisingly so, given that they aren't designed for those other modes. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI somehow missed Peter's post above, and I think he asks a good question. Was it that we were young? I'd posit that he's right, but that this speaks exactly to what I'm talking about. That is, these modules are so lacking in direction, that groups tend to take them wherever they might. All sorts of different directions. Being more of a blank slate than most, me and my friends, we didn't have any context to lay over these "Adventures." Whereas Peter's group had so much context that, when they looked at the contextless modules, they discarded them out of hand. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo for somebody like myself, the module wasn't informing play in any useful way. For somebody like Peter, it didn't inform him of anything he found useful in his RPG context. You, Damian, found it useful because you brought to it your own context that could make something of it. In all of these cases, the module simply isn't doing anything itself, other than acting as a tactical map. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134663/#Comment_134663" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T14:07:01+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  2:07PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed.

It certainly was a far cry from being a text that would support story-gaming ideas like player control of plot. But I'd have to give it credit for being a dramatic leap forward in technology for modules. And certainly made internal sense. Taken as a situation, and chucking the rails (which are pretty light guage as far as such stuff goes), it would be an example of something that has far more support for story-game play than something like Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure if it counts as a "dungeon" then, however. Yeah, the count's castle is "dungeony" and presented as numbered areas. But in practice I found that to be unneccessary to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually that represented a big change in my style of play. I mean, here I had this map, and to get from the entrance to Strahd's crypt, you had to go through a number of areas.

It's heavy-handed and primitive but as I recall it breaks players of thinking they can stomp into town and kill people randomly pretty quickly (at least it did back in 1980) which I think is very much part of T1's design: thinking you can just attack the villagers is a huge mistake, so it punishes people who bring hack-n-slash into town.</blockquote>\nYou make a good point.

You're accusing people of going with evidence of actual play, instead of ignoring what actually happened at the table in favour of what one might extrapolate from the rules text by itself, without play?<br/><br/>Which is a more valid basis for criticism: the text by itself, or the text <i>as actually read and used by real people</i>? Certainly, anecdotal evidence is a poor substitute for widespread scientific review, but it's still a huge step up from 'what I think should happen, based on this unapplied theory (the game rules)'. The whole foundation of most contemporary game criticism is that the game text itself is only really important insofar as it is implemented at the table, or otherwise affects how people actually play.<br/><br/>If everyone reads your rules that say 'killing is bad' and yet they go and play the game and kill everyone? That's important news, and worth discussing. It might even be worth discussing why your rules text may have encouraged that behaviour (as people in this thread are doing.)<br/><br/>Not to get in the way of defensiveness, of course, but that quote was just bizarro-world to me. I agree this thread has some of the feeling you discuss, but it really has nothing to do with how people are foolishly citing their actual play instead of merely reading the game text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134738/#Comment_134738" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T19:03:18+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  7:03PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>Which is a more valid basis for criticism: the text by itself, or the text<i>as actually read and used by real people</i>?</blockquote>\nUm, seriously?

We were around 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters were obviously people, from the beginning.  But the interesting parts of their lives were the Adventure.  Think the kid at the beginning of <i>The Princess Bride</i>.  "Is this a kissing book?"  "Killed by Pirates is good!"<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; of that era was an incomplete framework.  There is the game as it is written, and there is the game as it was played.  These are not the same things for most gamers of that era -- some people played the letter of the rules, most did not.  Some groups started exclusively with "alright, you start at a set of steps, leading down", while others started with you all the way back in town at The Inn(tm).  Some people had their dungeons in a world -- but they didn't start there, unless they were joining a pre-existing group.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, what happened was you started with the rulebook.  And an intro adventure/module/dungeon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, you had played it.  You could make your own (if, say, your dad was a Civil Engineer and had graph paper handy), because it was <i>easy</i>.  You draw a map.  Then you put monsters in it.  Then you start playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, once you'd made your own adventures, if you got a new module, it got tacked on.  But, somewhere in here, you bought an issue of Dragon.  Or White Dwarf.  Or you got the Greyhawk module.  Oh, look.  You draw a *bigger* map and put all the dungeons onto that map.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we knew about those maps, too, from LotR.  So that was easy, too.  We could do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, maps had towns.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you joined a group somewhere on this trajectory, you learned about towns and cities and everything, and then were surprised when you read the rules and didn't see all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were starting with a group all of whom were 'virgin' to gaming -- which is what happened to me -- you went through some or all of this evolution collectively, slowly accreting technique and ideas, with occasional injections from the wider culture (ie, magazines &amp; modules) or from other gamers you met -- new kids in school who moved up from the big city, or whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, in the early 80s, there were already other games.  RuneQuest.  Traveller.  Tunnels &amp; Trolls.  Champions.  Gamma World.  All with slightly different ideas of what a character was, what an "adventure module" looked like, and with products which contained all those slightly different ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus we started devouring fantasy books, if we weren't already.  Plus we went and saw <i>The Dark Crystal</i> or <i>Time Bandits</i> or whatever, and found more raw material.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of those different sources of ideas cross-polinated with D&amp;D;, at least in my group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game, the modules, and the idea of dungeon crawling itself, were all sort of frameworks on which to get together and make stuff up.  Everybody in the group DMed.  We'd rotate.  "Ooo, I had a great idea for a dungeon," and off you'd go to map it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, most gaming groups of that early "second gen" era were a mix of this sort of slow cross-polination and internal creativity, and the internal group collective idea of what the game was trumped what the rules said it was in a curious way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started with the game as written, but slowly drifted off, finding our own collective manner of play, using bits of skeletons from whatever we had available that appealed to us.<br/>\n<br/>\nShrug.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dungeon module, in my gaming group, was there to supplement the group, not to define the experience.

Traveller is interesting because as a SF game it would seem to have less affinity initially to the idea of the dungeon: where was our Moria for SF to use as inspiration. But go and look at some of the earliest Traveller modules out there like Shadows/Annic Nova and you will see that they are dungeons. The dungeon format is preserved through the expedient of the exploration of alien ruins. Later modules are often little more than the descriptions of starships, The Kinunir, and bases, Research Station Gamma and Twilight's Peak, and reasons for the player's to go there. You might see this as the Alien mode of play (where both movies are effectively SF dungeon crawls). A lot of play focused on this 'explorer' trope.<br><br>Twilight's Peak was interesting because it picked up on the tramp freighter mode of play. You have a ship but meeting the payments is not easy so you need to take on other jobs to supplement the money you get from shipping passengers and goods. For me this changed with 76 patrons. This supplement was filled with proto-bangs. A situation, devoid of place and time, that could be thrust at the players. The dying man that thrusts the note into your hands, the kidnapping on the steps of your hotel. Most had one or two suggested plots behind the events but the play style was all about improvisation for many groups. I guess that these 'patron encounters'  became the equivalent of D&amp;D's 'town' play often taking place in Starttown, the ubiquitous Mos Eisley style settlement, surrounding a starport.<br><br>A lot of these games saw the players on very gray sides of the law as mercenaries or smugglers. This is what I would call the Firefly era of Traveller games, because play tended to mirror an episode of that series, with attempts to make ends meet constantly jeopardized by double-cross or bad intelligence. Other strands were straight military adventures as mercenaries for the wargamers;a whole strand of Traveller play revolved around mercs. For many groups though the star mercs route was often just one type of job that you might pick up to help pay the bills.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135114/#Comment_135114" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T13:35:44+00:00" title="March 16, 2008  1:35PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Stuart</cite>Because in Homlett there are other characters to talk to.</blockquote>\nI just got this weird image of the Dogs in Homlett...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135125/#Comment_135125" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-16T16:37:24+00:00" title="March 16, 2008  4:37PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was listening to rpgmp3's recording of their DitV session on Thursday / Friday.

Yes, definitely a change there that one gets from looking at the different presentation styles. Traveller might even have been first in this. There's a definite evolution "beyond the dungeon" and wilderness adventures that occured around 1980. Yeah, that's only 6 years after the advent of D&amp;D, and seems like a short while in retrospect. But it took another couple of years for the mode of play to sink in... at least for me and my group. <br>\n<br>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135205/#Comment_135205" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T10:03:47+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 10:03AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dana, thanks for that description.

That's what you <em>do</em> with GURPS: you build things.  So roleplaying, for me, has always been a matter of building a world, building characters, building societies, building villains, building doomsday devices, and so on.  The "incomplete framework that allows/requires you to be creative to fill in the blanks" is a very alien viewpoint for me.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135233/#Comment_135233" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T12:44:34+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 12:44PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your statement seems somwhat contradictory, Josh.
