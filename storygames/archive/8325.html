It's about near-invincible women - spies, assassins, warriors and mystics - fighting to the death inside of The Complex. It's filled with flashbacks to moments of love and truth and conflict. It's filled with action.<br/><br/>I want to know: What are your favourite movies about chicks who are (A.) sexy beyond belief, (B.) deadly beyond belief, (C.) for the first time in their life caught up in the tumult of being human?<br/><br/>Feel free to give reasons, and especially to talk about the qualities that make girl in question memorable.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183806/#Comment_183806" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T17:52:58+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  5:52PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2008 5:54PM by John_Harper.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are no movies like this.

It has that problem where the woman has to take on a masculine role in order to be taken seriously. But the movie is kinda-sorta about that sad fact (if you squint at it). And Sharon Stone's "Lady" is utterly badass, and utterly human. She's memorable because she basically does a (very good) Clint Eastwood impersonation, but is also unmistakably female (the scene where she has to "dress pretty" for Gene Hackman is incredibly good).<br/><br/>(Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor in <i>Terminator 2</i> is a good example of the masculinized female hero. She's a badass, but she's mostly a badass because she has adopted stereotypical masculine traits. The woman we saw in <i>Terminator</i> is long gone.)<br/><br/>Mila Jovovich's "Alice" from the <i>Resident Evil</i> movies barely qualifies (she's not an embarrassment) but calling her a character is a stretch. Still, sexy + deadly, yep.<br/><br/>For much, much better examples see television: <i>Firefly</i>, <i>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</i>, <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> and <i>Xena: Warrior Princess</i>. Veronica Mars isn't deadly, but she should count, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183808/#Comment_183808" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T18:02:35+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  6:02PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another edge-case: Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft in the <i>Tomb Raider</i> movies.

She's deadly and sexy, but isn't portrayed as an always-available sexual object in the films (it's been a while since I saw them, so maybe I'm forgetting something). She doesn't get punished for daring to step outside her expected role, either (another common failing of Hollywood heroine movies).<br/><br/>She's a capable adventurer (whose support staff is all male) and she's taken seriously in the world of the movies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183811/#Comment_183811" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T18:12:37+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  6:12PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2008 6:14PM by Johnstone.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>There are no movies like this.

I mean, okay sure.. It's pretty typical, but I wouldn't say that it's universal. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just watched Mr. and Mrs. Smith last night. I think this is a great example. Jane Smith struggles with the duality of being a wife and a super-assassin. She's a woman who has to try to be cold when she watches her associates shred a bear she won when she first met her husband. <br/>\n<br/>\nSarah Conner from T2 is a good example of getting it wrong.. But she was a supporting character. The movie was about how an inhuman machine could maybe be more human, and how a boy without a father could turn to a machine as a father figure. Mom was there in support of that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it's a plus, IMO, if the movie or show demonstrates how the character has had to give up something of womanhood to be the badass she is, and demonstrates how this hurts. Sarah Conner did the former, but we saw none of the latter, and that's why it's an example of getting it wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n(edited because Chris Hearns did a better job of mentioning one of the movies I did)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183822/#Comment_183822" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T19:19:54+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  7:19PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>La Femme Nikita</i> (remade in the US as <i>Point of No Return</i>, but watch the original).<br/><br/>She's an attractive female assassin who is being human because she is a heroin addict who is forced to stop using and join the rest of the human race.<br/><br/>Mostly, I just wanted to offer this up because it's a movie that features what you are looking for and John said there wasn't any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183824/#Comment_183824" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T19:34:08+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  7:34PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            McGowan in Planet Terror is pretty badass.<br/>Xena?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

There are a lot of examples of movies that almost do this, or that think they're going to do this, and then just don't. Underworld, Ultraviolet, Aeon Flux, and the list goes on. As a result most of them suck as movies as well. (The other thing that happens is that some of the successful iterations are reduced to supporting character roll, and so don't quite get to be what they should. Like, say, Trinity from the Matrix. I always thought that movie would have been better if she'd been the One.) <br/><br/>Faster Pussy Cat, Kill, Kill is an interesting case. Varla was sexy deadly, but was as much the male fear of female violence as anything human, so even though I have to give her full props for hardcore, I can't quite give her full props for being an actual human. <br/><br/>The TV shows that quickly spring to mind have already been mentioned. There are also a handful of animated females who get at the role for me. John already touched on Eboshi. I'd also add Lady Oscar from The Rose of Versailles. She's sexy, if androgynous, a killer swordswoman, and through the series has to deal with both her gender and her class as a double one-two punch that has fucked her out of her ability to be happy. The way the series ends is troubling, but not necessarily bad. Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell also edges into this category, though the whole humanity issue is rather heavy handed at stake. (I have some memory of really liking Iria, but its been forever since I've watched it, so who knows?) <br/><br/>Comic books have some of the best examples, the Catwomen, Black Widows, Electras, and so forth. Almost all of them have problems in their history, but almost all of them also have at least one run where they're allowed to be awesome, deadly, and still human.

Any chick that can seduce a CIA super spy by kicking a guy to death in front of him is something sexy deadly, and the end of her story is certainly about her humanity -- though not always in the best of ways. And in fantasy land, Artesia is deadly sexy and human, and has a lot of orgies too. <br/><br/>I also have this feeling, like a word on the tip of my tongue, that I am missing some BIG IMPORTANT character of this type... but fucked if I can think it up right now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183833/#Comment_183833" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T20:53:00+00:00" title="December 16, 2008  8:53PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand,<br/><br/>The Major from Ghost in the Shell is the foundation of one of the character Archetypes in the game (The Perfect).

Not so much. <br/><br/>At least, that is, in the first two movies. I've not managed to force myself to watch the later movies, so in those she may well become the deadly part too.<br/><br/>But Pvt.

Which is often an issue when dealing with "super sexy" women in this type of genre.

The Action hero is a male role, because society does not risk its childbearing population to warrior's duties.  For any "deadly" characters, there has to be a warrior aesthetic and that is primary a male trait (by the gender roles theory of things).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184037/#Comment_184037" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T17:27:08+00:00" title="December 17, 2008  5:27PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "And other source material", you say. <br/><br/>I say: Read almost any book in the currently-almost-too-popular urban fantasy or supernatural romance genres. Kickass heroines wall to wall, I tell you, and most of them dealing with being human.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>Karen Murphy in Jim Butcher's <i><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/search/search?search_type=books&amp;search[query]=dresden+files" rel="nofollow">The Dresden Files</a></i>. A little, cute, blonde cheerleader type who's also a tough cop. Don't let the fact that she carries a little gun fool you. And caught up in the tumult of becoming human, oh, yeah.<br/><br/>Raine Benares in Lisa Shearin's <i><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/621697.Magic_Lost_Trouble_Found" rel="nofollow">Magic Lost, Trouble Found</a></i>. Member of an elf crime family, loves daggers, just got accidentally hooked up to a powerful evil artefact and is now sorcerously kickass beyond her wildest dreams (or wishes), and has to retain her humanity. Uh, elvenity. Whatever.<br/><br/>Joanne Walker in C.E. Murphy's <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/297929.Urban_Shaman" rel="nofollow"><i>Walker Papers</i></a>. An urban shaman dealing with the fact that she's sexy and kickass and human.<br/><br/>Patricia Briggs' <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/search/search?search_type=books&amp;search[query]=Mercedes+Thompson" rel="nofollow">Mercedes Thompson</a>, a coyote shapechanger and VW mechanic who kills a vampire and (if I recall correctly) a rapist. You could argue that she isn't struggling with being human, exactly, since she's not human, exactly, but she's definitely struggling with love and truth and conflict. <br/><br/>Joanne Baldwin, the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/search/search?search_type=books&amp;search[query]=Weather+Warden" rel="nofollow">Weather Warden</a> by Rachel Caine. It's a very, very bad idea to piss this woman off. She'll sic a hurricane on you. And yet at the same time it's almost chick-lit (complete with Manolo shoes). And struggling with humanity is in there too.<br/><br/>Occasionally in this genre (especially up the supernatural-romance end) you get a central character who's missing one of the three qualities you're looking for - usually "deadly" or "human". But most of them hit all three.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184056/#Comment_184056" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T22:45:13+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 10:45PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RE Ripley: What Brand said, across the board. I was actually <i>hoping</i> Ripley would qualify, but didn't know if Joe and Johnstone and such were looking for her <i>kind</i> of Sexy/Deadly. I thought they might be wanting a more strictly "Techno-soundtrack spin-kicking in high heels" sort of thing. I think Brand's right that including a Ripley-type character option will significantly decrease the risk of going off the Humanity-rails.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, Alien Ressurection <i>did</i> upgrade Ripley to Ninja Chick in a Catsuit status. . .but it's truly awful. If you've managed to avoid it so far, by God don't spoil your streak now.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Say, how about Storm from the X-Men, when she lost her powers and was leading the Xmen through sheer knife-fighting, mohawk-fu and Chutzpah? She's totally badass, totally razor-sharp hot, and in this case she's struggling because she wants to <i>shed</i> her humanity as a weakness, but it's wreaking all kinds of damage across her relationships.<br/><br/>Also, Magik (Illyana Rasputin) could have been a great Sexy/Deadly candidate if the whole "I may look like a regular Russian teenager but I was RAISED BY SATAN!!" issue had been handled more artfully and humanly. Instead you just get a bunch of regular-teenager-ness punctuated by bouts of "I was raised by Satan!" tantrums.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184057/#Comment_184057" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-17T22:47:38+00:00" title="December 17, 2008 10:47PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ripley was totally in my original list.<br/><br/>Mike, thanks for that detailed response.

(And let's not even bother mentioning her even more sexualized counterpart, Ivy from Soulcalibur) But also, her storyline pretty much precludes her from having any real character development, so that might not work as well.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman could count too. <br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miko_Miyazaki" rel="nofollow">Miko Miyazaki</a> from Order of the Stick but she's not exactly  protagonist material. She's deadly, she's definitely got that charisma coming out of the wazoo.

speaking of the manga versions of the characters here):<br/><br/>Revy - very sexy and very badass, but yes when she opens her mouth she sounds like a sailor and has about as bad an attitude as you can imagine.<br/><br/>Balalaika - The Russian mob boss. If Revy is all unleashed rage, Balalaika is cold, calculating fury. She stays cool and sexy but man, don't <i>ever</i> cross her or get in her way.<br/><br/>Roberta - Roberta's maid schtick is actually a cover for something else, which is actually pretty sexy (although pretty freakin' deranged)<br/><br/>Shenhua - I don't know about you, but I'm all for <i>cheongam</i> dresses! Couple that with two bigass kukri knives and some crazy wuxia moves and I'd call it sexy-badass.<br/><br/>Eda - When she's not wearing her nun's habit she's kinda trailer-park trashy sexy, but she drinks like a fish and can keep up with Revy so she's pretty badass.<br/><br/>Other female characters in Black Lagoon are more cute-badass; Fabiola for example. Sawyer might be considered sexy - if you're into goth chicks, but she's not very badass, just insane...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184068/#Comment_184068" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T01:11:29+00:00" title="December 18, 2008  1:11AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeena Malso of AD Police.

We have 11 archetypes in the game, each one gets a specific special power that can be used once per game. The archetype description is there to help you create your Lady, although ultimately the special power is the only limitation on your character that needs to be justified.<br/><br/>If I do the writing correctly, the reader will read the description of the archetype, form an idea of it, then look at the examples and see both a) a bang-on example that he already knows and confirms his idea, and b) another example that doesn't fit and makes him say "oh, you can do that too?" Above and beyond that, it would also be nice to have people discover good movies/other media by checking out something on the list they haven't heard of, but that's just icing.<br/><br/>Some examples are easy to line up to archetypes. The archetype Perfect is the chick who was created to be a killing machine. Major Kusanagi (cyborg) and (La Femme) Nikita (special training) are excellent examples. So is Selene from Underworld - 'cause she was made into a vampire and that dude her boss trained her to be bad-ass. But you could play a possessed chick (Exorcist, Prince of Darkness) and say Satan made her that way.<br/><br/>A character like Alice from Resident Evil is hard for me to use. She could be Perfect, 'cause she wakes up in a lab, and she kicks some ass. She could be Black Widow, 'cause she has some bad flashbacks and isn't that her boyfriend? She could be the Underdog, 'cause she's pretty tough.<br/><br/>My personal definition of Deadly is pretty lax - if one killing is good enough or the law, it's good enough for me. I don't think Jean Grey ever kills anybody... Dark Phoenix, on the other hand, is absolutely what this game is about. She could fit into several different archetypes - The Gorgon, if you want to emphasize her fearsomeness and telepathic blitzkrieg; Firestarter if you want to play her as a wild card; and you could make a case for Undying, Perfect, Elite, or Black Widow. Actually, I think maybe I'll list Dark Phoenix as an example under the Gorgon archetype, 'cause that one is harder to find good examples for.<br/><br/>Storm? Huh, I dunno. She's not Elite if she loses her powers. Probably Underdog. Does she have some sort of martial ethic at all?

She's dedicated to being the very very best modern-day soldier she can possibly be, but caught in the paradox that in fulfilling her nature she's destroying her life at the whims of her controllers (she lost both her lover and her child to their machinations). . .and she herself is expendable. And the smartness is way played-up, like I alluded before she basically coordinated half of WWII, and throughout the story she's playing an elaborate triple-cross game and manipulating literally everyone. Her unassailable prowess in person is played up too though.<br><br>She only appears in this game; it's a prequel set in the sixties, and the Snake you play here is her pupil who becomes the villain of earlier (chronologically "later") games. Turns out that his mad dream of creating a city-state as a haven for soldiers was inspired by her.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bad Johnstone</cite>Are there lots of flashbacks or references to conflicts and suffering in her past?</blockquote>\nOh my <i>GOD</i> yes. All while trying to lay low and live happily ever after with her best-friend-who-won't-admit-to-herself-she's-a-lesbian. And her original job description was "prostitute AND blackmailer AND assassin for the rich and powerful."<br><br>Y'know what it is? I think she's<i> laying low</i> as an Underdog.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bad Johnstone</cite>For both Tambi and Sydney Bristow</blockquote>\nTambi is an amazonian thug for Katchoo's vampy megalomaniacal boss, but then assassinates the boss and takes over--and turns out to have been a careful planner all along who was using her position. She's, as I said, an amazon, but also a super-competent leader, both on the field and off, of a globe-spanning black ops shadow-government organization. I don't think it's ever explained where she got her training.<br><br/>Sidney was inducted into the CIA in college based on fitting an aptitude/morality profile and became a top feild agent, only they were only pretending to be the CIA, they killed her fiance when she told him about her job, and now she's working as a double agent for the real CIA to take them down. She does a lot of "sexy disguises to get close to the mark and get his trust/data/widget" type work, but honestly Sidney in action is more about the job going wrong and her dodging bullets and kicking people in the solar plexus.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184223/#Comment_184223" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-18T23:26:39+00:00" title="December 18, 2008 11:26PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone, The Boss is DEFINITELY Sphynx material.

Her strategic and tactical mastery is a big part of who she is. She dies in combat at the end only because it is her choice.

You can talk one player into fighting another player by promising to betray their trust and ambush them, but the special power gives you an extra scene where one person gets a trust weakness and a weakness exists to be betrayed.<br/><br/>So I was just watching some Birds of Prey, the tv show. Harley Quinn is one example - psychiatric scenes to build trust, which gets betrayed later on. Angelina Jolie in Wanted is an awesome example - the bullet-bending scene builds trust, which is betrayed when she has to kill him, plus the choice she makes at the end. But ladies who kick ass and also are able to build good relationships can go in this category - I was thinking Buffy could be an Oracle. Or Nancy in Sin City - Marv trusts her, she trusts Hartigan.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>Any examples for this one?</blockquote>\nYeah I don't seem to read much vampire fiction, and Anne Rice is uh, bad when it comes to chicks who kick ass. My original inspiration was the Pig Destroyer album Terrifyer, which has 3-6 different undead chicks featured, but there's undead women in Back From the Dead and Living Dead Girl (La morte vivant). But fake death chicks seem kinda hard to come by. Ada Wong in the Resident Evil games gets killed a few times and returns. Rei in Neon Genesis Evangelion has clones of herself.<br/><br/>I've ended up spending more time doing research for examples than actually writing the game, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184653/#Comment_184653" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T21:32:48+00:00" title="December 22, 2008  9:32PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so let me try to get this straight: Person A has a "trust weakness," so Person B says to person C: "Hey, attack A and I'll ambush her using her Trust weakness."

Obviously, my days of GI Joe fandom are lost in the mists of time and have not been updated except for some small recognition that there was a new comic-book series some few years ago...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>OK, so let me try to get this straight: Person A has a "trust weakness," so Person B says to person C: "Hey, attack A and I'll ambush her using her Trust weakness." And so they do, but then Person B gets a trust weakness that another person can call in on<i>her</i>later, and so on?</blockquote>\nNo, you have flashbacks during the normal phase of the game, where you mostly kill mooks and stuff. In a Flashback, you target another Lady, and one of you gets a Weakness, based on cards you play. During the Endgame, you call in a Weakness and you can take the McGuffin if they Love you, force them to fight if they Hate you, or you can ambush them while they are in a fight with somebody else if they Trust you. You might not want somebody to ambush the Lady you're fighting - what if they win and take the McGuffin?<br/><br/>The Oracle gets one extra Flashback per game, but it has to be a scene of Passion or Solidarity. So, your two Ladies were lovers, teammates, colleagues or friends once. So you could be, like "If you love me, give me the McGuffin," and your opponent tears up and hands it over so you can win the game, or you can be like "I'm sorry Indy, but you should have listened to your father." It's competitive, but you still have to narrate a story. Like the Roach, but with cards instead of dice, and a few more rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184661/#Comment_184661" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-23T00:05:03+00:00" title="December 23, 2008 12:05AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, I gotcha.

Willow dies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, Buffy didn't lie...
