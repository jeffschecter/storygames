We only had an hour and a half for Fiasco but figured we'd give it a try. We're all experienced Fiasco hands, so the compressed time frame worked out fine. We used Dan Puckett's great Manna Hotel playset. The setup:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/fiasco/manna_ap.jpg"/><br/><br/>We sorted this out like this: Steve's guy was the owner of the hotel and a powerful cultist. I was night manager and an ambitious initiate. Robo was my on-again-off-again girlfriend, the daughter of the boss who wanted into the cult but was being kept at arms length by her daddy. Ian played her friend and occasional girlfriend. Ian made the brilliant move of making his character the identical twin sister of the murder victim, which caused everything to fall into place - I'd killed her sister June thinking it was her, to gain cosmic power and remove a romantic rival from Anna's life. I had no idea April had a twin. The Grand Master wanted to know WTF I had done, and I wanted to usurp his ritual authority.April, still very much alive, had seen the aftermath of my sacrifice but blacked out from the trauma and wasn't sure about anything.<br/><br/>All this, of course, set up the fucking <i>great </i>scene where my idiot cultist tried to commingle with the spirit realm using his "new-found power" and April showed up looking for casual sex with Anna and broke my mind. The woman I murdered has returned!  Eventually she figures out why I am so terrified and uses me like a carnival hand puppet to destroy myself and her lover's father.<br/><br/>I was hoping to get all supernatural-freaky, and we strongly hinted at it (the cult leader had a creepy servant named Mr. Creedmore who had a voice like rattling leaves and was only selectively visible), but most of the weirdness was prosaic. Super, super fun, and we blazed through it in an hour and a half.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279653/#Comment_279653" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-08T07:43:28+00:00" title="July  8, 2010  7:43AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the graphic!<br/><br/>So what happened inside the toilet tank?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279654/#Comment_279654" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-08T07:46:22+00:00" title="July  8, 2010  7:46AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah:<br/><br/>And what was the key to getting it to play so fast?

The murder weapon (Object: Weapon: Sacrificial dagger) was hidden in the toilet tank, and retrieved later.<br/><br/>In that diagram, all the grey stuff was authored in play - NPCs and locations.<br/><br/>We played fast because we knew we only had an hour and a half and we all really knew the game well. So every scene was punchy and moved the story forward, we edited ruthlessly, and generally kept on task. There was no debating about how to resolve if somebody established; we've played enough to just check in silently and roll with the outcome. The setup was fast - I used my convention setup, which is "do Relationships first, then do everything else."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279667/#Comment_279667" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-08T08:35:44+00:00" title="July  8, 2010  8:35AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
