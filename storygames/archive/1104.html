                    I'm bored, and insomniacal.  So here's a game, inspired by the preview for Shooting the Moon, Tony's Zen Dice, and my ongoing project.<br/><br/>You need paper, pencils, a bunch of six-sided dice, and one 'token' for each player (something they can hide in a closed hand).<br/><br/>This is a game for three or more players.  Each player will have a character, a shadowy secret agent working deep in the web of intrigue, lies, and double-crosses; some are rebels, some are plants, some are contacts, snitches, you name it.  A character is defined by five virtues: Cunning, Daring, Grace, Patience, and Zeal.<br/><br/>To make a character, give them a name and and a job in the underworld, and assign the numbers 3, 3, 2, 2, and 1 to the five virtues, in any order you like.  Write these down.  Also, write down the names of the other characters, as a list.  You're done.<br/><br/>The players roll to see who goes first, and then take turns going around the table.  The object of the game is to gain control over other characters, in order to avoid being controlled.  The characters know this, too.<br/><br/>------------<br/><br/>On your turn, you may either attempt to blackmail another character, or trade leverage with them.<br/><br/>If you decide to trade information with someone, describe how you approach them and improvise a quick scene, including an exchange of leverage.  Leverage is something that will give their character some means of gaining control over you, if it's true.  At the end of the scene, each player holds out one closed fist.  Either it contains their token, or it doesn't.  They reveal if it does or not at the same time.  If you had your token in your hand, the other player gains one point of leverage on you (that list of names is for tracking this).  If your opponent had theirs in hand, you gain a point of leverage on them (note it down).  If either of you didn't have your token in-hand, that person (or both of you, if you both showed an empty hand) puts a checkmark next to their Cunning.<br/><br/>If you decide to try and blackmail over another character, say so, and who.  Pick up as many six-sided dice as you have points of leverage on them, and roll them all.  Each die that scores a number *higher* than their Grace is one success.  If you get *more* successes than their Zeal, all on one roll, you've blackmailed them.  If not, you're failed.<br/><br/>--------------------<br/><br/>And now, the fiddly bits.<br/><br/>Whenever you fail at an attempt to take control of another player, you lose as many points of leverage over them as their Patience.<br/><br/>Once you have as many Checkmarks next to your Cunning as (number of other players multiplied by your Cunning), you must *always* have your token in-hand when you trade information with someone.  This is a finite resource.<br/><br/>Anytime another player would blackmail you, you may force them to immediately re-roll as many of their successes as your rating in Daring.<br/><br/>---------------<br/><br/>Winning and losing.<br/><br/>Once you have blackmailed, or been blackmailed, by another player, the two of you are done with each other - you can't trade information with or try to blackmail each other anymore.<br/><br/>When every single relationship is done (everyone has balckmailed or been blackmailed by someone else), the game ends.<br/><br/>Whoever has been blackmailed the least wins.  If there's a tie, they share the victory.<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>And, uh, that's it, I think.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>

                            I put my comments on the LJ entry where you first posted this, but here they are again:  doesn't this turn into an endurance contest on Cunning?  Is there ever a reason to put your token in-hand until you have to?  Does the answer to that last question change if we introduce prisoners'-dilemma stuff into the gamble (ie both empty costs you two checkmarks each, both full means you both regen a checkmark)?                        </div>

That's the second time that's been said to me...<br/><br/>*Some googling later*<br/><br/>...Yeah.  It totally does.  Now, I need to figure how to do that.                        </div>

                            It's basically going to require reworking the leverage resolution. <br/><br/>Empty hand is a cheating in this case, and holding your token is cooperating.<br/><br/>You need to mechanically have the results be:<br/>1. both cheating is BAD - say you both place tick against cunning<br/>2. If A cheats B and B cooperates, A gets a big win. A gains leverage<br/>3. If both cooperate, then both gain a decent advantage. This is what you're missing now - maybe something they can both use against the other characters when betraying? This advantage must be worse than what you get for cheating (i.e. case 2 win).                        </div>
