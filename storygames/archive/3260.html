I mean, you can make a situation that's a town full of happy people without a care in the world, but if there's nothing for the characters to do, that's just a crappy situation.  A 'better' situation is a town full of unhappy, desperate people who want or need the characters to do things, preferably to other people in the town.  Or in non-Dogs examples, a pile of gold in a perfectly safe cave just outside of the city walls is a boring situation; put a dragon on top of the pile of gold and orcs guarding the tunnels down to it, and maybe some traps and gelatinous cubes, and now you have an engaging situation.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L. Rhoer</cite>So it's a fancy way of saying it sets the parameters or scope of the game?</blockquote>\nThe key is that situation is composed of the elements of the fiction and how they're related.  "Scope of the game" could also include what system you're playing, when you're getting together, who's GMing, and so on.
