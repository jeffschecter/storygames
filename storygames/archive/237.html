                    Today the company you are working for is laying off 1/3rd of its employees. You can't afford to loose this job. What are you willing to do to keep it? <br/>
<br/>
Will you sell out your fellow co workers? <br/>
Will you get a promotion? <br/>
What if you are let go? <br/>
Will you sue to keep your job? <br/>
Will you get a huge severance? <br/>
Will you finally do that naughty thing you always wanted to do now that it doesn't matter? <br/>
<br/>
Beyond the above I have no or very few preconceptions. I don't care if this uses any random elements; dice, cards or whatever. I don't know how many people playing at the same time this will support. I don't know if there will be a character sheet or a GM. I don't know if players will play 1 or multiple characters. Maybe everyone plays the same character. Maybe you each play different parts of the same person's personality with different agendas. What kind of company? Great question. I'm not sure. Maybe as part of character creation, players will have guidelines to create the company together. Maybe the company is a player. I have no idea. But whatever it is, it will rock!<br/>
<br/>
Images, emotions, sayings, situations that also come to mind (besides all the many faces of people I have layed off and fired over the years, yes, this may indeed be therapy for me): <br/>
<br/>
Resume, Water Cooler, Pay Check, Savings, Rent, Student Loans<br/>
<br/>
Escorted out of the building <br/>
<br/>
Seniority vs. qualifications and competency <br/>
<br/>
Opportunity, Promotion, taking over someone's job who was layed off above you <br/>
<br/>
Laying off someone who is on or about to take pregnancy leave, disability leave, family leave, medical leave, or vacation <br/>
<br/>
Pay cuts, offers to rehire you or job offers from outside companies to do the same job with much less money <br/>
<br/>
Discriminations, Harassment, Sexism, Racism, Ageism, Religion-ism(sp?), Individuals with disabilities <br/>
<br/>
Stock options, 401k plummet... your retirement is gone <br/>
<br/>
Fear, Paranoia, Self worth, Loyalty, Morale <br/>
<br/>
Stress, Trauma, Shock, Therapy <br/>
<br/>
Notifications <br/>
<br/>
Email fellow employees goodbye and where they can contact you <br/>
<br/>
Copy everything off your computer <br/>
<br/>
Delete all the porn, freelance and non-work files from your computer <br/>
<br/>
Dependants, Spouse, Children, Child support <br/>
<br/>
Pity, how others react to you <br/>
<br/>
Handing off your projects, clean, sabotage <br/>
<br/>
Severance <br/>
<br/>
Unused sick and vacation days <br/>
<br/>
Cobra, paying half of your medical bills for the next 18 months <br/>
<br/>
Unemployment <br/>
<br/>
No, were laying everyone else, but you, you're fired <br/>
<br/>
Networking <br/>
<br/>
Portfolio <br/>
<br/>
Exit interview <br/>
<br/>
"It's just business, nothing personal" <br/>
<br/>
Litigation <br/>
<br/>
Blame, bullshit excuses, cold hard reality, "you are no longer viable" <br/>
<br/>
Employee rivalries... who will make the cut this time <br/>
<br/>
Review <br/>
<br/>
Snitching, spying on fellow employees <br/>
<br/>
No union (we'll stick to white color jobs with no union support) <br/>
<br/>
Early retirement incentives <br/>
<br/>
Laying off someone who just worked 100 hours a week for 2 months on a major deadline <br/>
<br/>
Layoffs when the companies stock and profits are rising <br/>
<br/>
Employee flipping out and verbally or physically assaulting an employer or other employee <br/>
<br/>
"Tighten our belts, slash costs" <br/>
<br/>
Your position is being outsourced overseas <br/>
<br/>
Company tried to go public, pulled IPO <br/>
<br/>
"We're just refocusing the company to best capitalize on the new opportunities in the emerging and ever changing marketplace, restructuring in the aftermath of our mergers, disappointing quarter earnings, and economical downturn in our business sector"<br/>
<br/>
Pretending to do work, even when everyone knows you have nothing to do<br/>
<br/>
Being laid off even though you are an awesome employee<br/>
<br/>
Playing flashbacks during your review to see if you make the cut or not and as your reviewer brings up incidents you relive and play them out. Which can lead to burying yourself even further or finding some sort of out.                </div>

<p>You know, from our point of view Huge Frickin' Monsters and Eldrich Horror are rather detached from our lives, but ultimately just a fantasy. They're safe.</p>

<br/>
Disability<br/>

Mourning<br/>
