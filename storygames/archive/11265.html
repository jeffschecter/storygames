Long time no see!<br/><br/>So!<br/><br/>In my psychic's campaign (using the the NWoD system) I decided making a hack to the morality and diciplines system (from Vampire: The Requiem) to make a psychic abilities system.<br/><br/>Here's how it works (I'll assume you know how the original systems work here, as to make it brief):<br/><br/>Your morality is now called "Sanity", You start with a sanity of 10.<br/><br/>Instead of blood-points you now have, psy-points; You get 10 psy-points every session of play, no storing psy-points for later sessions.<br/><br/>You can use your psy-points for a number of things: As experience-points to buy any ability, to trigger disciplines, to get bonuses to dice rolls, to heal damage (mind over matter), and most every other use blood-points have.<br/><br/>Any discipline can be obtained by anybody, at any moment in play (so long as you have enough experience and/or psy-points to buy it), disciplines cost one xp/psy point per level. At sanity 0, your character is no longer playable, make a new one. You can use disciplines of a level inversely equivalent to your sanity divided by two.<br/><br/>sanity - Discipline level<br/>10  -  1<br/>8  -  2<br/>6  -  3<br/>4  -  4<br/>2  -  5<br/><br/>Every discipline has a cost of at least one psy-point to be used. you can, at any point, give up a level of sanity in exchange for 10 more psy-points. You can, at any point, give up all of your psy-points, Once you run out of psy points, you get a bonus of 2 to all discipline rolls. if the discipline doesn't require a roll, you simply get an enhanced effect to it.<br/><br/>You get a derangement each and every time you drop a level of sanity. You do not loose morality by crossing a line of sinful behavior, but by participating of psychic abilities.<br/><br/>At the end of every game session, you roll a pool equal to your lasting psy-points, you need to a success of 10 in the roll, otherwise, you loose a point of sanity.<br/><br/><br/>There it is, now a little explanation:<br/><br/>Psychic abilitites, in my game, are powerful and easyly obtainable and upgradable, they give the bearer quite an amount of power. But the cost you must pay is your own sanity. the crazier you are, the more powerful you get. Your mind has the power to bend reality, the more it can bend it, the less it can grasp it. You can bend reality so much that your mind looses it's sense of it.<br/><br/>What do you think about it? I think I need some more bad things happening to the characters when loosing sanity, not for the sake of balance, mind you, but because I want them to feel that this power does have a high cost.</span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250204/#Comment_250204" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-10T05:17:31+00:00" title="January 10, 2010  5:17AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this! It's like World of Darkness crossed with Call of Cthulhu. Can you get Sanity points back? I'm hoping not.<br/><br/>One thing I liked, about oWoD;s Humanity, was that committing certain acts would make you lose Humanity. What I'd really like would be that seeing certain things makes you lose Sanity. This is how Call of Cthulhu works: you see something nasty, you make a Sanity roll. So, personally, rather than having that pool-rolling at the end of a session, I'd have it when you see or do things that would shake your Sanity.<br/><br/>Collections of derangements are often less interesting than you feel they should be. So, you've got Megalomania and Paranoia and you get Kleptomania, too: it gets hard to roleplay. Could there be some way to advance derangements, instead? When your Sanity goes down, your Megalomania gets worse.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_250211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250211/#Comment_250211" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-10T09:29:20+00:00" title="January 10, 2010  9:29AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, I\u2019m new here but have played The Requiem , some rules I can remember!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour idea looks great and highlights the possible use of Humanity and Sanity in the same game.<br/>\nIf I understand this right you\u2019re doing away with humanity and replacing it with sanity.<br/>\nHow about keeping both?<br/>\nBut moving derangements over to sanity,<br/>\nIf I remember correctly, derangements are just side effects of losing humanity?<br/>\nBut the loss of humanity is through the loss of Sanity.<br/>\nThe loss of humanity releases the beast.

My solution was to make them roll just once per session of play; that way, they would last at least 10 sessions.<br><br>Now, on a second thought (and since I re-checked the math and realized it is actually quite easy to succeed the roll with at least 3 dice) I think I might have a new approach to it:<br><br>Make them roll every time they interact with some psychic ability, or be themselves the perpetrators, but only allow for the loss of 1 point of sanity per session in this manner... maybe make them roll after every scene, so the fiction can go on mostly uninterrupted.<br><br>One thing I did loose track of was derangements, I think I'll take your suggestion and limit the number of different derangements they can get.I think it is really important to make the derangements act as often as possible so they actually im\xb4pact the life of the character.<br><br>And, no, at the moment, you can not regain sanity, I do think I need to come up with a way for them to regain it, though, just in case they are getting way to near to the 0 and they realize they need to stop or else they'll completely loose it...<br><br>Any suggestions for such a mechanic? one thing I know, It Has To Be Insanely Difficult To Regain Sanity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250227/#Comment_250227" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-10T13:03:15+00:00" title="January 10, 2010  1:03PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, make it quite easy - they just have to permanently lose the psychic ability they obtained when they lost sanity.
