Apart from being a Danish role player, my cred here is having been a judge at Fastaval in 2003 and 2006. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve played quite a few and read a lot of the Danish scenarios from the last 15 years. My knowledge is not exhaustive and I want to start by saying that there\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be lots of generalizations and simplifications. The amount and variety of Danish scenarios is actually quite astounding.<br/>\n<br/>\nA historical overview: the Danish scenario tradition is married to the congress tradition. By that I mean that they wouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t be what they are if they hadn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t been created for play at conventions or been created in that environment. The roots go back quite a while, but one of the most interesting and notable developments came in the early 1990s, when Fastaval introduced the Ottos (inspired by the Oscars) \xe2\u20ac\u201c awards for the scenario author rather than for the \xe2\u20ac\u0153best group\xe2\u20ac\x9d as had been the tradition until then. Suddenly, there was a very evident focus on the writer\xe2\u20ac\u2122s job \xe2\u20ac\u201c on plot, character, presentation etc. As Mikkel says in the Celebrity Deathmatch podcast, this gave writers a new impetus to write scenarios and introduced a sense of friendly competition among peers. As a result, the tradition saw a whole lot of developments over the next many years, launching new trends such as the intrigue scenario, the story telling scenario etc. The scenarios at Fastaval are evaluated by a jury of peers that have been chosen because of their knowledge, taste, reputation etc. More often than not the judges are also scenario writers themselves. <br/>\n<br/>\nToday, the best examples of this tradition are very refined, the writers very aware of and educated on the various techniques. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf one were to single out some characteristics of the tradition, one could mention:<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthor- and GM-centered: these scenarios often have a very strong author-voice (not to be mistaken for the author stance. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m talking about the actual writer of the scenario as such) \xe2\u20ac\u201c plenty scenarios are very personal and have a clear message. There is a direct line from author to the GM to the players. There is a feeling that the author \xe2\u20ac\u201c and his extension, the GM \xe2\u20ac\u201c is in more or less total control of the game. Events are lined up, interconnected and coherent in order to tell \xe2\u20ac\u0153a story\xe2\u20ac\x9d that is actually \xe2\u20ac\u0153THE story\xe2\u20ac\x9d \xe2\u20ac\u201c the author\xe2\u20ac\u2122s. There are many similarities to film and novels and many scenario writers appear to see themselves as exactly that \xe2\u20ac\u201c a kind of movie director or fiction writer. The GM has lots of power over the game, cutting and framing scenes to ensure the perfect pacing and making sure that the author\xe2\u20ac\u2122s vision is realized as much as possible. There is a bank of techniques being refined upon and added to \xe2\u20ac\u201c quite informal, but still some clear trends have developed throughout time. Many scenario texts include advice on running the game using these techniques. This may actually be the subject of another discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this art? The art discussion used to be very prevalent on the Danish scene \xe2\u20ac\u201c not so much anymore, but a lot of these scenarios are clearly written to be pieces of art. This means that there is a clear aesthetic level to the text and to the ensuing play and also ties nicely into the Author-centered point above.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiceless - often known as systemless: dice and related mechanics fell out of fashion sometime around 1995 or so. The feeling is that the dice and numbers will break immersion. The emphasis is on "role" not "play" or "game". There's plenty of system, of course, but most of it is either unspoken or mostly managed by the GM (to be fair, we are seeing quite a number of developments in this area these past few years). Resolution is mostly up to the GM and/or consensus and is tied into "THE story" insofar as each conflict is supposed so support the grand story and push the narrative in that direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmersion and player role: a bit simplified, the role of the player is to be immersed in his/her character and use this to influence the game. The players are in for a ride that the author and/or GM will lead them through, so the player\xe2\u20ac\u2122s job is to experience this through the eyes of his/her character. This holds true, even if a player is supposed to play several PC\xe2\u20ac\u2122s over the course of the scenario or the like. There is a tradition of long, pregenerated character descriptions with pieces of "fiction" - often "poetic" descriptions as seen through the character's eyes. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, so there you have a quick, incomplete overview of the Danish tradition. We can go several ways from here \xe2\u20ac\u201c discussing each point (not everyone will agree with my generalizations), examining different scenarios, looking at similarities and differences compared to the indie/story game tradition or discussing some of the techniques. We can also discuss other developments and trends that go in other directions than the ones I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve briefly touched upon. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne fun thing we might do is to take a story game and see how that would turn out as a Danish scenario \xe2\u20ac\u201c e.g. Grey Ranks (because I see a whole lot of similarity there).<br/>\n<br/>\nCorrections, discussion, comments and questions are all very welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n/Peter<br/>\n<br/>\nEdited because I forgot all about diceless and long character descriptions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Then they will meet, online and irl, and discuss the qualities and failings of each, judging from the text and trying to imagine how it will play out at the table. Some scenarios will also be tested, if the jury feels it's necessary.

First of all: no, what I'll say here will not cover every part of the Danish tradition and will (again) most likely be simplifications and generalizations. But, you know...<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, similarities: Grey Ranks (GR) has the exact same kind of narrow focus that you'd find in a Danish con scenario. There's a set time period (some 63 days, right?), an interesting situation (the Uprising) and a group of people, whose lives are forever changed. There's plenty of drama for a great story right there. You'll find many of the same kind of parallels between the two traditions in e.g. Dogs, MLWM or Polaris.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what's different then? Obviously, the heavy use of explicit mechanics is a huge difference. You might be able to say that it's mostly techniques that mark the major difference, come to think of it? And the distribution of techniques - who gets to use the techniques, for instance? The Danish tradition relies on implicit techniques as well as a GM that is in more or less total control over the plot (that's an overstatement). <br/>\n<br/>\nGR as a Danish scenario would most likely have a set cast of PCs with detailed backgrounds that the players didn't get to change or influence that much. The unfolding of events would then probably be tied closely to the PCs in such a way that it would also be their story (exactly as is the case with GR). The players would mostly colour the game by their portrayal of the characters - and, obviously, by making choices on their behalf. From the players' standpoint, the game would become interesting because of immersion and the joy of being part of a great story (but probably with less influence over the story than in GR as it is).<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that make sense (I'm writing this with my 8 months old daughter on the arm, so it's a tad hard to concentrate :)?<br/>\n<br/>\n/Peter                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sven" title="sven"><img alt="sven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sven">sven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103561/#Comment_103561" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T00:40:35+00:00" title="October 18, 2007 12:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really appreciate this thread, since I am quite curious. I will probable have a lot of questions, but I will start with just a couple right now and hope that someone can answer them!<br/><br/>In Sweden we sometimes talk about the Swedish/Danish freeform scene, which I usually write friform so people don't think I speak about British larps or anything. The Danish scene is of course more prominent than the Swedish, there are really few friform games at Swedish cons these days. It seems to me that the type of games that you describe are quite the same as the typical Swedish friform game.<br/><br/>Firstly I wonder about the style of play. Is it always only verbal or is it common 'play scenes out' on the floor and so on? Are there any games that uses 'live' play' throughout the whole game, is it common to have a mixture or do the players generally sit firmly at the table the whole game?<br/><br/>Secondly, how common is it with freer games, freer with respect to the story and what you can tell about your characters? The type of game you describe above I can very much recognize as the typical Swedish friform scenario. But several of the successful writing groups (in Sweden the scenarios are usually presented as created by a group rather than an individual author, although the actual author usually is acknowledged too) have also written scenarios with much more room for the player. The Jeep is an obvious example that avid readers of this forum would know about, but also ASF as well as Frispel have a few games without pre-determined story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103581/#Comment_103581" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T05:36:42+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  5:36AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2007 5:37AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was talking about this last night and decided I need to write a <i>Grey Ranks</i> scenario in this tradition.

It'll be a good exercise while I wait for Peter and his friends to translate some stuff for us.<br/><br/>Sven, Brian Rasmussen told me about differences in play style for the same scenario - he'd played <i>A Day in the Life</i> before, and in the previous instance it was much more physical - they designated a "stage" and people stepped into that space to play out scenes, then left it when the scene was edited or ended naturally.  We stayed seated most of the time in our session.

Some scenarios advocate one style or the other, but most are not explicit about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe actual term used is "semi-live", when some scenes are acted out on the floor. <br/>\n<br/>\nA common technique is also to have players change play area when e.g. different layers in the story is acted out. This can be as simple as having two tables set up, or more advanced with one part of the room being designated as the "scene" and the other part being the table play area. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome examples:<br/>\n<br/>\nMurder of a King, a shakespearean tragedy:<br/>\n<br/>\nI GMed this by putting a line of tape across the floor, clearing one area as the stage area with a generic stage setup (a table, a few chairs, open space), and arranging chairs in rows in the other area, facing the stage as audience area.<br/>\n<br/>\nScenes would be acted outs with symbolic props, and monologues and asides would be spoken out towards the audience. The players not playing a role in the scene would act as audience, and I encouraged them to cheer and shout at the actors on stage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know other groups playing this scenario purely seated around the table. However, during my preparation, I judged this scenario to be best played semi-live. The scenario does not dictate the play style.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Making of Titanic II, a 50ies cult movie documentary:<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two layers of the story: One layer is interviews with each of the actors. Another layer is scenes from the actual movie. The interview layer is played out with chairs in a circle in one end of the room, each player/actor in a chair and the interviewer in the center. The movie layer is the other end of the room, again arranged in a generic setup with a table, a few chairs and enough open space to walk around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis scenario actually advices this particular setup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

In some scenarios, the GM does not have much to do except start the game up and occasional throw in some moderation. Once the game is going, the GM can be mostly a spectator to the players' show. Other games need heavy moderation and relies very much on the GM to set scenes, play opposition, and gently following the players expressed interest while pushing the story towards the central themes and conflicts. This can be heavy duty, especially if the group is inhomogenous and are looking for different types of games.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome scenarios have explored GM-less variants, but this has been difficult to pull off. First of all, there is a very practical task of reading and understanding the game and then presenting it to the players showing up, possibly complete strangers with very different backgrounds, and then convincing everyone that this will be a great session. Secondly, the distribution of authority during play can easily be unclear when communicated purely by written material (and unconventional). Thirdly, a large number of players do not like to invent things on the fly, a common issue with many story games as well. One extreme variant of GM-less scenarios is very close to shared reading of fiction with a group of friends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103980/#Comment_103980" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-20T19:23:05+00:00" title="October 20, 2007  7:23PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2007 5:43PM by scottdunphy.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fjj</cite>Can you provide a link to the game material of one of your Colorado style games?</blockquote>\nNo problem! <a href="http://rp-artisans.org/tiki/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=94" rel="nofollow">This file</a> has background and character sheets for one of our events. Don't be fooled by the d20 stats, this is a game all about playing characters in a story:<br/><br/>This is a more extreme example of the for and not all of our games have this much background. In addition to this information, each of the characters had a secret and a contact that the other characters don't know (we provided that on a yet another sheet). Revelation of their secrets and speaking to their contacts drove the story forward. <br/><br/>Sorry, I don't have the scenario for that one available online. But I think reading the characters give you an idea of how our game differ from just saying "here are some 'pregenerated' characters". The scenarios involve the character backgrounds and secrets, so that's not flavor text by any stretch.<br/><br/>pedyo's description sounds very similar to Colorado style games. Our tradition started with local authors that wrote character-provided events for the RPGA (called "classics") and when that organization stopped running those kind of events, we just kept running them on our own. Not all RPGA classics were as involved as the scenarios in our tradition, but many of them were. <br/><br/>I think a lot of what we have done since 2003 has paralleled indie RPG development - both are all about story and roleplaying, but we're layering that on top of traditional RPGs (and not only d20) and indie games write their own rules. To have a good story-focused game playing a character-provided event in a traditional RPG system requires the players to focus on the backgrounds and character interactions first and worry about the crunchy bits second. This is often a challenge. I think the indie games succeed to greater degree because the rule are focused toward the desired result.<br/><br/>I'm pretty much done with traditional RPGs. And that might mean that I'm done with this style of scenario writing. I still see a lot of value in providing characters that are already integrated into the scenario, but most of the indie games I have played, read, and heard of benefit greatly from the players creating the characters and the story. So I'm still looking and thinking of how to do both, but I'm mostly planning to just run indie games for the time being.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
