(Probably a better one to start with.)<br/>\n<br/>\n*About the Forge there: "Stake-setting" for instance. It's a wonderful idea, and once you've got used to it, stake-setting is a good term. But it's only so much gobbeldy-gook for someone to hear it without a sufficient background education. Is there a bullet point we could use?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance:<br/>\nA lot of these games look at task resolution differently. The dice are rolled not to determine if you succeed or fail, but what you get out of what you did.<br/>\n(No, that doesn't quite work, but I'm sure one of you smarter guys can condense it properly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr: There's a difference between saying what happens and saying how it happens. This kind of game takes that very seriously. You can sometimes win the general outcome you want (your character saves the princess but the team gets captured) and then someone else comes along and adds inconvenient but fun details (the princess was working for the other side, the team learns the information you need to finish the quest from eavesdropping on their captor, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr: Many of these games are about compensations, succeeding when you have to but discovering the price you're willing to pay.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr: You need to look at task resolution differently for each of these games.They have a new kind of behavior they want to encourage and once you've found how the rules reflect that behavior, you can understand how the game works. Fortunately, the designer usually states what that behavior is pretty directly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, you can see why someone like me would need a sheet like this. It's very difficult to sell a confused GM on a game when you can't even get across first principles.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376956/#Comment_376956" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T11:48:54+00:00" title="May  7, 2012 11:48AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like a lot of the principles in AW for Story Games in general, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Play to find out what happens.</li>\n<li>Look through crosshairs.</li>\n<li>Address yourself to the characters, not the players.</li>\n<li>Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.</li>\n<li>Be a fan of the players' characters.</li></ul>\nI think these in particular are well-suited to the Story Games ethos.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376957/#Comment_376957" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T11:51:12+00:00" title="May  7, 2012 11:51AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2012 11:51AM by Arpie.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would you mind expanding on the "look through the crosshairs" one - I have no idea what that means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376958/#Comment_376958" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T11:53:07+00:00" title="May  7, 2012 11:53AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play to find out what happens works, but it says that right there in, say Ghost/Echo.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome GMs, it turns out, interpret that as "play to find out What I Made Up" - which is the traditional way of doing things.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlay to Find Out What Everyone in the Group Wants to Happen - maybe that's clearer but not overly long?

Mediocre GMing is the same each time. The games from the tradition I pride myself as good with (for example MLwM, Dust Devils, TMW, Primetime Adventures, TSoY, etc.) are different despite having been published very close together and taking influence from each other, and I would give different advice for each. Some basic principles could be derived (I consider the fact that a skilled GM with these games can adapt quickly to a new game), but they would be exactly that incomprehensible theoretical gobbledygook due to the necessity of wide application. Like, I'd say that "System Matters" is great GM advice and a cornerstone of my own style, but what's that gonna do for some newbie?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_376981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376981/#Comment_376981" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T13:30:47+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  1:30PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I admit that I'm skeptical about one set of "instant GM" guidelines working for more than a few closely related games.<br/><br/>I could say some pretty interesting things about how Bliss Stage and Mouse Guard (and maybe Dogs and Agon and Blowback) are "mission-based" games and what that means for GMing, but I would say something totally different about sandbox games like Apocalypse World and Burning Wheel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376989/#Comment_376989" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T13:55:19+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  1:55PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2012 1:55PM by Teataine.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Arpie</cite>Play to find out what happens works, but it says that right there in, say Ghost/Echo.<br/><br/>Some GMs, it turns out, interpret that as "play to find out What I Made Up" - which is the traditional way of doing things.<br/><br/>Play to Find Out What Everyone in the Group Wants to Happen - maybe that's clearer but not overly long?</blockquote>\nFor me, a huge and absolutely integral part of "play to find out what happens" is "things will happen that you don't want to happen".

It's history is "merely" self-publishing, with a lot of hard thought about what causes "4 hours of play for 20 minutes of fun." And that's just about it.<br/><br/>Not much can be said about those aspects of TTOO\xae beyond, for example, "read the rules and actually do what they say; don't try to wrench them into parallel with an existing game that you've played before."<br/><br/>For example: Someone just skimming <i>Burning Wheel</i> might TRY to play it like D&amp;D... and wonder why their advancement is so slow and the whiff factor so high. But if they play by the RAW, they'll be pinging BITs and rolling in Artha and will see that the system works pretty well, for what it does (closely couple significance of actions FOR THE CHARACTER to advancement). Conversely, someone all into stakes setting will spit and struggle with <i>In A Wicked Age</i>, because they aren't declaring discrete actions and using The Stick to drive the fiction when they have the advantage--they're all, like, "what's at stake and what can I roll in" thinking that Vincent only ever made games like <i>Dogs In The Vineyard</i>. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> It cuts both ways....<br/><br/>But, hey, if you can find some good nuggets for speaking of specific <i>aspects</i> of TTOO\xae, then we could drop the nuggets that actually apply directly to the game in the offing (rather than 'Standard Operating Nuggets For Indie Games'). Five or six bullets <i>on each game, specific to that game</i> would do wonders for 'level-setting' folks prior to a first session or demo/convention game.<br/><br/>[TLDR: I like the notion, but not generalized for all "indie" games (as that's a non-category with regards to play techniques in TTOO\xae).]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376994/#Comment_376994" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-07T14:01:58+00:00" title="May  7, 2012  2:01PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2012 11:50AM by Arpie.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I think this is a bad idea because the role of a GM in Dogs in the Vineyard is ridiculously different from the role of a GM in In A Wicked Age and that's ridiculously different from the role of a GM in Apocalypse World, and those are three games<i>by the same person.</i></blockquote>\nWell, and here's the thing: Those three games aren't THAT different.

Indie games <i>culture</i> often tries to encourage a more functional social environment surrounding play, where the players can say: "Hey GM, what's up when you did XYZ? Can we talk about it?" But that's not always (or typically) written into the rules of the game. Plus, power distribution is all over the place, from super-trad setups to more lassez-faire approaches to things that are neither (uh, Agon's competitive-cooperative one-upmanship?). Sometimes when a GM does a poor job, it's not because they don't get indie games (which are, after all, not that different from other games), but because they do a poor job of managaging player involvement (either this one time or all the time), which -- as JD points out -- is an issues in ALL games, not just indie stuff.<br/><br/>Is what you want more of a handbook on creating a healthy social environment for play? That sounds like a tougher but more possible thing.

If the PCs do nothing, the GM has already planned out what will occur.  This is the central step of town creation. The GM must absolutely pre-plan exactly one outcome.  Saying the GM doesn't pre-plan what will happen in Dogs is wrong. They <i>do</i> pre-plan what will happen if the Dogs do nothing. Further, that planning helps the GM work out what happens if the Dogs do <i>something</i> - it establishes how the town works, what lines of communication, action and obligation exist before the Dogs come in and start punching people.  <br/><br/>In fact, not doing the town creation process and just eyeballing a town that sounds interesting or has a cool set of sins in it and seeing what the Dogs do when they show up is one of the key ways I've failed at Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>(Have these guys not ever played D&amp;D in a different way either? D&amp;D's had a lot of changes since 1982, in many different directions.)<br/><br/>Anyway, you could tell them you don't like what they're doing and what you want to try?<br/><br/>Seems like it could work, or at least give you a key piece of information about what they're actually willing to do for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377095/#Comment_377095" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T02:51:11+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  2:51AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll admit, Dogs in the Vineyard has been a thorn in my side since I got involved with "these kinda games."

However, once play begins, the towns are highly interactive and change based on what the players decide to do. Even the Dogs' mere arrival sets things in motion that otherwise might not have happened.

And a lot of designers are adding their own advice on how to run their games (though a bit more of advice and more clear guidelines could help here and there). The Same Page tool linked by Dave looks like a really good starting point for a lot of games and perhaps that's the key here, Arpie: <br/><br/>The advice sheet should be made by the players themselves along with the GM with the rulebook at hand. They all pour in whatever they find fun, the GM adds whatever thinks may be fun from the book to use in pure form (only if the players don't want to use the rules as written, in worst case they should adapt to at least one new mechanic they haven't used before, otherwise what they want is just a different setting and there's no need to play a new game) and then the GM gets to use that to define the way they are going to play.<br/><br/>You can get all kind of good advice but in the end people play what they want in their own way.

There is no monolithic style that pervades all post-Forge RPGs, and no single list of best practices is going to make them all work, nor will would such a list guarantee your enjoyment at the game table. On top of that, there's plenty of "story gaming" one can do with "trad" RPGs, too. Just look at Ron Edwards' or John Wick's accounts of their days playing <i>Champions</i>.<br/><br/>I want to second RobMcDiarmid's advice above. Run some games. Pick ones with strong procedural guidance that evoke the kind of play you want to experience. Run them as-written. The fact that you're finding people running games like <i>Mouse Guard</i> or PTA is a good sign. Offer to GM for these people and show them how it's done!<br/><br/>And let me say that I understand your frustration. I have totally been through the "nobody understands this great new way to play" phase of post-Forge RPG fandom. It can be painful! But you can't force other people to want what you want ("You can't sneak up on mode" as Mike Holmes has said). All you can do is offer to run some games for your friends and hope they enjoy playing them. If they don't, you need to start looking for other people to game with; there is no other solution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377170/#Comment_377170" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T12:38:07+00:00" title="May  8, 2012 12:38PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't you think this kind of connects with the "We shouldn't be calling them RPGs anymore" discussion?

The wiki says it's from 1984, though. Anyway, I'm not saying RPGs aren't diverse, I'm saying that it's easier for players to stick to ways of playing they know better instead of adapting to new games. And that using a single term to define different ways of playing makes it easier to think both old and new games should be handled in similar ways. So Eero is right.<br/><br/>Have my experience here not as a definitive argument, but add it to your own and see if there's a sort of commonground: My group started playing WoD with a GM with experience as an actor and a consistent disregard for some rules, favoring the story. Then we started playing D&amp;D with another GM and played the same way. We took the GM by surprise until he decided to turn tables on us and made rules rain on us restraining our characters and cutting most of the freedom we originally felt. We had to adapt and it was a different kind of fun for a while, though eventually that led me out of the game.<br/><br/>Now, had it been the other way around, perhaps I wouldn't have played WoD at all or would probably try and engage more the rules than the roleplaying part. Who knows. And not that I play a vampire whenever I play, but I have more fun when I roleplay a character than when I try to engage a set of complex rules to optimize it's numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377193/#Comment_377193" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T14:10:23+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  2:10PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paolo, I think the primary problem is that, for decades, there has existed "prevailing wisdom" that game texts are irrelevant, system doesn't matter, and all you need is a good GM. I think this has less to do with terminology and more to do with the evolution of game design and procedures of play.<br/><br/>We've had about a decade or so of discussion now that has challenged all of that prevailing wisdom. Game design has evolved, as have the attitudes we have towards games both old and new (hello OSR).

And I can't admit anyone is close-minded because of all the close-minded things I myself have done (and am probably still doing.) If I hear someone complaining about games and I know there's a solution to their specific complaints in a given system and I recommend that system but they play it in exactly the same way as they've always played (you know, the way they're complaining about) then I prefer to think of it as pathological.<br/>\n<br/>\nI admit, it might be pathological that I seek out post-Forge story gamers in my neck of the woods when I am not dealing with a large and diverse population, but I had similar problems living in Denver.

Pasta is a word that defines a huge variety of dishes. Just because a person always orders spaghetti and meatballs and complains that other pastas don't taste like spaghetti and meatballs doesn't mean that the word "pasta" is a badly formed category.<br/><br/>I disagree that we disagree in that. "Pasta" is not a badly formed category, nor are "RPGs". People will expect something they are used to when you say "try this, it's a sort of pasta". And if it's not the pasta they are used to, they will know. Some will be polite and regret eating it later, some will complain and some will say "hey, this exotic stuff is amazing!" <br/><br/>So my point is that if you've got something quite different from a trad game and it's not meant to be played as a trad game, don't sell it as an option for playing <i>a sort of</i> trad game. Because from a lot of comments I've been reading around in this forum and a few others, there still seems to be an awful lot of players misunderstanding "RPGs" for "Trad Games", when, as you truthfully say and I agree, the actual spectrum of the hobby is much much larger than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377244/#Comment_377244" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T21:52:24+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  9:52PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2012 9:52PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...I think "trad games" is actually the badly formed category due to the huge variety of styles of games, approaches and play present even in that category...the amount of innovation in the hobby has always been about the same: ridiculously huge...but I think I get what you mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377311/#Comment_377311" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-09T11:39:57+00:00" title="May  9, 2012 11:39AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>Paolo, I think the primary problem is that, for decades, there has existed "prevailing wisdom" that game texts are irrelevant, system doesn't matter, and all you need is a good GM. I think this has less to do with terminology and more to do with the evolution of game design and procedures of play.<br/><br/>We've had about a decade or so of discussion now that has challenged all of that prevailing wisdom. Game design has evolved, as have the attitudes we have towards games both old and new (hello OSR). My preference is to adopt these new attitudes and play these new (and old) games.<br/><br/>I think it's all slowly trickling into the mainstream.</blockquote>\nI think this is one of the most useful and relevant quotes to come out of this conversation.

But if you ask 'how are these similar' ... I think you'll also find a lot.<br/><br/>Kind of embarrassed to repeat it since it put me right over the edge. It was Ghost/Echo. I posted details in one of the Ghost/Echo threads that should still be near and dear. Actually, the first time I played Dogs it was with a clueless DM, too.<br/><br/>Thank you for noting that there are, in fact, many similarities between those games. (I prefer IAWA, by the way.

(And, of course, be willing to learn and try something new, which is the MOST important part, and one that no amount of text will help with).<br/><br/>I'm not trying to be dismissive of the general GMing tools idea, but it does sound like a mechanical/procedural solution to a social problem, which are rarely successful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377514/#Comment_377514" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T10:23:55+00:00" title="May 10, 2012 10:23AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Brian, you are correct in that mechanical solutions to social problems are rarely effective (unless they're propoganda, in which case they're merely backing up or focussing attention on a much larger and well-resourced social or political movement.)<br/><br/>One of the things I was going to put on the list was "Read the Rules," but in fact Buzz's rather nice summation earlier in this thread gave me some clear arguments I can throw around when I need to talk to people one-on-one in order to convince them that reading the rules has "suddenly" become a good idea.<br/><br/>What I'm thinking of doing now is putting together my own sheet, like I might for a debate, something that helps me focus and perhaps provide positive encouragement rather than letting myself get overwhelmed by frustration. But I need strong arguments to do so - and, once again, as little jargon as possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16473/instant-new-gm-education" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16473/instant-new-gm-education" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/16473/instant-new-gm-education/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16473%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F16473%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
