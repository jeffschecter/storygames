In practice the game events ended up being rather clique-ish, and disparity in timing expectations resulted in people sitting around waiting for people to show up and get back from dinner.<br/><br/>I remember a point though, when even the whiteboard with names of games on it was considered 'too organized' by some, functioning as some sort of nebulous tyrannical structure.  Maybe that worked when Forge Midwest was a lot smaller, but the con has increased greatly in size.<br/><br/>I want to stick with the Playcon roots and keep things casual, while providing enough of a structure that people can reasonably find games.  To that end, there will be no pre-con scheduling and signup of events: its okay to say you are bringing game X and want to run it at the con, and it's even okay to say you'll run it Friday or that you'd like to play in said game, but please no calling dibs.<br/><br/>There will certainly be no little con booklet with and event listings.<br/><br/>The timeslots are morning, afternoon, evening, and late nite.  The exact numbers need some looking at: what hours do people play anyways, given their druthers?  Something like 9-1, 2-7, 8-midnite, midnite-onward is probably best: if you want a longer dinner break, stop your afternoon game before 7.  People will be strongly encouraged to plan their games around these times. <br/><br/>(This is crossposted with the <a href="http://forgemidwest.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/timeslots/" rel="nofollow">Forge Midwest Blog</a>.

Remi's idea is that we won't pre-plan any events, but people who have things to run will announce them during that half hour as the meal is cleaned up. So you'll say "I am ready to run World of Synibarr, I can take up to six players, who is interested?" and who-plays-what will then get sorted. Atleast I think that's the plan! Like I said it is a new idea.<br/><br/>I should point out that we communally provide all meals at Nerdly, and in the past people on cleanup detail often got screwed out of getting in a game because they had to do their jobs with an overlap in game time. That will 100% not happen this year. It's a circumstance that is semi-unique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_375532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375532/#Comment_375532" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-01T12:36:55+00:00" title="May  1, 2012 12:36PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2-3 hours per event is pretty tight.
