                    It just occurred to me that these books may be of interest to somebody - I'm re-playing/re-reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0891416358/002-2670962-8532024" rel="nofollow">Combat Team:  The Captain's War</a> (I went through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/089141536X/002-2670962-8532024" rel="nofollow">Infantry Combat:  The Rifle Platoon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0891413839/002-2670962-8532024" rel="nofollow">Armor Attacks:  The Tank Platoon</a> years ago).  These are all a weird combination of choose-your-own-adventure and tactical how-to manual - barely accessible to armchair warriors at all, terribly unforgiving, a little corny but fascinating as well.  There's a pretty deep tradition of programmed solo adventures (even solo games, a la Fighting Fantasy), and Antal's books certainly have enough game-ness to them to pique my interest.  After exploring the good (and bad) decisions and outcomes, I feel like I've got a better idea how to handle myself the next time I have to mount an armor-based counter-attack against North Korea, anyway.  I wonder how this format could be re-purposed to, say, teach somebody how to play a new game, or how to behave in a role-playing game group, or how to set stakes or something.                </div>

                            The Steve Jackson Car Wars Solo Adventure books got me thinking the same thing. Though closer to video games in the narrow options, books that are dependent on outside elements like dice and a character sheet are an excellent introduction to players.  I remember a short scenario like that in the red box D&amp;D. A little intro to how the game progresses.<br/>
<br/>
How can you use it to teach behavior? That seems difficult. Generally these books teach only the gamist angles. Roll this die, advance the page. The elements outside the game are also outside the book. <br/>
<br/>
Could it be made more social as a "book club." Reader/players are encouraged to meet with others to learn more about how their story interacts with others. Like video game expansions that show the other side of a story (I'm thinking Half Life, Opposing Force, and Blue Shift here.)<br/>
<br/>
Certainly food for thought.                        </div>

                            The Captain's War has a ton of leadership-related stuff in it - there are subtle cues in the various sections about the nonverbals your subordinates are throwing, and choices you make directly impact their morale.  For example, your XO immediately gives you shit, but if you don't work it out, you fail, hard, because he's the guy who's been with the unit and knows everybody's strengths and weaknesses, and you don't.  So you come away with some instruction on positive leadership skills, albeit in a crude format.                        </div>

EXACTLY, and that's the problem.  Traditionall, LOTS of games have the choose-your-own adveture (Star Wars and TORG and Ghostbusters and ... er... lots).<br/><br/>However, Jason's thoughts on making them emphasize good gaming kinda hits an interesting nerve.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------<br/><b>GAMEMASTER QUEST</b><br/><br/>The Players sit down at the table to play, and begin the light talk and snack-eating. Today is the day that you were to bring AwesomeQuest with you and run it for the other players.  This is the First Night. You know the rules back and forth. You have 1-2 quick-play scenarios at your disposal that came with the book that you're familiar with, and some pre-generated characters. Unfortunately, none of the other players are currently familiar with the rules or setting of the game.<br/><br/>Soon, the talking quiets and stops, and all eyes are on you. What do you do?<br/><br/><i>If you give them a breakdown of the setting and rules before play to get them fully into what the game is about, turn to section 51.<br/><br/>If you jump right into a scenario, handing out characters and explaining the rules as needed to kick off the game while easing them into play, turn to section 74.<br/><br/>If you brief them on the gist of the rules and setting and ask the players for what kind of campaign and characters they want to play, turn to section 94.</i><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            For reals.  <br/><br/>I want to play through GameMaster Quest where I get to push and pull and see what happens, then go back and do the opposite.  Maybe that's not as efficient as digesting a lengthy treatise or playing with somebody clueful, but I have a short attention span and no clueful people around, because I am 13 and live in Shaktoolik, Alaska.                        </div>

                            Tunnels and Trolls of course was the king of CYOA. There were some CYOA books for Tekumel (which actually made an attempt to teach players about the world, and unveil some of the current events).<br/>
<br/>
I want to say that I've seen an RPG that introduced some very basic rules, and then presented a CYOA to allow the players to apply those rules, and then move forward to the full rules set.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that strikes me, having just been talking a lot about character death and the resulting non-play time, an interesting application of CYOA would be in chargen to give the player something engaging for an hour or so until it's easy to work his PC into the game (a cool bit would be to make heavy use of computers, and actually have the CYOA lead the new PC directly into the game, with the GM inputting the live play into the computer so it could tell them when the new PC shows up).<br/>

                            Lone Wolf are those Choose-Your-Own adventure books from the 80s that were essentially a one-player RPG experience.  Instead of "By Page", the breakdown was "By Section", and there were about 250-350 sections per book (sometimes 1-3 sections per page).<br/><br/>Also, you would make up a character by selecting various abi...whattaminute, YOU DON'T KNOW LONE WOLF???!!! For shame!<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Wolf_%28gamebooks%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Wolf_(gamebooks)</a><br/><br/>What we're talking about sounds more like Lone Wolf, but teaches good gaming. My Gamemaster Quest was kind of a joke, but probably not too far from the goal.<br/><br/><b>While the rest of your characters start down into the Tomb of Dead Heroes, James hesitates. "Kitclawyer would totally not go down in the cave. It's against my character."  He's been doing this kind of shit all night.  What do you do?<br/><br/>If you bear it, hoping that the GM finds things for James' character to do above the ground, go to 53.<br/><br/>If you suggest that the GM finds a reason for Kitclawyer to descend with the rest of the characters, go to 19.<br/><br/>If you say, "What the fuck, James? C'mon, you're messing with your vibe. Why not just make your character a little more impulsive so that he joins us? Otherwise we'll just be holding our dicks here.". go to 33.</b><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            There's an introductory CYOA in GURPS 3e, at least the printing I have.  I can't find it for some reason, but I'm super interested in the language and assumptions it uses to prepare you to play the game.                        </div>

You are personally responsible for my complete lack of porductivity for the last week as I replayed the entire (web-published) Lone Wolf books.  I don't know if I got anything out of it except that Gary Chalk is a very fine illustrator.  I hope you're satisfied.                        </div>

<p>Yes, I'm <em>extremely</em> pleased they could include Mr. Chalk's illustrations online, it really makes the books.</p>
<p>Damn, that's a lot of Lone Wolf. Did you properly do all the RPG-style paperwork and rolling as you read them? Or better, did you start over upon death or just click "back"?</p>

                            First of all, "this rules.":http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/LoneWolfActionChart  Man did that save me a lot of tedium with pencil and paper and dice and whatnot.  I mean, I'm reading the silly books on my laptop in bed at 3AM, why not use a little program to keep track of everything.  (Although I did find myself wishing for a little link to send commands to the Action Chart program.)<br/>
<br/>
Did I start over upon death?  You're kidding, right?  Hell, there are fights I didn't even bother rolling out, especially in one of the later Magnakai books, where the ratio is like -8, tops, and you can't avoid the fight.  And there was a least one "if you go left, you just die." that I clicked back from.<br/>
<br/>
Now, granted that as a kid I didn't bother with the combat, and I kept my place while I searched for the next entry, so to a certain degree I feel morally superior.  And more engaged.  It certainly hurt my pride when I died, even if I just bumped back a section.                        </div>

                            Here's an interesting attempt to revive the programmed adventure format:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.darkcitygames.com/<br/>
<br/>
...these guys are selling a number of PA style modules, inspired by the old Fantasy Trip modules which were also done in a PA format.  They have a (mostly playable) download of their rule set, which is an attempt to be TFT compatible but not pure TFT (since there are rights problems), and they have a short adventure you can download in the PA format in addition to the ones they sell.<br/>
<br/>
The most interesting thing about the old TFT adventures and these new ones is that they were designed with the idea that you'd have several players working together to go through the PA, with either no GM, or a GM whose only real task was to play the opposition in set piece battles.  I ran the free one a couple weeks ago, and a one player said, "it's like playing Gauntlet on the tabletop."<br/>
<br/>
I also bought one of their for pay games and its very good quality POD.                        </div>

                            I loved those things, and have to agree that they had (and have!) application in teaching RPGs.  The mid-80s (Larry Elmore cover) Red Box D&amp;D set did have a short one to help teach the game, but it was loaded with typical bad D&amp;D adventure silliness -- no logic to the dungeon setup whatsoever.  And it suffered from the emphasis on "shoot 'n loot" dungeoneering.<br/>
<br/>
The original version of 3rd edition GURPS also had an introductory programmed adventure, though it was stuck in the back of the book as an appendix.  I've played it a couple of times -- it was better than the D&amp;D one, with a more logical setup and structure, but still had a "shoot 'n loot" style.<br/>
<br/>
Circa 1990, D&amp;D had a "big black box" set, with a system for learning the game that was essentially a series of programmed adventures.  However, the set was meant to take a newbie from knowing nothing about the game, up to being a GM.  I seem to recall it having some cards that were "programmed GMing", with the player being asked how they'd decide certain kinds of things...  I think I'll dig that out tonight and post more about it later.<br/>
<br/>
And on the DVD front, there's already a D&amp;D-branded DVD programmed adventure (although it doesn't teach how to play, and is more a pick-a-path thing):  Scourge of Worlds.  Reviews I've seen have been very mixed, depending on what people were expecting.                        </div>

                            I have "First Quest," one of the sundry AD&amp;D2 for newbies sets. It comes with and audio CD you're suppsed to listen to at certain points in the tutorial book. The player voices on CD lead me to believe this set was targeted at 12-year olds. Maybe I'll pull it off the shelf to see how "programmed" it was.<br/>
<br/>
TSR made a bunch of CD-enhanced modules in this vein, but they were more standard keyed module rather than programs.                        </div>
