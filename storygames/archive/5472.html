It's pretty much the Norwegian answer to what the No Press Anthology did some years back, and I'd like to hear more about people's experiences with <i>that </i>book as a reference point.<br/><br/>So. Did you ever hear about the No Press Anthology? Did you buy the book? Did you play any of the games?<br/><br/>If you were involved in the project, what did you think of it? What worked? What didn't? What would you do differently?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122609/#Comment_122609" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T02:37:24+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  2:37AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think most of the authors post here semi-regularly. <a href="http://www.nopress.net" rel="nofollow">Nopress site</a> for those who are unaware of the book.<br/><br/>For creators it was a great project to test the waters of publishing. For a consumer it was a nice mix of different tastes, and I reckon quite a good intro to this style of games. It was in Leisure Game's top Indie sellers and found its way to plenty of gameshops via Key20.<br/><br/>Luke did an amazing job of holding disparate elements together. So having a strong project manager is definitely key.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122617/#Comment_122617" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-29T03:26:15+00:00" title="January 29, 2008  3:26AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have it, and I love it.

I remember pimping it to a bunch of people over on RPGnet at about the time the link to the pdf went down. Now, even though it's only 20 bucks, I haven't really had the drive to purchase it for, effectively, one game of 8 games. (Ok, Pagoda I've heard good things about, too.)<br/><br/>Still, good to hear that it was a success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
