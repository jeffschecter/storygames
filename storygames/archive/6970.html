Co-opting a line from Edison: Hooray! Failure <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>Nick was my guinea pig. Nick has never played RPGs before. We just recruited him for our regular D&amp;D game, and he was kind enough to give me some time for the playtest.<br/><br/>I wanted to test out three main areas: character creation, the core challenge system, and the detail system I <i>just</i> came up with.<br/><br/>Nick\u2019s a fan of Jason Bourne and wanted to do that. He\u2019s specifically listed as a suggestion for predator, so I was down with it. He tweaked his own version of Bourne. On one of his early assignments, he accidentally killed an innocent bystander, a women. He got a migraine when he went to carry out the hit and hit the woman instead. Nick wrote up some details for his version of Bourne in the Personal Dossier, e.g., \u201cjust wants to be left alone\u201d, \u201cwill not kill innocent women and children\u201d, \u201chaunted by the accidental shooting\u201d, etc. Naturally, I seized on that in making my character. I played a head of the Russian mafia, whose wife was the women Bourne killed, leaving me with our five-year-old son. I wanted revenge. I gave myself the nice Russian-y name of Vladimir Roskov. The only hiccup is that the rules call for assigning at least two assets (which are resources external to the character). Nick, at first, had some trouble coming up with assets for Bourne. In the end, he went with a Swiss bank account and assigned it two dice. (That was a quick and obvious change on the fly, i.e., allowing multiple dice for one asset.) Character creation took about 20 minutes, which is what about what I\u2019m targeting.<br/><br/>We started with the introductory scene, which is where the predator narrates something from his past in a free-form manner. Nick went with the restaurant scene, of course. I rolled 1 Glitch against his Psych (3). Amazingly, I won 1 point of Friction out of the scene. We concluded by establishing our detail dice. Nick went with \u201cMy migraine led to the death of an innocent women\u201d, and I jumped on \u201cYou killed my wife\u201d. A nice start so far.<br/><br/>I decided on a minor challenge for the next scene. Nick said that Bourne was trying to live under the radar in a busy city in China. For the challenge, I had narrowed the trail to that city, and I had sent two men to try and track Bourne down. We set the scene in a crowded subway station. We assembled our dice pools and allocated them to the four phases: Vision, Motion, Impact, and Surge. Since this was a minor challenge, Nick started in Control, and I only had 8 dice to his 15. He won the Vision phase and narrated how he spotted the two operatives, one of their weapons, and their likely nationality based upon the make of the weapon. He spent his net successes on identifying a weapon of convenience\u2014a magazine some businessman was reading. Nick won the Motion phase and narrated how he grabbed the magazine and rolled it up as he made his way to the first operative. He used his net success to claim the weapon of convenience, gaining a bonus die in the Impact phase. Nick had invested big in Impact, looking to end it quickly. He did just that and narrated how he got the drop on the first operative, took him out with the magazine, pulled the operative\u2019s gun and used it to plug two big, nasty holes in the second operative. No Glitches for me. I added a second detail die with \u201cYou opened fire in public\u201d, and Nick advanced his existing detail die.<br/><br/>Next we tried a major challenge. I narrated that we used the security tapes from the subway incident and additional intel to track Bourne down at his apartment. I sent a full strike team in. We assembled our dice pools. Since this was a major challenge, I started with 12 dice, and the Control Marker was set at equal. Summarizing, the challenge went back and forth. The main strike team set off Bourne\u2019s perimeter security in the stairwell, but I also had a sniper to stakeout the planned escape route. Bourne made a break for it, breaking into the apartment across the hall, where the owner was on vacation. He tried to get out the fire escape there, but the owner had put bars on the window. As the strike team advanced, they set off a perimeter charge. Bourne was able to get out and take out the last team member posted at the front entrance. I scored 3 Glitches and converted them to 2 Friction.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a great success. Chargen was breezy. The challenges worked out pretty well. I identified one major, but eminently fixable problem with the challenge rules. The detail look like they are going to work for exactly the purpose intended. A fine maiden voyage for the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155241/#Comment_155241" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-07T13:03:50+00:00" title="July  7, 2008  1:03PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what was the big failure?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.
