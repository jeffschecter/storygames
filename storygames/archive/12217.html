Antagonistic GM'ing make players reactive and that's no fun. I bet it's possible to start out with highly player driven play too but other games do that better.<br/><br/>Anyway, the good part was the stark contrasts. The time spend on the ship was like perpetual prison riot while planets were quiet, almost meditative exploration (much thanks to the background music) and combat became very personal and fast with everyone nearly dying in the first encounter thanks to some bad rolls and overdosing combat drugs.

Thing is, the hardholder's lead bodyguard, a badass named Doghead, has his eyes on H and won't take no for an answer. It's only a matter of time before he gets what he wants, and it's implied every time Doghead comes up in conversation that Doghead's attentions are...unsavory.<br/><br/>At a loss for what to do to protect H, Gitch does the most logical thing...he lights up his room-sized hookah made of junkyard parts and gets really *really* stoned. <br/><br/>One of the Savvyhead powers when you have a workshop lets you do stuff with the Psychic Maelstrom beyond the usual Q&amp;A session. In this case, Gitch decides to "isolate and contain part of the Psychic Maelstrom".<br/><br/>Which part? Doghead's lust, of course. So now Doghead is a bit less frisky, and Gitch's hookah has this purple bruiselike cloud of lust swirling around inside it. <br/><br/>What could possibly go wrong!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273852/#Comment_273852" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T14:10:02+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  2:10PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our Sunday group seriously needs to get "Story Games: What Could Possibly Go Wrong?" tee-shirts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273853/#Comment_273853" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-01T14:10:22+00:00" title="June  1, 2010  2:10PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ColinC</cite>Apocalypse World...<br/><br/>What could possibly go wrong!</blockquote>\nIf you're doin' it right, everything will go wrong.

After months of striving to keep three artifacts away from the avatar of a exiled god, Koraa the orc fighter, wielder of the Infernal Device, the sword artifact, has a dream where another orc "shows her the truth" of the exiled god and "peels away the lies" her friends have been sold on.  By the end of the "revelation", the player seemed to buy into it rather than play it cagey for no other reason than this was almost certainly the sword and because it was saying something different than the rest of the world, it must be lying.  woot for intrigue in epic fantasy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274403/#Comment_274403" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T20:14:03+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  8:14PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2010 8:19PM by orklord.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Played the second half of our first Mouse Guard mission.

The patrol found him in the woods with two other mice in armor, a fight ensued and the Mouse Guard prevailed.<br/><br/>The highlight was the interrogation of Sparrow, where all three players tried to fulfill their disparate goals ("make an example of the traitor" vs. "find out how deep the treachery goes" vs. "prove I am a worthy Guard Mouse to my new patrol-mates").  This ended up with a bad cop - good cop - neutral cop routine and back-to-back conflicts with Sparrow during the Player's Turn.

As a result I couldn't get any information out of NPCs about the situation and eventually, when death came at the hands of the cultists, it was a blessed relief.<br/><br/>In Cold City, at the same con, we were doing a little house call on a shady undertaker. There was a radio controlled combat gorilla in his hall so I shut the door and when the ape came bounding through it, I stepped to one side and set light to it use my flask of VSOP (no rubbish) and a cigarette.

After some killing, we have the choice of escaping to fresh air and blue sky, or fucking around trying to steal their treasure. Me and the elf vote to GTFO; the dwarf and Shane Jackson opt to follow the dodgy NPC "who knows where the treasure is hidden". <br/><br/>Cue the giant mechanical insects and bone-flaying aberrations as the greedy bastards fall into some horrible cult-y trap - the green men  transformed their very treasure into murderous magical guardians of itself! Somehow the dwarf manages to crawl, bloodied, after me and the elf as we prepare to climb out of the death-pit. He's had a hate-on for me all night and we throw down.

The setup is, all the characters are in on a plan to save Billy the Kid from imminent hanging, and to represent this plan without wasting game time discussing it, everyone has the ability to make statements about the world (which they can use to their advantage) to reflect the planning their characters have done.<br/><br/>So, after Doc Scurlock's (played by Paul) son tries to turn them in to the authorities, Lawrence (John Harper) decides he's had enough of this and rides back to town, into the arms of a lady he wooed with some fancy shooting earlier. We play for a bit, then I say: "So, the next morning when you wake up in her room." John's all "actually, I'm not there. Go back to everyone else."<br/><br/>So we play for a bit, I keep offering John scenes, he keeps saying he's fine, stick with everyone else. Finally, as the train carrying Billy is headed towards the ambush point, John pushes forward his tokens and says "I'm using my ability to make true statements about guns, the military, and war: the car ahead of Billy's has some cavalry men in it, and I'm there dressed as one of them.

They find two orcs pretty deep within that are on the brink of death from thirst and starvation and instead of killing them there is a tense moment of backing up and letting them out and even sharing a food ration.

Our basic premise was that every Atlantean was born into slavery and had to work their way out over the course of 100 years to become a freeman. The city itself was an architectural marvel built into an atoll, with its lower levels and bowels dug way down below sea-level, holding back the water with stone and buttresses.  We had:<br/><br/>-- Jackson (a 300+yo judge/astronomer who was our chief supporter of the status quo)<br/>-- Matt (the recently arrived Greek ambassador being blown off by the High Architect and his staff)<br/>-- Joe (the apprentice of the High Architect, dressing as him because the Architect is dead and no one in the city can know)<br/>-- Lesley (a priestess charged with reading the city's future in as annual festival, who has visions of its destruction)<br/>-- Lukas (a gladiator and leader of a potential slave revolt, killer of hundreds, who just earned his freedom)<br/>-- Shannon (a Roman immigrant scientist and physician, studying the killer plague and hopful of earning full Atlantean status)<br/>-- Daniel (the High Architect's estranged wife, a designer of rituals masks and perhaps the one really responsible for his work)<br/>-- me (a member of the specially-marked elites, born free, but sentenced to slavery for a crime; I killed the High Architect)<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/>-- Shannon and Lesley's characters straight-up murdering Lukas' gladiator and my creepy murderer dude.<br/>-- Joe and Daniel having an architecture fight, where Daniel's character ran up walls to draw diagrams in chalk while Joe's character impersonated the High Architect and flooded the cracks in the walls with flour paste.<br/><br/>The main regret was that we weren't able to finish on a high note, since it was getting late, my brain was ceasing to work, and we weren't able to play out the big festival where Lesley's priestess would reveal the city's doom.  But there was so much great stuff going on that I still found it really exciting.  Makes me want to play more Mist-Robed Gate, definitely.  I very much liked playing it in a non-Asian setting, since I study China-related stuff all day long for school.  And I kinda want to see more of our vision of Atlantis, which was really really fucking cool.  Maybe I'll have to write up a playset for MRG Atlantis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276921/#Comment_276921" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T00:34:00+00:00" title="June 20, 2010 12:34AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shab-al-Hiri Roach, NASCAR-style at GPNW.<br/><br/>It all seemed like a good idea until Dick Trickle walked in with a chainsaw.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276953/#Comment_276953" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T10:29:14+00:00" title="June 20, 2010 10:29AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GPNW: Finally got to try out <a href="http://plays-well.com/DangerSxool.pdf" rel="nofollow">Danger Sxool</a>, my Mouse Guard hack for running New Mutants-style junior X-Men.  I wrote it on a whim back in April 2009 before John released the Danger Patrol alpha, kinda as a joke, with Professor Danger as -- I guess -- a former Psychic Professor from the 1920s-1930s running a school for young supers.  But I'd never gotten to play it.<br/><br/>Like the MRG game, it was way more awesome that I could have guessed and, unlike last night's game, we were actually able to play it to a very satisfying conclusion and even figured out a few cool things about the hack as we went.  It helped I think that 2 players had played Mouse Guard and one had read it, but we threw down (with four folks I had never played with or really even talked to extensively) and it was really great.<br/><br/>The characters were:<br/>- (the) Armadillo, a kid from Texas with bony plates for skin<br/>- Hexen, a girl with shadow control who turned out to be a shadow demon princess pretending to be a normal girl<br/>- Red Shift, the team leader, with force field control, and<br/>- Hostile Takeover, a mind control specialist bound for business school<br/><br/>We started out <i>in media res</i> with the kids fighting the Dark Pharaoh in the destroyed remnants of the school.  They destroyed the ancient magically mummy king and it was revealed to be simply a simulation in the Danger Gym.  But the Danger Gym quickly malfuctioned, locking them inside to the dismay of the adult members of the Danger Patrol who were struggling to get the students out.  They fought their way through a jungle training program (set at a ludicrous XX difficult level meant for training the Patrol, not students) and discovered that an alien virus had corrupted the Gym and was hiding in the simulation inside a hologram of the Celestial Sphere of Water, a super-powered cosmic artifact.  Eventually, the students triumphed over the virus, thanks to Hexen pushing her powers negative, which forced her to take the condition "Revealed," showing her true form as a shadow demon princess.<br/><br/>The players were both thoughtful and hilarious and it makes me really excited to work on this hack again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276959/#Comment_276959" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T11:35:18+00:00" title="June 20, 2010 11:35AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GPNW: Gangster London Fiasco<br/><br/>James Brown, Johnstone and I play out a tale of a family business - an auction house owned by a good brother and a good-for-nothing brother and the girl whose dead gangster boyfriend's mysterious case got her into this whole mess.

Two other agents were more successful posing as EPA agents, and managed to sneak out of the fortified compound in Colorado with an armload of stolen files without any violence to speak of.<br><br>A few minutes later, just before we called it a night, the squad's computer hacker had been shot off an ATV and was bleeding out slowly in an isolated clearing in the forests just north of Chichibu, Japan. If we'd had to go through all the dire die-rolling and table-consulting mandated by the d20 system, we never would have been able to end on such a cool cliffhanger.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276997/#Comment_276997" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T19:09:58+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  7:09PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2010 7:11PM by Brian_Minter.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Storming the Wizard's Tower this weekend with two old friends with whom I used to play D&amp;D.

I ask Joel to describe the building.<br/><br/>"It's built on top of an old ammo dump!" Joel exclaims, "There's nothing between Samantha and thousands of pounds of high explosives but some rickety old boards!" We all know what Joel is selling, but Shane isn't buying.<br/><br/>Shane takes this in and looks at Samatha's Traits. "Rickety old boards? OK."<br/><br/>Samantha shouts "It's on now, bitch!" and the obligatory lady fight begins. She kicks the floor and grabs a length of plank that roughly approximates her college field hockey stick, deftly knocking the gun out of the frogwoman's hand with the old Pemberton double-fake. The Cuban villainess picks up a spear-tipped American flag, which brings out the furious patriot in Samatha Lonetree!

And he's made the gun pretty happy lately: he unloaded an entire clip on a cop's groin, and watched him bleed out. And he killed a couple more cops when they came calling, because once you kill a cop you've basically put yourself on an irrevocable path.<br/><br/>So, now, he's managed to escape momentarily. He's on a nearly empty subway car, with no cops around. Last scene, Grimsby chose "Get everything momentarily, and thenv die next scene."<br/><br/>Tabitha's on the subway car, somehow. That ex-lover who betrayed him earlier in the story. Maybe her and Grimsby are the only ones. (Mike Sugarbaker, playing The Law, narates that) Grimsby's gun starts heating up. Tabitha draws closer, speaking with an air of pity in her voice. That gun is burning through Grimbsy's thigh. Satan's trying to say something, here.<br/><br/>Tabitha reaches for the gun.

We did our usual dinner and then talked about where the characters were eight months ago before getting underway.  We played only for about 90 minutes and there was some nice story and color created but none of us were really feeling it.  I suggested the possibility of just calling it and David and Colin agreed.  We just talked about Apocalypse World and various books and movies.    We should get together to shoot the breeze more often.<br/><br/>This to say it is sometimes better to not "go play" if it means powering though a flat session.  It was a nice evening all in all.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278451/#Comment_278451" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T23:55:35+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 11:55PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Montsegur at GPNW:</b><br/><br/>Pierre Roger, captain of the defense at Montsegur and landless knight whose property was seized by the Crusaders, leads a sortie to strike the party of a new Crusader commander arriving to take over the direction of the siege. It is the young lad Amiel's first battle, after many weeks of tutelage in the ways of battle by Pierre's man Bernard. The boy has assisted in the laying of barbed tripwires to snare the horses and unseat their riders.<br/><br/>The mass of downed horses is lying screaming and thrashing in the mud, many riders trapped beneath. Pierre bends down to Amiel, places his hand on his shoulder, and asks: "Are you ready for your first kill by your own hand, boy?" Amiel gulps and nods. Pierre leads him to a pinned rider and bids him draw his sword. Pointing it at the man's throat, he bids the boy, "Steady now. Strike straight and quickly!"<br/><br/>The enemy knight looks up in horror. "No," he begs. "Not the boy, not the boy! I demand a knightly death! You, Pierre Roger, Pierre Roger! I know you. Let it be you that slays me, Pierre Roger!"<br/><br/>Pierre's eyes narrow. "You mistake me, <i>Crusader.</i> I am landless." and to the boy: "Strike straight and quickly!"<br/><br/>Amiel closes his eyes. Summoning up a memory of his dead father's strong hands, he finds strength within himself. He plunges the blade, blood gouts, and the man is dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278555/#Comment_278555" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T12:33:41+00:00" title="June 29, 2010 12:33PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2010 11:07AM by johnzo.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I DMed 4E for <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10633&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">this group</a> again.  Our third session in nine months.  They're all still first level.<br/><br/>I threw together a half-assed little skill challenge about navigating the bloodstream of the dead God of Trust, just a DC of 14 and a list of obstacles such as antibodies attacking them, platelets trying to seize them for use as artery-wall spackle, cataracts of red blood jetting out of the marrow, getting lost in a capiliary maze, etc, etc. <br/><br/>I was a little unsure about it, because skill challenges can go wrong in so many ways, but they rocked it!  They sewed little godskin-leather suits to hoodwink the antibodies, cauterized the arterial damage with Scorching Burst, and the mage with the weird invisible astral parasitic familiar narrated that her familiar was spawning, and that its young would serve to mark their trail and prevent them from accidentally doubling back.  <br/><br/>They made it safely to the god-kidneys, where they destroyed the Merged Pope's secret evilite mining operation.  What does the Merged Pope need with the evilite from a dead god?

This was my third play of the game and it was neat to see how it varied from the other two plays, and how it stayed the same.  <br/><br/>The last M1244 game I played passed on religion and war almost entirely, so I tried to hit those points hard at GPNW 2010.  \n<ul>\n<li>As Phillipa, I begged Lord Raimonde to evict the Cathars in the very first scene.  This prompted people to choose up sides, to decide who was a Believer and who was just a Catholic refugee or a follower of Raimonde.

The PCs fought in two major battles.  I took the simple and quick Savage Worlds Mass Battle system and bolted on the Heroic Opportunities from Legend of the Five Rings 1st edition.  If you got two raises in a round of battle, you could take the benefit in the Savage Worlds system.... or you could get a Heroic Opportunity!
