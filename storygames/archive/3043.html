Every PC should arrive at a group scene with an agenda they need to accomplish. When complete, they should OOC the GM their agenda is done.<br/>2. Every PC should look to deliver their agenda, then draw off other PCs to a small sidebar conversation if more specifics are needed.<br/>3. Every Player should draw up some tidbits, rumors and "impressions" that PCs observing their PC closely might gain from the 'summary mode'. This makes group scenes layered and interesting, though brief and full of many new questions.<br/><br/>Admittedly, greater minds than I have tried to make this dynamic work.<br/>What have you folks seen done to good effect?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast" title="Radaghast"><img alt="Radaghast" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/252/nT6IX77SIXBAG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Radaghast">Radaghast</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69503/#Comment_69503" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T00:54:37+00:00" title="May 16, 2007 12:54AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been a PBEM player for something like a decade, and nowadays I find myself slowly but inevitably shifting towards PBP games (play-by-post, boards/forums based games, or whatever you call 'em). It was unexpectedly easy to migrate from email/netmail (yes, we started in FidoNet when Earth was young) to something more organised: all the good things are still there, yet you get much more transparency and dynamics. The posts tend to be a bit shorter than those emails, but they don't have to be (an <a href="http://rpg.gameforums.ru/forums/showthreaded.php?Board=play158&amp;Number=694112" rel="nofollow">random real life example</a> here - not that you can read it, but you can see the size).<br/><br/>How about this: one of the games I am running right now has 10 (ten) players in it. They have not yet separated so in your words we only have scenes involving ten PCs and Lord don't make me count how many NPCs in them. Two more are getting their characters ready to join in. Maybe you should try it when you have a chance: it works for me, it might work for you.<br/><br/>As for your proposed solution, it looks good and steady, yet I doubt it'll work for me because stating my character's agenda explicitly and solidly is the best way to ruin <b>my</b> game (learnt the hard way). Perhaps someone less of an immersionist would give you a different opinion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
