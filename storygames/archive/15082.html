It's his own thing. A different and particular medium of communication. Dice, if present, are part of that communication, as are gestures, numbers of the sheets and facial expressions.<br/><br/>Example: Dogs in the Vineyard, a conflict.  You are against the GM, and you leave the conflict<br/><br/>Now, consider these two different cases:<br/>1) you leave the conflict, you lose, but you still had enough dice to go on. Maybe win.<br/>2) you leave the conflict, when you have really nothing left to fight.<br/><br/>In the "narrated fiction" (the spoken part of the story), they are the exact same case: you get the same fallout, the stakes go the same way. But we, at the table, we see your dice. That exact same decision take a completely different aspect. And this goes in the "story", too.<br/><br/>The dice in that case were the story. Part of it. <br/><br/>Something that I noticed, is that when I return to playing some freeform scenario like I played years ago, or games where I can easily say what my character(s) do, without mechanics to "weight it down"...  these decisions are weightless. It's "just talking", it's just telling a story to somebody. The mechanics in a rpg help give "weight" to what you do. Different weights. The amount of fan mail you spend on a conflict in PTA can tell me more about your character than half an hour of in-character talking.<br/><br/>Dice are not the only way, obviously. I played a lot of "principled freeform" scenario where you could give weight to what you did without using cards or dice. But there was SOMETHING that took their place. A list of numbered scenes. Some difficult decision. Consequences. It never was "do what you want". That is weightless.<br/><br/>And I played a lot of games were dice were used only as boring distractions, but that is simply bad game design.<br/><br/>[edit: crosspost with Misuba, funny how both of us thought of DitV...]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342853/#Comment_342853" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T17:33:09+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  5:33PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Moreno,</p>\n<p>I basically agree with you, except I <em>do</em> think that the story and the dice are different things.

They generally feel to me like they're a natural extension of putting my head into the fiction, because I think most of them are well designed to do that. So maybe I'm going prone or taking cover in a firefight. That's a mechanics decision and it's going to affect my dice rolling. But it's also going to add to the narrative. It's going to give me extra details to picture in my head about how things are happening.<br/><br/>If the mechanics decisions have lame awkward things in them, then they can be distracting. Say, for example, I could get a bonus for running in a crouch, but it didn't affect my running speed. So I'd want to exploit that by running in a crouch all the time, because it would benefit me mechanically. But that would look dumb in my head to picture this guy who was always crouching when he ran, just in case someone started shooting at him. Maybe it would make some sense if he was a recently discharged soldier with PTSD, but otherwise it would be totally weird and dumb.<br/><br/>So it's the same kind of thing with any sort of mechanics or dice decisions or card decisions or whatever. If they are reinforcing the fiction in a positive way and helping me engage with the fiction through my mechanics decisions, then they're good. If I feel like I'm "just playing the stupid card game part that doesn't really have anything to do with the story" then they're distracting.<br/><br/>It's challenging to tie the mechanics closely to the fiction so that they reinforce each other. It's good that you've identified that as an important thing to focus on in your design. That's the first step toward accomplishing the goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342864/#Comment_342864" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T19:22:09+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  7:22PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want a lot of immersion, "role-playing" and characterization, try to focus more on simple procedures tied to the colour or narrative, and less about tactically or mathematically optimal decision making. Fewer numbers and more tags or descriptors. <br/><br/>I feel the reason AW works on this front is that Moves are procedures tied to the fiction with a small amount of randomization built in. When you do X in the fiction, Y [constrained fictional response] is prompted from the MC. The 2D6 is part is randomization as creative constraint on the part of the players. The math is dead simple and extremely limited. Even Harm is extremely simple to handle mathematically and requires little handling time, and again, prompts the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_342899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342899/#Comment_342899" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T05:35:47+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  5:35AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kobutsu</cite>So, I've been thinking about cards, dice, stories and attention.

True attention is, kind of, being <i>single-minded</i>.<br/><br/>Pictures draw attention. Complex images holds it.<br/><br/>Movement draws attention.

But for some the mechanics feels disconnected from the fiction. You don't have to play this way, but many do... you pick your best skill and make something up to justify its use. You don't care about what is happening or feels right, just what you can convince people into accepting to optimize your odds of success. In Apocalypse World, you say what you do in the fiction and then the GM triggers moves that best fit those descriptions. Similar level of effort but makes a huge difference in terms of focusing on the fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn D&amp;D; 4E, it's also a question of momentum. It asks you to think 1 way, make decisions from an abstract tactical perspective when in combat the majority of the time, and then suddenly, change how the game has trained you to think, when playing skill challenges. It can be hard for people to suddenly switch gears.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you say story, what do you mean? Do you mean roleplaying something that feels like a TV show or movie? Do you mean immersing in the fiction and playing as if you and your character were one? Those 2 goals area at odds in my opinion. In say a TV show, you often fail towards success. Drama dictates decisions. But when you want to immerse in fictional worlds, when you want to make decisions as your character... the common conventions of dramatic stories can be an obstacle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342910/#Comment_342910" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T07:27:04+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  7:27AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm coming more from a board-gamey background. But I'm finding the whole story-game niche fascinating since I really want my  game designs to be more "tell a story" in nature, in the sense that when the game is over, I want to the player to feel like he's experienced something more of story as opposed to running the best efficiency engine. So take that background into consideration.<br>\n<br>\nBut I think that the more you include fancy mini-games and knobs to twiddle into a game (however cool they are), the natural inclination for players is to spend more time thinking about how to best "beat" the system to their advantage, and less about the story. Or if nothing else, a desire to play with the system and tinker with it to see what it does. Simple boring systems, or ones that aren't beatable, do let you focus on other things.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342918/#Comment_342918" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T09:42:00+00:00" title="September 15, 2011  9:42AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>OK, this has helped me clarify my thoughts. Let's see if I can write some of that down.</p>\n<p>Attention is limited, absolutely. But it's not <em>spent</em>, it's <em>allocated</em>, and can be re-allocated. We can pretty quickly switch our allocation of attention, and while there's some mental tax to doing so, it's not egregious.</p>\n<p>So, I've found, in my own experience of play, that there are games that you have to keep pushing to keep making goodness come out of (and they're great! and fun!) and there are games that pull you along, with a strange inexorable force, and goodness comes out of them (and they're also great and fun).</p>\n<p>When I think of the latter type of game, at this point I think of <em>Apocalypse World</em>. I wondered if this property arose from paying attention to the story over the dice. But I think that's not entirely what's at work. What I think is happening, for me when I play it, is that the mechanics, by which in this case I mean "using moves", takes you from story through a little decision-free randomization and back to story. To complete the mechanical action, you have to end up thinking about the story. And so, the game takes your attention and handles the allocation to dice and then back to story for you.</p>\n<p>So it's not about the fact that the dice are simple and decision-free, so much as it is that the mechanics ask you to think about the story <em>to even be able to use them</em>, at the last point in using them. They manipulate your focus, and leave it back on what you were talking about before the dice happened.</p>\n<p>End clarification.</p>\n<p>Jason, I don't want or intend to say one is better than the other, I'm just trying to explore how a game can lean more heavily on one or another. I want to understand why some games pull me along and others require me to always push them. I think this is at least <em>part</em> of it.</p>\n<p>John, when I say story, I mean all the stuff where you're saying what happens. Since I think in drama-oriented terms, I call it "story", but some other term might be more accurate. Clouds. Whatever.</p>\n<p>Scott, yeah, I think that too many decisions in the dice will possibly lead to you thinking about them in anticipation of rolling them, which can do weird things, but right now I don't think that it <em>necessarily</em> detracts from the story.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342919/#Comment_342919" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T10:12:13+00:00" title="September 15, 2011 10:12AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kobutsu</cite>Jason, I don't want or intend to say one is better than the other, I'm just trying to explore how a game can lean more heavily on one or another.

It's a densely complicated board game with story generating elements.<br/><br/>But yeah, if the system is feeding back into the fiction, sparking new ideas and assisting my creativity, then it's helping.<br/><br/>If the system is limiting me by taking away more options than it's revealing, then it's hurting. <br/><br/>If it's making me spend tons and tons of time on handling time that is not adding a porportional amount of awesomeness to the fiction, then it's hurting.<br/><br/>For example - Huckster spell casting in the old Deadlands system. It was neat because it had a lot of genre flavor - you drew cards and made a poker hand to cast your spell. Which was kind of neat. But it had a lot of handling time - I think you had to roll first, and then that would tell you how many cards you got, and then you would spend some time looking at your cards and making the best poker hand, which takes many seconds unless you're a huge poker fan. Then you had to look up the result and see how many bonuses you got from a straight instead of a flush. And then you had to go back and roll again for doing the damage.<br/><br/>So it had all that handling time. And all you got out of it was that you shot a beam of black magic energy at a guy and hurt them. That's it. It was, at the end of the day, basically just a simple skill test, except that the consequences for failure were more extreme, cause if you failed, you'd have to engage the negative consequences subsystem rather than just miss.<br/><br/>And I could totally see why they put it in there. Because it was dripping with flavor - the poker hand basically symbolized your quick duel of wits bargaining with a demon. But at the end of the day, you were basically just shooting someone in a fancy magic way, and it would take like 3 minutes of handling time to resolve. And you weren't really interacting with the demon, the way you might in Sorcerer, so it didn't really add anything there. So it was way too much complication for way too little payoff, as far as I'm concerned. So it hurt the gameplay more than it helped.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342945/#Comment_342945" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T12:14:09+00:00" title="September 15, 2011 12:14PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>So it was way too much complication for way too little payoff, as far as I'm concerned.</blockquote><p>Again, yes.
