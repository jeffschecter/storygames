I mean, you're just throwing off the responsibility of possibly saying no with a few cards.  What's so terrible about a a phrase that codifies that?  Maybe only allow it to be used a few times a game?  Like you're only allowed three "Hell No's" during one sitting?  I'm just thinking.  I think if someone is really invested in something the way it is, why force something different outta them?  Sometimes it's okay not to go with the flow, ya know?  It shows something.  No's can be powerful stuff.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
