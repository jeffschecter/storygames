                    For thousands of years, the Kingdom has beaten back the monsters lurking in its darkest corners, raided the abandoned dungeons where they dwelled, and slaying the beasts wherever they were found.<br/><br/>With the ascension of Good King George, however, we have seen the dawn of a new day.  Guided by his new bride, the drow queen Sabine, the King has outlawed violence against monstrous citizens of the kingdom and established an order of diplomats to visit the dungeons and collapsed castles where they dwell in order to make amends.<br/><br/>It is George's unique wisdom to understand that the so-called "monsters" really are people, too, driven into the inaccessible reaches of the kingdom by fear and ignorance.  Millenia of war have only served to oppress these poor souls, denying them the opportunity to own and till fields and raise their spawn in as much comfort as they could.  The only permanent solution to the situation was not annihilation and genocide, but coming together in the spirit of peace and understanding.<br/><br/>The job of George's Diplomats is not easy.  Generations of mistrust have turned the hearts of the monsters cold and hard, and what few stop to listen believe that a human king would extend an olive branch to their kind.  The situation is made even more difficult by the actions of a few diehard "adventurers" who refuse to let go of the ways of the past.  But still, no matter the history of violence or the continuing remnants of hatred, the diplomatic corps stands ready to create tomorrow by building bridges of hope, understanding, and mutual respect.                </div>

                            I thought about Dogs, but since I want them going into <em>dungeons</em>, not towns, and untangling rather elaborate and ridiculous situations by finding solutions, not plowing through conflicts to get their way, I don't think Dogs is really the right system.<br/><br/>And last night I considered the spinoff game: Yesterday's Monsters.  In answer to that age-old question, "What do you do with the little orc babies?" King George opened a series of orphanages for little monstrous tykes who lost their parents.  At the orphanage, baby monsters are taught how to integrate with society, get a job, and live in peace.  The education is actually top-notch, but the populace may not really be ready for the house next door to be occupied by a trio of green-skinned roomates.                        </div>

                            This is very cool, Joshua.<br/><br/>I think I'd want to try it with a slightly less enlightened king, or one a few generations later:<br/><br/>The dungeon is now effectively a colony, with governors from the surface, and garrisons of soldiers living miles underground. The mines are staffed by the old denizens, and the profits go almost entirely to the surface. The standard of living for these humanoid races _has_  gone up, since imports from the surface are also available. But, there are those among the dungeon denizens who feel that a return to the old ways would be better, or that the dungeon could make it better on its own, with control over its own trade and destiny. Unrest, bordering on insurgency and revolution. Founding Fathers of the Underdark meeting in secret and all that.<br/><br/>Royal Subterranean Diplomatic Corps + Dungeon Bush War + Dungeon Colonialism = Trilogy of noveau-hippie dungeon crawl fun!                        </div>

                            Heh. I've read WAY too much history to play this straight and idealistic. Because the question that leaps to my mind immediately is, "What's in it for King George?" And if he's marrying Drow, the answer seems pretty obvious: He's allying with external powers -- the monsters -- against internal rivals -- which, in context, is presumbly "adventurers" as a group.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that's it. Think for a minute: If you're a king, do you really want your kingdom overrun by high-powered, independent-minded heroes who go off into the badlands and return (if they return) laden with gold and magic? And who found their own feudal ministates when they reach tenth level?<br/>
<br/>
As long as the central government is weak and the monsters strong, then sure, it makes sense to subcontract out your security this way: It's basically a form of freelance feudalism, where a steady outbound stream of 1st-level wannabes (who don't cost the royal treasury anything) at least keeps the monsters busy and at best destroys the beasts and reclaims new areas for settlement. Adventurers who suppport themselves off what they loot are even more economical than feudal lords who support themselves off of their land.<br/>
<br/>
The English took advantage of this effect for much of the Hundred Years' War: When they didn't need any mercenaries at the moment, they dismissed them from service... on French territory, which they proceeded to loot on their own until the next time the English needed them. The French response, after Joan of Arc and the Wars of the Roses weakened the English enough, was to hire the surviving mercenaries into the first real standing army in Europe, the gendarmes -- and proceed to turn them against disobedient feudal lords.<br/>
<br/>
Once a king gets strong enough, his first order of business is to crush independent power centers -- especially heavily-armed ones. Making peace with the monsters cuts the adventurers off from their source of revenue (loot), and it opens up the possibility of alliances with a now-weakened outside force, the monsters, against internal rivals. Remember how often monarchs hire foreign mercenaries as their personal bodyguards because their fellow-countrymen can't be trusted, while foreigners don't have any relatives with claims to the crown and often can't even speak the language of potential co-conspirators: The Byzantine Emperor had his Varangian Guard, King David had Uriah the Hittite, the Philistine kings had David before he became king of Israel and turned on them, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So "subterranean diplomatic corps" missions might include escorting Drow "advisors" (Queen Sabine's cousins) safely to the royal palace, hiring contingents of orcs and hobgoblins for the royal army, and negotiating with evil sorcerers for powerful magics.<br/>
<br/>
To push this a little further, the fact that King George is strong enough to even try this suggests that there are new sources of power in the kingdom that are capable of competing with the loot from adventuring. Perhaps the underlying dynamic is a clash between the traditional rural, feudal elite -- warriors whose power is based on loot and landholding, whether of inherited estates or new land reclaimed from the monsters -- and the rising, urban, merchantile elite -- whose power is based on trade, both locally and with foreign (monstrous) cultures, and whose loyalty is to the king.<br/>
<br/>
What I presume has happened is that the adventurers have reclaimed enough land over the generations that there is now a critical mass of agricultural population, living in a sufficiently secure (monster-free) environment, to support significant trade. Once trade tackes off, it tends to grow exponentially. The society's making a transition from extensive, low-density development to intensive, high-density development: The former assumes a fairly fixed number of people per square mile, all farming, and requires a constant territorial expansion to allow for population growth; the latter can support ever-higher concentration of people per square mile, in cities, as long as the trade routes flourish and allow different regional economies to specialize in different things and achieve higher effeciencies of production.                        </div>

                            Dave, Fred (Vaxalon), thank you. And Dave, we cross-posted, I realize. There IS indeed a great deal of juicy story goodness in exploring all the dynamics on the "monster" side. Presumably there are rival power centers in the dungeons, too, some of which see advantage in allying with the humans against other monsters.<br/>
<br/>
And, everyone, please note that I'm not saying that Good King George ISN'T an idealist. He may be acting from the highest possible motives. It's just that history teaches us that, while individuals may act out of idealism, they can't get very far if the underlying economics make their ideals infeasible. The fact that the northern states of the US only got serious about abolishing slavery after they'd found it economically inferior to free-hold farming, trans-Atlantic trade, and manufacturing doesn't make the abolitionists less idealistic: It just made it possible for them to succeed.                        </div>

                            Most of history is both tragedy and comedy. I went to a talk by historian Simon Schama on his new book a few months ago, and he mentioned that Patrick Henry -- Mister "Give me liberty or give me death!" -- had once been challenged, well then, why do you yourself own slaves? To which Patrick Henry replied, yes, it's certainly an inconsistency, and morally unjustifiable, but "I find myself unable to live without the convenience." Laugh so you don't cry.<br><br>People = self-contradictory.<br/><br/>Which brings me round to the analysis I couldn't help myself from making of the socio-political response to Good King George's policies, assuming a bog-standard "fantasy kingdom" of the usual Tolkein/early edition D&amp;D/Renaissance Faire mismash variety:<br/><br/>Nobles: Strong negative<br/>	For the feudal class of warrior-landholders, making peace with the monsters is an unmitigated disaster, because you can no longer send your younger sons off to the borderlands as "adventurers" to win gold, land, and glory for your house by their valor in arms (or die trying and at least stop scheming against their elders over the inheritance). And worse, since the new peacemaking overture is controlled by the King, and likely to be profitable for the merchant class (see below), the new policy doesn't just close off a major avenue of expansion for the nobility, it also opens new avenues of expansion for their political and social rivals.<br/>	In D&amp;D terms, this means that the kingdom's largest contingent of "fighters" is going to be at best grudgingly obedient and at worst violently opposed to the King's policies. And to the extent that the more martially inclined branches of the clergy (i.e. the cleric class) and the magicians' guilds (i.e. magic-users) are likely to be recruited from the nobility as well, those groups will also be opposed. The strongest opposition of all, verging on open revolt, will be from crusading orders whose entire existence is dedicated to, and justified by, eradicating the monstrous threat: rangers and paladins.<br/>	The main exception to this opposition will be border lords: While often the sons or grandsons of adventuring heroes, they're not necessarily heroic themselves, and they didn't come to the frontier to win their fortunes, they inherited their frontier baronies and now they have to live there. Such nobles will have already made their own accomodations with the "monsters," varying widely from wary coexistence to active appeasement to mutual cooptation of one kind or another -- this is where you get all those evil barons in D&amp;D modules who hire orkish mercenaries or consort with dark sorcerors -- and King George's new policy could make those accomodations a lot easier. The potential price is that any local deals get swept up in the King's new grand bargain, and the border lords' independence goes with them. This sub-set of the nobility is likely to be deeply ambivalent about peace.                        </br></br></div>

                            [continued]<br/><br/>Merchants: Strong positive<br/>	For every merchant who prospers because of some free-spending adventurer back in town with a haul of gold, another goes bust because his trade partner on the other side of the human-goblin border just got killed, or simply because all that precious metal infused into the economy causes unpredictable spurts of inflation. And that's the commercial consequences of successful dungeon-delving: Unsuccessful adventurers tend to provoke retaliatory hordes, which are bad for business all around. Businessmen like predictability, and peace is much more predictable than war, so businessmen are going to favor a peace policy.<br/>	The sub-category of merchants who are going to be especially enthusiastic about peace is what we might call the "far traders": Merchant-adventurers in the mold of Marco Polo or the East India Company who send expeditions far beyond the borders of what their own country can keep safe to trade for luxury goods with alien cultures. There's simply no way these traders can do business in any lasting way without hiring at least some "monsters" as local guides and, in all probability, buying off some of the tribes/dragons/unspeakable elder things along the way to let them pass. Every time an adventuring party goes out and starts killing monsters and taking their stuff, a far trader loses valuable contacts. Even if new territory is opened for settlement, the colonists are neither a good enough market, nor knowledgeable enough about the trade routes beyond their local area, to replace the monsters. So far traders are going to be the interest group most fervently in favor of making peace with the monsters -- and, since anyone who can make a steady business of such high-risk long-distance trade has to have impressive talent, connections, and resources, and will be making considerable profits, these merchants are likely to be among the richest and most powerful in the land. The minor irony of their situation is that most of the clients for their luxury goods are the feudal nobility, who are among the strongest opponents of the peace policy, and that most of their enterprises probably started when some adventurer decided to stop killing and start trading.<br/>	For merchants in less adventurous areas of business, who buy and sell within the kingdom's borders rather than beyond them, the peace policy is a good thing on general principles, but it is does not bring much immediate profit. Their support for King George is probably based on broader issues, namely a desire for a strong, central authority to impose peace on the squabbling feudal lords and, almost as important, to break down the authority of those local lords to impose tariffs and other trade barriers. Most big-city merchants are going to know awfully little about life out on the frontier -- which is ironic because it is their sons, as well-educated supporters of the King, who are most likely to volunteer for the Royal Subterranean Diplomatic Corps. (Hello, player characters!)<br/><br/>Borderers: Weak positive<br/>	Like the border lords who rule them (see above), the common folk of the borderlands have had to learn to live with "monsters" as neighbors, and if they've survived, it's because they've learned to roll with the tide. When bold adventurers ride into their villages on white steeds to liberate them from chaos and evil, everyone cheers, introduces them to their daughters, and parades the mothers of half-orcs through the streets with their hair shaved off so little kids can pelt them with rotten vegetables. When bold orkish warriors ride into their villages on silver wolves to liberate them from oppression and evil, everyone cheers, introduces them to their daughters, and mentions that, "you know, I'm one-half half-orc on my mother's side, myself."<br/>	For these people, who actually have to live with a peace policy, it's a welcome change from being fought over -- but like anything the far-off central government tries, it's also hard to have any trust in it, or in the idealistic young city folk who come out to try to make it work.<br/><br/>Bureaucracy: Moderate positive<br/>	To the extent that a royal standing army and civil service even exist -- which, for most real-life medieval and Renaissance kingdoms, varied from "not at all" to "sort of, in a ramshackle way" -- the peace policy is all to the good.<br/>	Clearly, fighting monsters on the borderlands wasn't a major mission of the royal army if freelance adventurers were doing it: While they may regret the loss of an enemy to justify their existence, they're more likely to view ork-hunting as a tedious distraction from "real wars" against the standing armies of other kingdoms (viz. the US Army's attitude towards counter-insurgency). If the new policy opens a new source of mercenaries, all to the better: Once you've tried to weld peasant conscripts and haughty nobles into a working army, orks look positively tractable. If the army has any misgivings about the new policy, it would be because its officers are largely drawn from the traditional nobility (see above) and share its values.<br/>	The civil bureaucracy -- which at this stage in history means tax-collection -- is going to be unambivalently positive about peace, because they not only get their tax revenues from the merchant class, they are likely to recruit their membership from it as well. There is one possible exception, however, and it's a big one: The highest civilian officials in the kingdom - chancellors, chamberlains, regional viceroys -- are almost certainly high-ranking nobles, and while they are likely to identify with their royal master (and source of power), some may remain sympathetic to the class from which they come and share its antipathy for the peace policy.                        </div>

                            [continued]<br/><br/>Elves: Strong negative<br/>	The Elves had a good deal going with the nobility: Every adventuring party wanted elvish magic and enchanted weapons to help kill monsters, bad-ass long-eared longbowmen could always find employment, and humans looked up to the elves as ancient guardians of all that was good against the encroaching darkness. But Arwen's dead, baby, and while the elves live too long and remember too much to make peace with the monsters, apparently the humans don't. And now that monster territory is off-limits to be conquered, cleared, and colonized, those vast tracts of forest the elves have guarded jealously for centuries look awfully tempting to every peasant with too many kids to feed and a sharp axe.<br/><br/>Dwarves: Weak positive<br/>	Dwarves hate monsters as much as elves do. Dwarves love gold more. And their whole economy is intensive, not extensive: Instead of vast forests sprawling over the land, they just dig deeper and deeper, and produce more and more axes, swords, coats of mail, magic rings, drinking cups, paperweights, etc. ad nauseam. What dwarves need isn't new lands to conquer, it's new markets to sell to, and if the monsters can pay in gold -- well, maybe we'll just forget that page in the Book of Grudges and call it a deal.                        </div>

                            Okay:<br/><br/>How about The Church(es)?  Not the martial orders (the Clerics) we already know about them... I mean the hierarchy itself.<br/><br/>This PROBABLY depends somewhat on theology; a church that has preached the extermination of the soulless evil humanoids is probably not going to have the same reaction as one that preaches universal salvation and the conversion of all.<br/><br/>Also, the criminal underclass (Thieves) is probably worth mentioning.<br/><br/>My thought is that fatter merchants mean fatter thieves, so they'd be behind the idea wholeheartedly... that is, unless fatter merchants have the money for better security, in which case maybe not.  And if the underclass has been smuggling contraband to and from the humanoids for years, they may find the whole thing quite problematic.<br/><br/>Hold on... I just had an idea.<br/><br/>Doesn't FATE have rules for writing up organizations as characters?  This sounds like a great setting for that kind of play.<br/><br/><br/>Also, this setting needs a strong infusion of "They're not Evil, just Misunderstood" going through it... even if it's not true.<br/><br/>In order to maintain the drama, I think the monsters need to be on the losing side of the war, in a big way.  Maybe one race has been completely wiped out, destroyed in an act of genocide on the part of an adventurer group?  Bugbears, maybe.  (Sorry, Buglurz)                        </div>

                            Sydney, that's some impressive analysis.  Thanks!<br/><br/>Vax, one of my touchstones in coming up with the idea is lacing a "They're not Evil, just Misunderstood" vibe through the whole game, but make it very, very questionable.  But then, my bread and butter is ambiguity. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>To my mind, the game would run off of a situation-creation procedure that turned out <em>really</em> complicated and slightly ridiculous sociopolitical gordian knots.  So the end product of that procedure, and the scenario that the PCs would be confronted with, would look something like: The ruined stronghold of Tara Donn has always hosted monsters of various stripes.  The three primary factions are the Blackgut orc tribe, who occupy the bulk of the castle, the "lich king" Ryan and his merry band of undead, who occupy the two north towers, and a swarm of ratkin who have taken over the dungeons.  The Blackgut chieftain Smasher has an <em>understanding</em> with Ryan under which the numerically superior orcs allow the undead their space and the lich does the occasional sorcerous favor for the tribe.  The orcs consider the ratkin little more than vermin, but don't want the dungeons enough to take a very active stance toward them.  Ryan makes a habit of sacrificing ratkin, cause they're easier to come by than the humans in the town below.  In the valley below the castle is the town of Brinkirk, which has lived with the looming presence of Tara Donn since the town's founding.  The town is walled, since the landless orcs often raid for food, and the town's young men often prove their valor and masculinity by taking orc heads as trophies.  Brinkirk's mayor is a nebbish guy under the sway of the town's charismatic praetor Julian, who preaches hatred and disgust of the orcs and the lich that they serve.  Julian is an old man, but he is the son of Ryan the lich, and has daddy issues.  The citizens of Brinkirk have extensive land claims throughout the valley, but due to orc raids, they have never been able to cultivate more than a fraction of it.<br/><br/>So this is your job as PCs: inform the denizens of Tara Donn that they are now full citizens of the realm, extend them the friendship of the king, and figure out a way so that the monsters and the humans stop killing each other.  Go.                        </div>

                            From the "monster" side of the house, the analysis is a lot trickier, but I think there are a few key factors that cut across species:<br/><br/>Solitary vs. Social: Monsters that are already used to living in complex social groupings -- say, Ork tribes, or Hobgoblin-Goblin alliances under an Evil Sorcerer (tm) -- are going to have a head start at understanding how to incorporate into a human society over monsters that live in small bands or alone -- like dragons.<br/><br/>Something to trade?: Monsters that have something to trade will do better than monsters that don't; monsters that have something to trade that can't be taken away from them will do best of all. A dragon with a hoard of treasure in its lair and a library's worth of magical secrets in its brain is going to do pretty well -- until it starts running out of treasure and out of secrets the humans haven't already heard. A goblin tribe that's sitting on prime farmland is going to get "resettled" fast. An ork tribe that can offer hardcore soldiers for the Royal Army, imbued with a ferocity and savagery no human mercenary can match, is going to have something to offer generation after generation.<br/><br/>Intensive vs. extensive lifestyle: Monsters that require vast hunting areas -- dragons, again -- are going to be depriving human settlers of more farmland than monsters with a small ecological "footprint": Ratkin who can live in the sewers of a thriving human city, orks living in caves where no human would want to settle anyway and selling their labor as mercenaries in return for food, tools, and luxury goods.                        </div>

                            See, I think it loses something if you play it for laughs, with the king as the naive idealist. That's an obvious way to run it, but you can say some very powerful things, both good and damning, about liberalism, imperialism, and prejudice here.<br/>

Mostly, though, I like how it demonizes adventurer-types as sowers of dischord. It gives a big F-U to the anti-social assumptions of standard fantasy.<br/>

                            Thanks!<br/><br/>On tone:<br/><br/>The most important thing I've learned about human beings, ever, no contest -- learned from reading history, from being a reporter, from roleplaying, from my own life -- is that <b>people are paradoxical</b>. Nobody is good or evil all the time. In fact, when people do good things, they almost never have 100% pure good motives, and when they do evil things, they almost never have 100% pure evil motives.<br/><br/>Mohammed Atta piloted his plane into the World Trade Center out of displaced anger at his unloving father, a desperate desire to belong after feeling uprooted while studying in European schools, and a sincere belief that he was working to free his fellow Muslims from American oppression. Martin Luther King Jr. was almost certainly an adulterer -- which is a very common trait among charismatic leaders (e.g. Clinton, Kennedy) and probably indicates a mixture of sheer boyish desire for attention alongside the idealism that puts them out in front of the crusade. The camp commandant at Auschwitz-Birkenau loved his wife and kids, who lived in a pretty little cottage that the dying inmates could see through the wire. Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.<br/><br/>One of the easiest traps for independent thinkers is to say, "This person/group/cause has been made out to be the good guys -- but look at these bad things they did! They must be bad!" A common corrollary is "And that means the other side must be good!", which is how you get Vietnam War-era peace protesters chanting "Ho Chi Minh is gonna win," blithely oblivious of the fact that "Uncle Ho" tended to people like them in prison camps.<br/><br/>A "Subterranean Diplomatic Corps" game would be pretty lame if it got boiled down to, "Look! The adventurers are all bad, and the monsters are all good!" It would also be lame if it got boiled down to, "The adventurers are all bad -- and the monsters are all bad too! So anyone who tries to make peace is a naive idealist!" The real story potential likes in the complexities, the paradoxes.                        </div>

But hey, Andrew, that's exactly the kind of religious stereotype we're trying to counter. Maybe they're victims of our anti-Evil ideas, you know? Let's go talk to them, Andrew. What do you say?

                            Here's an interesting little conflict...<br/><br/>What happens when adventurers (who are, frankly, the only ones competent to protect the diplomats) team up with the monsters to preserve their respective ways of life?<br/><br/>You know what would be REALLY cool?<br/><br/>Make it so that you can use DnD dungeon modules to play this game.                        </div>

                            Now, now, JBR... nobody's going to be extending the olive branch to the gelatanous cubes. They're not even sentient!<br/>
<br/>
No, I think they'd be more like a protected animal species. Maybe the king would declare hunting seasons for barely-intelligent monsters, and the rest of the time they're off limits. And so you've have gelatanous cube management, making sure the cubes got fed so there would be a good, revenue producing season in the local dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Temple of Elemental Evil, maybe they're just the Temple of Elemental Angry. Generations ago they went door-to-door to spead the gospel of the elemental lords, and became bitter about having doors slammed in their faces. Maybe if they just had a chance to talk about it and get it off their chests...<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham Walmsley</cite></blockquote>But hey, Andrew, that's exactly the kind of religious stereotype we're trying to counter. Maybe they're victims of our anti-Evil ideas, you know? Let's go talk to them, Andrew. What do you say? Let's break down the barriers of hate with good diplomatic skills (backed by military supremacy if the assholes get nasty like last time).<br/><br/>So you're trying to tell me that's all anti-Elemental propaganda, put about to justify raiding their temple for religious paraphernalia and treasures?                        </div>

                            Another random adventure idea, possibly for an introductory sort of adventure:<br/><br/>Prisoner exchange.  Right from getting the royal writ, to convincing the humans to turn over their prisoners to the players' custody, to escorting them to whatever neutral ground they can arrange, to the actual transfer itself, and then escorting the liberated humans back out.  One or both of the transactions might end up being more like a slave purchase, which could carry its own complications.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>
