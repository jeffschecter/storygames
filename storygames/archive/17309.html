Please go to the website for details.<br/><br/><a href="Ingenero website" rel="nofollow">http://ingenero.wordpress.com/</a><br/><br/><i>Did you ever want to play a RPG that supports the kind of action and drama you see in a HBO TV show like Deadwood or Game of Thrones?  Then this game is for you!</i><br/><br/><b>Ingenero system design principles:</b><br/>These five principles guide the design of the system.  <br/><br/><b>1) Improvisation:</b>  Ingenero scenarios are designed around an intriguing initial situation and a cast of great characters \u2014 both PCs and NPCs \u2014 and everybody improvises play from that point, including the GM.  So the GM is just another player with a cast of characters to play.  There is no preconceived plot to stick to.<br/><br/><b>2) Character-driven focus and pacing:</b>  During play, the things that should be focussed on and examined are the things that matter to the characters \u2013 their aims and goals.  In fact the system has two alternating phases of play specifically to deal with events that are highly relevant to characters goals and those that aren\u2019t.  Which of course means that the players dictate the pace and focus of the game through their choice of character goals.<br/><br/><b>3) Internal goals are just as important as external goals:</b>  An external goal is when a character wants to make something external to himself happen \u2013 win a fight, rob a bank, kiss a girl, etc\u2026  Internal goals are those that satisfy something within the character \u2014 generally giving the character some sense of emotional satisfaction such as gaining admiration, feeding an ego, asserting their status over someone else, etc\u2026  Ingenero treats these goals of equal importance during play.  Another way to say it is \u2014 whats going on in a characters head is just as important as what the character does.<br/><br/><b>4)  Fictional positioning is key:</b>  During action challenges, fictional positioning and risk-taking are the main paths to success.  Fictional positioning means finding a way to get your character into an advantageous position and then capitalising on it.  Such as gaining the high ground, providing covering fire, knocking an opponent off balance, etc\u2026  Ingenero also allows characters to increase their effectiveness if they put themselves in increased physical or mental danger, such as stepping out of cover to get a better shot, or staking your last hope on a decisive action.  Combined, these tactics encourage colourful and dramatic action sequences.<br/><br/><b>5) Emotional manipulation is key: </b> During social challenges, social skills affect perception and emotion, but they don\u2019t dictate outcomes.  Players always retain control of how their characters respond to those emotions or perceptions.  If one character makes another afraid, for example, the other players character decides how to respond to that fear.  It might be to try to hide it, or run away, or retaliate.  The same for any emotion, shame, greed, happy \u2013 whatever.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
