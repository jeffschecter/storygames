In other words, "What do you do?" and "What happens?"  This is, of course, necessary, but it omits an issue that's pretty important to me when it comes to having fun at the table, namely, "How do we experience that?"  If you choose and act and suffer in a boring way, I will not be thrilled.  "So don't play with boring people," is a common reply, but I feel I could just as easily say, "Don't play with poor deciders and clueless GMs," to people who design rules for choices and outcomes.  To me, it's the same thing -- most people who want to roleplay already have some ability to do everything roleplaying requires on their own, and games are there to help them do parts of it better.  Just as Dogs in the Vineyard may produce more dramatic situations, meatier choices, and impactful outcomes, I'd love to play a game which produces more dramatic character-acting, meatier scene description, and impactful verbal pacing.<br/><br/>Puppetland and Swords Without Master put the spotlight on the talking in interesting ways -- both <i>give you a chance</i> to shine with your performance, but I don't think they particularly <i>lead you</i> to shine if you weren't inclined to already.<br/><br/>I bet various LARPs have good tools for this, but I haven't seen much luck porting LARP techniques to tabletop as is.<br/><br/>So, the first thing that comes to mind is using the bribe of Character Success.  It's a technique that I'm pretty tired of -- giving the player a bonus to some character action they want to succeed at, in exchange for buying trouble or tying in a belief or saying how it impacts their lover, or whatever it is the game values.  I'm tired of it, but it works, and most folks seem to accept it, so hey, if it could get me what I want, I'll use it.<br/><br/>So here's my question:<br/><br/><b>If your arch-enemy is about to press the button, and I give you a +1 to your big dramatic sword swing for each of the following, which of them would you actually do without hating them?</b><br/><br/>- show (don't tell) how this is important to your character<br/>- narrate a brief cutaway to a prior moment that adds meaning to the current action<br/>- help us visualize how your sword swing looks<br/>- help us hear your character's voice<br/>- warp time -- either speed up or slow down from the current pace<br/>- frame a shot -- of the established elements in the scene, tell us which are foreground, which are background, what angle do we see them from, etc.<br/>- repeat a motif -- describe an object or action in such a way that that same thing has been described before<br/>- dynamic volume -- go loud or quiet to heighten the mood<br/>- request any of the above from the GM or another player, and then incorporate it into your own narration<br/><br/>Feel free to add things to the list if you think of them!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433359/#Comment_433359" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T05:00:57+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  5:00AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wouldn't this mostly depend on whether I wanted to particularly succeed in the first place?

When in fortune-in-the-middle systems, where you did the description after the roll, how people added "with teeth" to their system design because the description didn't do anything for the mechanics. If you wanted to hit someone, you could either describe how you shoot the opponent in the face or throwing that person to the moon. Neither option mattered because the result - to kill someone - was already established.<br/><br/>My solution to that is to make the description be a bridge between the mechanics and the result in the game world. Where, if you only are using game mechanics, you wont understand what happens. You roll, but for what? You use a banana to open the door. Great, but how? We already know what the result is, but not how it's executed. This is the trouble with systems that describe too much. Using the skill Guns to kill someone, that's self-explanatory. Using Compassion to kill someone, that's trickier to understand.<br/><br/>The game system can also have requirements of using bonuses. In my published game, the players could gain extra bonus to involve several skills (and not only their own), but they had to explain how. Having Pub Knowledge gave a nice tone to a character, who used it to fight people, seek out information or anything by attending bars. Further more, to be able to use points for re-roll, the player had to include something in the environment. A re-rolled Pursuade roll turned into a threat when the player used a point and described it as threatening the secretary to silence by taking the stationary phone on the desk and threaten to hit her with it.<br/><br/>That's the trouble with almost all the things on your list, except repeating the motif. The system doesn't help the player in any way in what to include in the description. "Make a good description" is not a good pointer. "Make something explode" is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433368/#Comment_433368" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T08:57:19+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  8:57AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, you only need to stablish a few techniques on the social contract. It's nothing new, the first ones are from <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/archipelago-ii/" rel="nofollow">Archipielago</a><br/><br/>Whenever a player chooses, acts or suffers in a boring way, use any of these as a GM, trough questions to the player:<br/>-Try a different way: You swing your sword at him? But he's got his shield up, how do you attack him?<br/>-Describe that in detail: You swing your sword at him again? Ok, how exactly do you do it?<br/>-That might not be quite so easy: Again with the sword? Ok, you've done the same attack three times on a roll, this time he's prepared, you'll get a -2. Are you sure?<br/>-A (follow-up/flashback) scene please: Why do you keep swinging your sword like this at him? It's something personal? Ok, let's go back two days, you cross this guy in a bar, what did he said or do that offended you so much?<br/><br/>Award them a Hero Point if they get a nice scene, but only offer it AFTER they narrate it; don't offer it before or include as a hard-coded mechanic (as in "anytime I do this I'll receive a Hero Point") because then players will start to game the system and ruin the fun; even if they narrate a bit more you'll feel it's because of the reward instead of being for the sake of the game, and you will hate it. All this from actual experience: I tried using a FATE-like mechanic for a game and players started to game the system and make it an internal joke. Later the same group played Pathfinder and we were getting hero points every session, but actually enjoying making things interesting instead of doing it for the reward. Later we would invest those hero points again into making scenes more interesting.<br/><br/>Which takes me to further to: Why Hero Points and not a mechanical reward on the spot? Because the latter takes players into pushing the button and exagerate every scene because of it, instead of looking for good occasions to take things to another level by investing hero points. Most of the times those ocassions will be epic final battles about things that actually matter to the players. Otherwise you will have players taking it (probably joking, mostly) to the point of narrating how his character goes to the bathroom in an epical way just to get a +2 to whatever they do there, in a worst case scenario.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433375/#Comment_433375" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T10:27:12+00:00" title="June  4, 2014 10:27AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have trouble answering your question directly - it's very circumstantial, after all, whether I would enjoy "warping time" in a given narration or not.<br/><br/>But I'll say this:<br/><br/>I think rewards for detailed narration are only really interesting to me if they correspond with some other thing. Just getting a bennie for a detailed description can easily lead to:\n<blockquote>[...] in practice it slowed things down.  We all spent excess time and held up the action trying to weave a grand tapestry out of "I make the tea" or "I punch the mook"; we weren't limited to arch-enemy button-pressing moments, and it turned what should have been a reward for a particularly cool and unique stunt into table stakes and flipping through the thesaurus to remain competitive.</blockquote>\nDavide is on the right track, above: let's gauge the interest level of the players and turn that into narrative focus. In other words, more detailed narration isn't about better odds of success, it's also about narrative weight. (After all, that's often how it works in fiction.)<br/><br/>When you're trying to make that climactic sword blow, you want to maximize your chances of success. So adding description and various detail is interesting because it <i>heightens the moment</i>.<br/><br/>The idea, then, is to design a mechanic which brings those together. Think of a movie where some action happens in slow motion: it never ends in a whiff. It will be a cool, exciting victory, or a dramatic and crushing defeat.<br/><br/>So, using those techniques you're describing shouldn't (only) increase the odds of success, it should also escalate the consequences or increase what's at stake. <br/><br/>This, then, acts as a natural limiter: I'm not going to add a ton of description to my attempt to get information out of the barkeep, because it's not worth it - and I certainly don't want my character's life to be at stake here.<br/><br/>The mechanical implementation is one which balances risk and reward. Good examples are the Pool (you can roll more dice, increasing your odds of success but also increasing the "cost" of failure with each die) or Danger dice in Danger Patrol. Another good example is escalation in DitV. All of these give you a foot up on the opposition, but at a very clear and distinct cost or danger.<br/><br/>From another angle:<br/><br/>As Rickard says, it's better if the options are grounded in the fiction itself rather than pure player choice. "Heighten the moment" isn't as good or clear as "escalate to Guns" (from DitV), which works all the time, for everyone, because we all know how that happens and why it's significant.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433377/#Comment_433377" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T12:06:20+00:00" title="June  4, 2014 12:06PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2014 2:08PM by Paul88.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> If you choose and act and suffer in a boring way, I will not be thrilled.

My intent with each item (not with the combo; if <i>all</i> were required, that'd be too much) is to provide good narrative <i>delivery</i> prompts, in the same way that good RPGs already provide good narrative <i>content</i> prompts.

That said, I probably wouldn't enjoy them if they were mandated by the system. A lot of these could feel very forced, or repetitive if they were used with regularity ("ANOTHER flashback? Can we just get on with the action, please?"). When I have a clever idea for a cut-scene, I want to work it into play; such a prompt could give me permission to do that, and that's really fun. But when I don't have an idea, I'm not sure "narrate a flashback" is enough of a prompt to inspire me. (I'd have to try it to be sure, however.)<br/><br/>I'm least fond of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%238&amp;Mode=like">#8</a>. It just sounds like it might be awkward in play unless it were *already* highly appropriate, and it would lose its punch entirely if it was preceded by a break in the action, where a player looks over this list and tries to figure out what to do. Changing dynamic volume, in my opinion, has a lot to do with timing - hesitating would often spoil the effect altogether.<br/><br/>In short, I think all of these make <b>great reminders/permissions</b>, particularly in a game. Beyond that, I'm less sure whether they would useful. I'd have to play with them to be sure, but my gut sense is that they would only help in situations where a) I already had an idea for this kind of thing anyway, and b) it's highly appropriate to the moment, genre, or style of play.<br/><br/>I definitely like the general idea of this thread - this is a great question to be asking!<br/><br/>I would start by looking at how some games already do this (in my post above). TSoY's Bring Down the Pain is another interesting example, somewhat similar to a "slow motion" effect, or at least an increasingly detailed narration of a conflict. These examples from other games are cool, though, in the way that they elicit this behaviour but don't directly reference or enforce it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433398/#Comment_433398" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T20:45:44+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  8:45PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2014 9:01PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, perhaps the combination of action and direction is part of the whole challenge of play.

If that's what you meant, 1,3 and 4 are the same as the second Archipielago technique listed. All you have to do to get this from the players is, after they state their action (if they do it in a boring way)<i> ask them how exactly they do that, or exactly what do they say in character</i>. It feels natural, doesn't interrupt the game or anything. We use this on a regular basis.<br/><br/>2 &amp;5 make me uncomfortable as a player: Yes, you're giving me control of the creative agenda for a moment and even after a couple sessions I won't be sure what I can use from the setting without making the GM or other players feel uncomfortable. It's the same about the gametime I'll take, not to mention I'd had to be inspired to make a good contribution. On top of that, I'd go too far and give the GM something to pull me through the adventure that could change completely the story I meant to play. For example, a friend playing VtM wanted to play a Tremere interested in recovering an antique item for his boss and go around in a sorta Indiana Jones way about it. But he introduced his ghoul as an NPC shaped as a character he had created for his comic, a girl he's very fond of. The GM then took her hostage as a plot device to keep him running with the rest of the party, which ended up generating some unnatural play. Perhaps that could have been avoided with better communication, but it's kinda hard to foresee all the problems that "playing with each other's toys" may or may not generate.<br/><br/>I could do 6 anytime, but one of my best friends can't. He can't use his spatial imagination even to save his life.<br/><br/>7 is nice, but unless the player is at least a bit into poetry and understands the dramatic trick he's meant to pull by using this, they will be a bit at loss.<br/><br/>8 requires that not only everyone must hear the narrator, she needs to have some way to keep the rest of the players at bay for one moment to perform this trick without making them laugh and ruin it. The GM can pull this from time to time, but players may have a hard time with it unless we're talking about serious people playing a dramatic game and really interested on that feeling. I believe there are only two people in my group that I could play games like that with.<br/><br/>At least 9 sounds like an emergency exit: no, YOU do it!<br/><br/>If you just want to have players do more of the GM work (which mades a lot of sense for me: why should only one person of the table focus on all the creative tasks besides dealing with the system?) don't bribe them into it. Give them freedom to do specific tasks, guide them with questions, dare them to try something under limiting conditions... all of it when it isn't their turn. Asking them to be creative just won't do, even if there's a reward of any kind. It will feel stressfull until they understand exactly what's expected from them and what are the limits of their input, something that is already quite clear if you're on the role of a player or the role of a GM, but not when you feel it's something in the middle.<br/><br/>So yes, you can push players into this until they learn how to face it, but again you could do this way faster if you just ask them specific questions or give them specific tasks. For example, I've seen players use NPCs or monsters beautifully when I handed their specs to them, or even when making them from a couple of hints. Our Pathfinder GM used to ask us what we though was happening and then built the next session from our ideas. Also, I kept building on their input as much as I let them build upon mine so we learned to scalate the action together. Asking for details started to work much better then, because if they told me about how they were swinging their sword in detail, I answered with more detail to make the scene interesting. You can perfectly say: If you give me a good description of how you strike your enemy in a way that he can't counter I'll rule it out as a direct hit without rolling. Try giving the players the chance to do this once in a session and let us know how it went!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433403/#Comment_433403" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T21:56:51+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  9:56PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2014 10:01PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's helpful feedback on the numbered points, guys, thanks!  I hope to come back with a revised list soon.  In the meantime, more is welcome!<br/><br/>As for the "don't tell me how to narrate; folks who want to do it will do it without being told, and folks who don't will resent the requirement" comments...  Well, I think that's true for all the people who wouldn't play.  Just as "don't tell me how to determine who wins or loses or dies in an imaginary fight" describes the attitude of someone who would never try D&amp;D.  I mean, <i>no one person</i> thinks D&amp;D combat is perfect, but <i>many groups</i> agree it's better than working things out freeform on their own.  My aim is to build a similar system -- rather than being perfect for any given player, it'll be a set of incentives and constraints that provide a more satisfying style of narration than just letting the different tastes at the table do whatever the heck they want.  <br/><br/>Just as freeform fantasy combatants before D&amp;D disagreed on who would defeat whom in battle, freeform narrators today disagree on how much of what kind of talking is good.  Faced with rules that say "THIS type of talking is good", people can then say "not for me", "good enough to be worth a shot", or "perfect!" just like they can with D&amp;D's approach to combat.<br/><br/>If I knew how to get there I could give clearer examples.  Right now, I suspect that different triggers ought to invoke different narrative techniques, just as different D&amp;D actions invoke different dice rules or different AW moves invoke different outcome lists.  I'd thought of making these triggers story-based -- e.g. "at a Big Moment, do X" -- but "is this a Big Moment?" is even more at the whim of player judgment calls than "is this Going Aggro?"  So perhaps fictional triggers in a genre-anchored game would be better.  An intrigue story gets most detailed when it's planting seeds of suspicion; an action story gets loud and speeds up when the hero is fighting through an army of mooks; a drama zooms in on minutiae of fingers and faces when one character is struggling with how and whether to tell another how they really feel; horror goes from whispers while on the run to screams when the monster pops out.  Would a horror game that said, "When you whisper, roll to avoid being spotted" be fun?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433404/#Comment_433404" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T22:00:45+00:00" title="June  4, 2014 10:00PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2014 10:01PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Would a horror game that said, "When you whisper, roll to avoid being spotted" be fun?</blockquote>Not <i>trying</i> to be a dick, but if the monster/enemy is within earshot, don't you just do this already?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433405/#Comment_433405" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T22:07:17+00:00" title="June  4, 2014 10:07PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2014 1:46AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Would a horror game that said, "When you whisper, roll to avoid being spotted" be fun?</blockquote>Not <i>trying</i> to be a dick, but if the monster/enemy is within earshot, don't you just do this already?</blockquote>No.  The <i>characters</i> may be assumed to be doing this, but many <i>players</i> don't bother.

You're asking ME to do something special and creative in a very involved way, so why aren't you offering an equally special and creative reward for it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433410/#Comment_433410" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T22:46:15+00:00" title="June  4, 2014 10:46PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2014 10:48PM by Paul_D_L.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that this approach is sort of backwards. The vague situations being discussed here mostly revolve around games that already hinge on decisions at their core. Rather than trying to incentivize players to deliver colorful narration and play acting in a game about decisions, you should explore how you make colorful narration into a core part of the game in the first place.<br/><br/>Without other requirements about the design, making it part word game in the first place is an obvious way to go. Just dealing out hands of cards with adjectives on them that must accompany any piece of narration or action is a fine option. That's less about requiring <i>good</i> narration and more about requiring players to be more active in narration, which is probably the best you can hope for in many cases. But that's just an easy, generic option that's the tip of the iceberg.<br/>Some people might excessively joke around with or be embarrassed by a core game mechanic that requires speaking in rhyming couplets to woo a romantic interest and taunt the competition - that's going to depend on your group.<br/>Maybe a fundamental part of your game is that the apparently-definitive history text of the world is fluid or in some way incorrect; and the game includes both writing parts of that text before/during play and then, at appropriate times, cleverly changing some of the words to accomplish what you want and, ultimately, changing what you narrate. That could be a much more concrete way to ensure creation of and rewards for a motif, for example.<br/><br/>I think once you go whole hog with games that are fundamentally <i>about</i> narration, you'll better learn what tools are required to achieve what you seek for a given group or other game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerulean" title="nerulean"><img alt="nerulean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerulean">nerulean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433413/#Comment_433413" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T00:46:00+00:00" title="June  5, 2014 12:46AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My old D&amp;D group packed with power players and dull narrators turned into pretty cool storytellers when I ran Always/Never/Now for them. It uses the Lady Blackbird system, so they couldn't do anything effectively unless they gave a narration that hit at least five or six keywords on their sheet, and they only gained XP when they did something appropriate or meaningful for their character, but because it was baked into the system they got on board with it quickly. By contrast, when I played what was functionally a dungeon delve board game that gave rewards if you "described something in a cool way", it just felt awkward and out of place. I knew I <i>could</i> describe things at the level the game wanted, but the game was so tactical that it broke the flow to suddenly launch into a description of a wire fu bullet time sequence rather than just passing turn and letting the next person make their move.<br/><br/>One thing you could do is have a couple of sample questions that have a meaningful in-game trigger, so whenever someone rolls a mega success, or uses a rare in-game resource, or identifies their current opponent as their nemesis, etc., the GM or someone else round the table can choose to ask the player a question that would prompt one of the behaviours in your list above.

Pass-the-stick mechanics like that are very hit and miss to me, but that particular idea would definitely get people comfortable with different types of narration - or even train them to do it. I suspect a particularly satisfying part of that game would be learning pacing. Did people grin with anticipation when Unexpectedly Lighthearted grabbed the mic, or did it deflate tension in a way that was just frustrating before they even spoke? And another good part would be how much you have to listen in order to really get anything out of it. Some players get invested as silent audience members, but in my experience, players who listen most intently tend to be ones who contribute well.<br/><br/>As for games that are, at their core, about narration (or performance), Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple comes to mind. I think InSpectres interviews tap into that, too. I'm sure there are many obvious ones that other folks here will recall. Hell, my Game Chef entry this year revolves entirely around stunted, tech-support-like phone conversations with adventurers stuck mid-quest, calling a service for advice. The attempt is to create a comedy duo - I didn't even bother with action/scene resolution. So I'm definitely interested in games that work on the axis of verbal interaction instead of just conflict generation and resolution through character actions; and I hope people can name some with which I'm unfamiliar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433416/#Comment_433416" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T03:02:56+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  3:02AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2014 3:05AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/archipelago-iii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a> got domains, controlled by different participants.

Games that focus on narrative are not the same thing as games that are 'about narration' or 'about the delivery'. Fiasco is generally a game about what happens, not about how what happens is described. Its mechanics are all about creating great situations and resolving outcomes of scenes, not about delivering awesome dialogue or describing compelling physical action. The same goes for Shock:.<br/><br/>Penny For My Thoughts is a very interesting example, though, because it does actually constrain -- and therefore bring focus to -- specific narrative tools, and therefore specific ways of describing what is happening. By removing the player's most obvious tool to expressing their character -- the ability to describe what their character actually does and says -- it forces players to explore other modes of expression and description. Players in Penny are far more likely to describe their characters' thought and feelings directly, and they are also more likely to show who their character is through how they see the world: the game rigorously promotes a first-person point of view which is very unusual in roleplaying games. Not in terms of how the players <i>think about their character</i> -- I think it's fairly common to try and look at what is going on through your character's eyes, etc. -- but in terms of <i>actually describing what is happening</i>. <br/><br/>Almost all action/setting/event narration in rpgs is in the third person*, but the third person is not accessible to characters/players in Penny. The only way they can say what is happening is by describing their own memories of what happened. This opens up the possibility of the players using that device expressively, instead of descriptively. The game doesn't directly encourage it, but it tends to indirectly encourage it simply by forcing the player further and further into their characters' head, so that eventually it starts to happen automatically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Or is described using objective language, even when presented from the position of the character. 'I run him through with my sword' is first-person narration in a technical sense, at best.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433424/#Comment_433424" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T07:31:38+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  7:31AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>This seems like the crux to me.

Not so much "confusion" as "throwing the net wide".  Certain types of players can get narrative brilliance and awesome delivery out of really crunchy simulationist systems, so I listed some uncrunchy narrativist systems.  You're not wrong.  But like I said, YMMV.<br/><br/>If we're talking about strictly "reward for awesome delivery" that's obviously going to be a human value judgment that differs from table to table.  There are games that say "you get bonus XP for telling the tale well" or even "if no one objects, you get a lawyer point" - but of course that's totally subjective.  At that level of conceptualization, a mechanic might cover voting methods, counting methods, consensus methods, etc, but could not handle a direct evaluation of delivery "quality".<br/><br/>One pseudo-qualitative rule I've seen in at least two games: "get a bonus if you make the GM (or the other players) laugh."  But that doesn't work across all genres.  In a horror game you might even feel a desire to <i>penalize</i> someone for breaking the mood that way.<br/><br/>ETA: Which leads me to this thought: What if we turn the OP on its head?  Instead of asking "Can you bribe for better narration?" perhaps some fresh ideas would arise if we asked a different question: <b><i>"Can you penalize for poor narration?"</i></b><br/><br/>Note that the word "poor" as I use it above is really shorthand for lots of things.  A sampling might include:<br/>mood-destroying, disruptive, discontinuous, stilted, sloppy, boring, out-of-character, off-point, off-genre,  reality-breaking...<br/>...and that list might differ from GM to GM, from game to game, or even from session to session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433429/#Comment_433429" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T08:54:58+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  8:54AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2014 9:02AM by WarriorMonk.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think nerulean nailed it a few posts ago:\n<blockquote>My old D&amp;D group packed with power players and dull narrators turned into pretty cool storytellers when I ran Always/Never/Now for them. It uses the Lady Blackbird system, so they couldn't do anything effectively unless they gave a narration that hit at least five or six keywords on their sheet, and they only gained XP when they did something appropriate or meaningful for their character, but because it was baked into the system they got on board with it quickly. By contrast, when I played what was functionally a dungeon delve board game that gave rewards if you "described something in a cool way", it just felt awkward and out of place. I knew I <i>could</i> describe things at the level the game wanted, but the game was so tactical that it broke the flow to suddenly launch into a description of a wire fu bullet time sequence rather than just passing turn and letting the next person make their move.<br/><br/>One thing you could do is have a couple of sample questions that have a meaningful in-game trigger, so whenever someone rolls a mega success, or uses a rare in-game resource, or identifies their current opponent as their nemesis, etc., the GM or someone else round the table can choose to ask the player a question that would prompt one of the behaviours in your list above. "What does that look like?", "What does my PC/this NPC hear from the room next door?", "What happened to make you hate this guy so much?". </blockquote>\nAnd I was wondering why nobody care until I readed this:\n<blockquote><br/>Almost all action/setting/event narration in rpgs is in the third person<br/></blockquote>\nIs it really true? Because, if it is, I've been playing RPGs in a really fun wrong way my entire life. In all of the groups we've been we do use objective language for the actions, but whenever anybody stated an action that included his/her character speaking or doing something specific, the GM always asked the question "Ok, how exactly do you say it?" which was the prompt for us to start talking in character and gesturing our character's actions instead of just describing them. It's like going into full theatrical mode, which is reinforced by the GM narrating things in more detail to increase the drama, going loud or hushing the narration to best accomodate the moment, and lately by sheer luck, matching the background music we keep playing on the pc while we're gaming.<br/><br/>I agree that the change from hardcore trad players to hardcore trad players who narrate and add detail to their roleplaying requires a different game, one with tools engrained to make that gameplay feel natural among the players. I've been hacking and testing deveral different game mechanics in the last 12 years for this purpose, hacking them from story games and interesting twists on trad games from anywhere.<br/><br/>What I found is that there's a limit for the amount of mechanics that players will engage in any game. Think if for a moment: nobody uses ALL the rules from D&amp;D. Even when it has rules for almost anything, the GMs and players don't engage on the encumbrance mechanics unless PCs going into a town and start loading themselves with equipment, or go into a dungeon and try to pick up every single dime they find. Even then, a lot of GMs just let go of it and allow players to carry a whole arsenal of weapons and a couple chests of treasure with them just because they want to keep going with the story.<br/><br/>Next, I found that players tend to become more creative when they are relaxed, as in not worried about the encumbrance rules or trying to find a loophole to use certain class ability as a setting-breaking tool; or when they don't have to pay attention to every single +1 their equipment, skills, feats, ability mods and circumstancial bonuses they get against a particular enemy. As a GM, the less you have them thinking on the numbers, the more you will have them thinking on the story.<br/><br/>Here's where the narrative mechanics of the game come into play (pun not intended), though again, the less you use, the better. The acknowledgement of the GM or other players to every contribution here is the best reward you can use as a game designer, because any other kind of reward will have them thinking into numbers again. Whenever you reduce a scene into a number, you take away any meaning to it, that's why even if you roleplayed or narrated your best to get that +1 to your next roll, you ended up doing because of that +1 instead of because the story could get more interesting that way. Any acknowledgement that comes after this from anyone is subconsciously identified by the player with the act of gaming the system to get a +1 or more.<br/><br/>That's why bribing the players into this doesn't work. You're calling yourself bribing, because that's what it is and that's what the players will definitely perceive, even if they don't adress at it like that. Collaborative players will certainly go with it as they could go with railroading, but in the end the chances that this develops into an unnatural/unhealty gameplay ar quite high.<br/><br/>The archipielago techniques I mentioned are more or less how I have ended up playing today. But the core thing is all about asking provocative questions to the players. "Exactly how you do X?" has become a provocative question for my group because now they know that if I smile while asking it, it means it's a loaded one. It may mean that the GM has something on store that will be introduced as soon as they do the "wrong move", and that if they do it in a different way it will spoil my plans.<br/><br/>A subtle change on the tone for the same question means "Come on, you've already used that attack on your previous turn and it's boring, try it on a different way"<br/>But in every case, they are rewarded for the result: either they spoil my plan and I let them notice it and/or I build on whatever they said, and/or other players build on their contribution making the scene more interesting. Even surprise interjections from the GM or the group act like a nice reward.<br/><br/>Yet I mentioned Hero Points as a mechanic reward since I've been using them broadly and even found them to be quite perfected in the way a trad game as Pathfinder uses them. There a hero point is used to re-roll the dice on any situation or (as we used them regularly) to ask the GM for things that were out of the mechanics but could make the scene more interesting. I recall once that the GM had a dozen drakes and an army of undead surrounding us. I was playing a monk specialized in grappling so I asked if I could spend all my hero points to jump on the drake and try to use his breath attack against the undead. To my surprise, the GM allowed it because the scene was epic, and while the breath attack only did it's normal damage and didin't finished with the whole army, I enjoyed it and became a memorable moment for everyone.<br/><br/>Another important thing about Hero Points: they are a resource as important as spells. Notice how often magic users save their best spells for later, when they will make a difference? that's because players can read perfectly how serious is a situation (as loong as the GM is clear on the signals) and spend them in the right moment, creating espectacular scenes. It's the same with Hero Points: the players will save them for later and only use in scenes that actually matter, making them more interesting. So there, you have the problem of timing the use of better descriptions and limiting them to the most important scenes. Because, it willonly be on those scenes where they could gain those hero points back.<br/><br/>I understand there's a ton of ways of obtaining this and other kinds of gameplay, so I beg your pardon for insisting too much on these. It's just that I feel you're stumbling on the same point I was a few years ago and that this may save you a few years of investigation. It's possible that I'm assuming too much while still not getting exactly what kind of game experience you want as a GM or what you would like your players to experience, so I'll keep quiet for the moment and just keep watching how this develops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433432/#Comment_433432" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T09:33:49+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  9:33AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post, WM, but I feel a need to raise my hand and represent for the people who can do math without losing meaning or narrative strength, and without becoming minmaxers.

However, it never worked. At most, people would stick with that for a sentence or two, but pretty quickly switch into the present tense. The story was been created in the present moment, after all - speaking about it in the past tense felt strange. (Consider doing it that way in an RPG - "And then my character swung his sword at the Orc..." - it's weird.)<br/><br/>But then one day we played Polaris. We started by reading some of the flavour text, and familiarizing ourselves with the ritual phrases. All in the past tense. And, without even consciously thinking about it, we all started narrating in the past tense, and had no trouble staying there.<br/><br/>As another example, consider how the very act of reaching for and rolling dice creates pauses in narration and punctuates certain actions above others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433450/#Comment_433450" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T14:30:41+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  2:30PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2014 3:02PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: "train people through practice; you can't make someone a better actor through rules" -- I think that misses the point entirely.  <br/><br/>Again, I will compare my intent to D&amp;D combat -- yes, people do get better at D&amp;D combat through practice, and yes, someone who completely lacks the ability to reason through probabilities will never be good at it... but who cares?

And it's not that people take the game's fiction to an absurd, infantile place. It's that <i>everybody</i> is simply being non-serious. I think you can take a game seriously, but be a non-serious person who says non-serious things even during that game. For some people, that wrecks their pace, inhibits their ability for some type of immersion, etc.; but for us, it's how we interact in the first place. So it feels far more ironic and fake for us to flip a switch and be something else.<br/><br/>But then we slip into engaged, focused play. Every once in a rare while, it's a chore to get there, but at least as often, there's a kind of magic in having it naturally sneak up on you that I don't think I've experienced with a group that demands more focus from the outset.<br/><br/>What's rough is when a player isn't being childish, but simply "goes gonzo" all the time. For some people, there is no barrier between ubiquitous non-play goofiness and ridiculous Hollywood logic injected into the game, itself. I experience this more frequently than not during convention games, actually. It's one small reason that I have no special love for rules or agendas that are designed to <i>protect</i> the contributions of individuals above all else. And, on topic, that's a legitimate danger in many games that are about narration simply because the performance/delivery is supposed to be more impacting and final. It's difficult to socially negotiate those acts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nerulean" title="nerulean"><img alt="nerulean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nerulean">nerulean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433459/#Comment_433459" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T15:46:56+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  3:46PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>One thing you could do is have a couple of sample questions that have a meaningful in-game trigger, so whenever someone rolls a mega success, or uses a rare in-game resource, or identifies their current opponent as their nemesis, etc., the GM or someone else round the table can choose to ask the player a question that would prompt one of the behaviours in your list above.

Or having a mechanical way of determining who picks the question, such as the player with the most positive or negative relationship points with the triggering character, the player whose character is being attacked, the player who's next in the initiative order.<br/><br/>It would need to be as quick as possible to determine who's choosing and the question list would need to be short and always to hand, maybe five questions at most. As long as it's part of the rules, it doesn't need to be separately incentivised, it just becomes what happens: if you roll a critical success, you do bonus damage and respond to a question that requires a narrative answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433462/#Comment_433462" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T16:31:29+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  4:31PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2014 4:37PM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The point is to take players who <i>can</i> focus on combat in a certain way but otherwise <i>don't</i>, and provide them a system such that now they <i>do</i>.</blockquote>\nOf course, you can design games however you want, but it seems to me like you take this on from the wrong perspective, where you assume that they don't want to do the task and that you need to bribe them with a reward. I would rather see that you assume that they want to do the task and then guide them into how to do it. Then the fun of doing the task will be to do the task itself, rather than doing it for the reward. If they don't want to do the task, then they should play another game.<br/><br/>I myself can have a hard time not including mechanical rewards in my designs, because that's how roleplaying games usually works.\n<blockquote><blockquote>When you put people on the spot and tell them they have to be creative, often they comply, but what you get is <b>totally fucking silly</b>.</blockquote>Yup.  Been there 1000 times.  In every single case, the "pressure that makes people silly" has been about "you must invent content", not about "you must deliver it thusly".  My idea might actually be a <i>solution</i> to silliness.</blockquote>\nRepeating what <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">@Paul_D_L</a>  said and backing it up with a source too. Keith Johnstone talks in Impro how people start off with silliness before they go into more sexual content and finally steps into a more "serious" mental state. So it's a natural progress, where the silliness to some is a defense mechanism. If a player however, which I thought <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a> talked about, always is silly then it's more about breaking the social contract. Take a step back and redo the whole introduction phase, where you (the game master or the whole group) sets the tone. I noticed that it's important to repeat this introduction phase at the start of every session.<br/><br/>I also think that a harder structure creates more comfort, and comfort is important when it comes to narrating, otherwise their defense mechanism can kick in. Experienced game master usually never have trouble spitting out stuff, but that's because they are using unspoken structures that they learned through the years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433463/#Comment_433463" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T16:35:48+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  4:35PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2014 4:43PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> when you say "a harder structure", I'm reading you to mean "a more rigid structure" - is that correct?<br/>I ask because the word "harder" can also mean "more difficult" (which is <i>not</i> what I think you meant).<br/><br/>PS - About the silly player I really meant "cannot stop talking about farts <i>tonight.</i>"  Maybe tonight the tone is particularly serious, so he gets silly.

Namely, you make the game about doing that thing and bring attention to doing that thing and provide tools to help the players do that thing. These are all complementary and inter-related things.<br/><br/>But I am not entirely sure if this is the level of focus you are interested in; half this thread is people talking about having better description of actions in their D&amp;D games, which as you mention seems like a kind of baseline of not-completely-terrible play (in this specific regard.) To me, the idea of a list of rough incentives that provide bonuses to success fall pretty squarely in this design camp -- they're fine if the game isn't about that thing, and you still want some of it in there, but they're not going to elevate players' contributions (along the for-lack-of-a-better-word aesthetic axis) much by themselves.<br/><br/>Personally I feel like a lot of the games that provide the strongest impetus for this kind of descriptive play do so in part by leading by example; the games themselves are presented with a strong attention to aesthetics, and their premises are evocative in a way that clearly suggests how play will benefit from players following through on those aesthetics. <i>Polaris</i> is probably the strongest example: the game includes a piece of short fiction, and the ritual phrases themselves adopt a specific language that pushes players to focus on their own descriptions. To do otherwise is to constantly introduce basic aesthetic dissonance, and so players naturally adopt a specific aesthetic style when playing the game.<br/><br/>Another game that comes to mind is <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i>, which pushes its wuxia aesthetic in a variety of ways, not least the production of the book itself. Nobody who looks at (let alone reads) the book is going to avoid the inescapable conclusion that this is game you have to play with a conscious attention to aesthetic and descriptive detail. The game itself then follows that up by bringing further attention to the individual aesthetics of the characters, who have strong mechanical associations with specific aesthetic devices (colours, weather patterns, masks, sounds, etc.) This is clearly not a game where you just sort of describe what your character does and then, you know, whatever. The dueling mechanics bring the whole thing home, as players compete on behalf of their characters on both aesthetic and narrative grounds, attempting to convince their fellow-players that they deserve to win the fight. Again, this is one of the very few games that explicitly calls attention to the fact that your audience (which is to say the people you are playing with) are judging your contributions -- and it goes a step further by making those judgements opaque/arbitrary, <i>consequential</i> and private.<br/><br/>And while yes these games may have mechanics that 'reward' players for excellence in description, the core of their success is the complete package of the game; its presentation, themes, and about-ness are all focused in part on an aesthetic quality that it both expects from its players and helps them produce. The reward is the feeling that you are playing the game correctly; the motivation is that the game seems worth playing that way. An extra die to attack with just isn't on the same level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433475/#Comment_433475" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T18:19:19+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  6:19PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Kagematsu is another interesting example of this, I think.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Can you bribe for better narration? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19481/can-you-bribe-for-better-narration/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Can you bribe for better narration? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19481/can-you-bribe-for-better-narration/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Point taken, @AccountingForTaste, they are different questions.

href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">@AccountingForTaste</a>, they are different questions.  Ok, let's look at them both.  Yours ("players reward themselves for good narration") is more democratic and definitely seems more suited to a narrativist approach or situation.  The difficulty would be in adjudication but that could be handled by consensus processes or votes.  Which might break the flow, but at least it's democratic.<br/><br/>Mine ("players penalize the GM for bad narration") ... well firstly, how do you penalize a GM?  You can't, really.  But you can do mechanical things like take away his turn, give a negative mod to one of his NPCs, overwrite one of his adjectives with one of your own choosing, get an extra roll when you feel like it, etc.    So it seems to be more about "probability of player getting their desired outcome" which we might say is a more <i>simulationist</i> approach.  <br/><br/>But note: We can tell in both cases that this is not a simulation of <i>reality,</i> but a simulation of <i>another medium</i> (a book or a movie etc), because the value judgments are concerned with <i>narrative qualia</i>.  We might even imagine a <i>gamist</i> view in which "who controls the plot" is a real mechanical concern, yet still have all our value judgments rooted in <i>narrativist</i> sensibilities. *<br/><br/>[* And yes to <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>, this <i>is</i> a small part of my answer to that question you've been asking me for a while.  More on that later, in your "we know so little" thread.  Keyword: Foucault].<br/><br/>Most of the systems proposed are identical in this regard: They consider the emotional value or narrative qualities of the speaker's or listener's experience, determined subjectively, to be a fungible object in the game's meta-economy.  At that point, an exchange transaction may occur between a subjective value and an objective one.<br/><br/>This is a meaningful point to reach, because from here we can see that any solution in which "someone rewards/punishes someone for good/bad narration" is actually a mechanic of this type.  Going all the way back to those bonus XP for roleplay from the original D&amp;D.  The only categorical questions remaining are about who makes that judgment, who controls that transaction, which direction it flows in, and when.<br/><br/>From here it is clear (at least I think it is) that if the bonuses/penalties are high enough, a mechanic like this stands a chance of "becoming what playing the game is about".  Which may be entirely the designer's point.  Yet it is still a meta-fictional (I almost want to say "metagaming") concern, as well as a playstyle issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433477/#Comment_433477" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T18:31:57+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  6:31PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You often bring up the point that rewarding the very activity we come to play for is counterproductive. This is borne out by a number of recent psychology studies in other fields (education, some financial applications, sports, etc). <br/><br/>However, I have yet to see this effect shown/proven in gameplay. It's funny that your point of view on this sounds quite backwards to many of the people here, since many of us have had very positive experiences with direct rewards in games we've played.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where these two points of view can come to meet, but I'll keep thinking on it.</blockquote>\nThis is directed at Rickard, but I'll weigh in.<br/><br/>There's an important difference between unrelated cookies and rewards that power a cycle in play. Unrelated cookies are frequently mentioned in this thread: a bonus to a roll for describing it in grand terms. The old chestnut of experience points for roleplaying in D&amp;D is not identical, but similar because XP is a pacing mechanic and it's almost always harder on everybody if the party has uneven advancement. You're necessarily going to hit that next level really soon, anyway, it's trivial and unrelated to the act of roleplaying to level sooner. I could go on about that.<br/><br/>Rewards that fuel a game engine are more like getting Checks in Mouse Guard for using Traits against yourself. You make things harder on yourself now in exchange for options later. In this case, making things hard on yourself directly interacts with and actually runs contrary to the explicit goal of the game: finishing your mission and following your belief. So Checks are, among other things, about choosing where to put your locus of control.<br/><br/>Another type of fuel-like reward in a competitive game is points/tricks/goals that determine a winner. There ultimately is no cycle that's being created, you aren't playing for points, you're playing to win - points simply keep track of things.<br/>I'm not sure it's counterproductive to introduce competition to a storytelling game, even if there is no distinct win condition; but I definitely think if that's your intention with certain types of rewards/bennies, it will only be productive if you make that competition explicit. Level up the fastest in D&amp;D by getting experience points for compelling roleplaying is probably not a game I want to play, but if that's the clearly-stated experience you seek, I don't know how that <i>can</i> be counterproductive.<br/><br/>So, as far as I can tell, I'm on board with Rickard to a good degree, but I think it largely comes back to expectations. Using our current discussion, rewards almost certainly won't make you a better narrator. But, if used properly, rewards might help to tell us how well someone fulfilled a system's goals. It's still up to the system to actually generate opportunities to fulfill those goals, which is what's really important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433484/#Comment_433484" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T21:13:35+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  9:13PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> The reward is the feeling that you are playing the game correctly; the motivation is that the game seems worth playing that way.

And actually "harder structure" seems more appropiate if we take in consideration both the "rigid" and a bit of the "more difficult" interpretations. Basically games are some sort of challenge, against one or more players, against a fictional situation, etc. When you give players both a rigid structure and a harder challenge trough it, the game becomes not only more focused on the sort of experiences you want to convey, but also more interesting as a challenge.<br/><br/>So now the thing is what kind of experiences you want your game to convey and how to convey those. For example, penalizing the players for poor narration as actually possible in a fun way: Let's say, whenever a PC receives damage, give the player the opportunity to narrate how their armour, reactions or sheer luck diminishes the damage, with the option that the GM could narrate additional effects if the narration is poor. So, the PC is going to receive damage anyway, but the player narration skills can actually reduce that damage! Most players I know would jump at the chance of narrating in this situation. The worst that can happen is that they take damage anyway.<br/><br/>You can also ask players to narrate how their characters experience the attack from their point of view and take full damage with the option that if the scene looks good, the GM can add some details to help the PC or even re-roll the damage and apply the lower result.<br/><br/>I believe anything can go as long as it becomes a fun challenge where losing doesn't matter and winning just means that you'll <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18733/we-know-so-little-of-our-hobby#Item_138" rel="nofollow">enjoy the fun of learning</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433488/#Comment_433488" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T22:45:10+00:00" title="June  5, 2014 10:45PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2014 11:29PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Point taken, <a href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">@AccountingForTaste</a>, they are different questions.  Ok, let's look at them both.  Yours ("players reward themselves for good narration") is more democratic and definitely seems more suited to a narrativist approach or situation. </blockquote>\nWell....that's not at all what I was thinking about when I wrote that, so I'm not sure you should credit me with it.<br/><br/>What I had in mind was something more along the lines of the scenario described in the original post, where the GM thinks that the dramatic confrontation at the end needs more oomph, and offers a bonus to success as a reward to the player for using various narrative techniques to jazz it up, and my basic feeling that the reward is ill-suited to the task in that case. The GM says to the player, "Do something out of the ordinary and creative! Impress me!", but only offers the incredibly generic "+1 towards success" in exchange.<br/><br/>And that seems lame to me. I want the reward to be commensurate with the task! If I give you something above-and-beyond the usual, why aren't you giving me the same thing?<br/><br/>So then I flipped it around: same setup, only this time the GM isn't offering anything and it's the <i>player</i> who feels that the dramatic confrontation lacks oomph. Why no oomph? Maybe the archenemy is lame and the player never wants to see that character again. Maybe the fight has dragged on too long and the player just wants it to be over so that they can get to the interesting part. Maybe the player just feels like having a better chance at success than normal. Why <i>not</i> award yourself a bonus, without consultation or arbitration, on the grounds that the situation as described by the GM isn't very interesting and should end sooner rather than later, and in the direction you find most interesting? (After all, plenty of games let characters decide to give in and lose a conflict without requiring anyone else to approve of it...why should something as paltry as a +1 bonus be treated as more significant than that?)<br/><br/>Maybe it could be formalized -- "Hey, GM, this bandit holding us up...why would this particular bandit be especially important to my character? No reason? Fine, then I'm taking a bonus to hit him, because I think we've gotten all the interesting stuff we can possibly get out of random bandit holdups and I'd like to get to the next scene faster." If the GM can't think of a way to make the situation more engaging and the player can't think of a way to make it more engaging, either, isn't it better for everyone to stack on some bonuses and end it fast? I dunno. Just a random thought about the weirder edges of the original example, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433492/#Comment_433492" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T03:29:58+00:00" title="June  6, 2014  3:29AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2014 4:41AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, this thing exploded while I slept. xD\n<blockquote>Namely, you make the game about doing that thing and bring attention to doing that thing and provide tools to help the players do that thing.

I first want to say this:\n<blockquote>And while yes these games may have mechanics that 'reward' players for excellence in description, the core of their success is the complete package of the game; its presentation, themes, and about-ness are all focused in part on an aesthetic quality that it both expects from its players and helps them produce.

I believe <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autotelic" rel="nofollow">autotelic</a> design is the way to go just like it's explained above.\n<blockquote>This.

I would like to add the old clich\xe9 to what you wrote: limitations (in this case, through a rigid structure) feeds creativity.\n<blockquote>Instead of asking "Can you bribe for better narration?" perhaps some fresh ideas would arise if we asked a different question: "Can you penalize for poor narration?"</blockquote>\nI'm not addressing you personally now but people in this thread generally. Because reward/bonus and penalty are the same things. If one person gets three +1 tokens, it's the same thing as the other person getting three -1 tokens. It's just that "rewards" sounds better. Both are however corrections, and it will mechanically result the same thing\u2014one player's mechanical advantage over another. How it affects mentally depends. If one player have chosen to give penalty to itself, by using the system, then it's OK to have three more tokens. If someone else instead would have given that player it's tokens, it can turn into favoritism. Someone can try to rationalize that away, but try to think about it for a second first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433493/#Comment_433493" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T04:19:06+00:00" title="June  6, 2014  4:19AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2014 9:49AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">@Paul_D_L</a> and <a href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">@IceCreamEmperor</a> said it all.

Give them candy for doing Math and other subjects, because then the tasks will be fun. Now, this is an unfair comparison because you're point is, as I have understood it, is to make people discover new ways of playing. I remember talking to a friend of mine and how he described how his group, when playing a certain roleplaying game, started to narrate when they got points to spend for describing things outside what their character could do.<br/><br/>But here's the thing. Did they start to narrate because of the points or is it something else behind it? From how I see it, what they got was actually a mechanic that <i>allowed</i> them to describe things in the surroundings or to narrate how cool they are while taking out mooks. And what does structure bring? Comfort in executing it. The players got the confidence to narrate because the game's structure told them to. Here's another example of what I talk about. I love Ludo. It's my go to game every day and if I would to see Ludo in a room full of games, I would choose Ludo. Getting a cookie for playing Chess would make me pay attention to Chess, but do you think it will motivate me to play Chess?<br/><br/>How I would like to design games is to make the game to be about something, like getting outside the room, but to be able to get outside the room, I first need to play Chess. Do you see how I managed to create a game through the use of Chess without having to use a reward? The reward is instead a combination of the goal of the game, and doing the task to achieve that goal. "But what if you don't like to play Chess?", someone may ask. Then I shouldn't play the game at all. Obviously, this is a game for people enjoying doing that task in the first place.\n<blockquote>You often bring up the point that rewarding the very activity we come to play for is counterproductive. This is borne out by a number of recent psychology studies in other fields (education, some financial applications, sports, etc).</blockquote>\nI remember so well what Mark "Magic the Gathering" Rosewater wrote <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/89" rel="nofollow">in two</a> of <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr28" rel="nofollow">his articles</a>, and it has stayed with me ever since I read them. What he did was basically compare basic design ideas for electronic products and for art with game design. In how you can benefit as a game designer to read, for example, about architecture. You can benefit from it because they all follow the same psychology for humans.<br/><br/>Don't you think the same thing applies to games? How behavior patterns that I can find in marketing or sport have the same psychology behind it as in games? The thing is, what I bring up isn't that new. The controversial over-justification effect happened 1971 and the first book about flow came out 1975. It's not until <i>recent years</i> that people like Raph Koster, Nicole Lazzaro and Jane McGonigal has brought this over to games too. About how they discovered that play is the basic pattern for learning new things. About what playing does to our brain, in how it releases dopamins that creates an intrinsic reward for doing the task. You feel good, when doing the task you want to do, thanks to dopamins. These people, and many more, have also sprung ideas in how to design games to achieve this effect. Koster with his (and Daniel Cook's) skill atom that constantly loops back, Lazzaro with her four keys of fun that she loops through during play, and McGonigal that ... is just weird ... but I love her ideas about how games can be used to create a more positive take on life. She even designed a game that helped her getting through the effects of a head trauma\u2014effects that basically made her suicidal.<br/><br/>So it's not just me not liking extrinsic rewards. It's me not liking how rewards in roleplaying games are handled and thought of. And if we can't learn from other sources than (roleplaying) games, that will most certainly create an inbred design culture. "But it works in other games". Yeah, but why does it work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433495/#Comment_433495" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T04:47:10+00:00" title="June  6, 2014  4:47AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we should all move beyond the bribery bit at this point.  It's a distraction from the more interesting discussion of narration.  I led off with it because bribery is proven to work in most popular RPGs, not because I like it.  Most of y'all don't like it either, and have chimed in with plenty of better ideas, so let's stick to those better ideas.<br/><br/>As for <i>how central narration is to the game</i>, I think we have plenty of options.  A game <i>could</i> be "all about narration", but I'm positive that it doesn't <i>have</i> to be, as evidenced by the fact that most RPG groups greatly enjoy some part of their gaming that is neither central nor necessary by definition.  Acting out my characters was a big part of why I played D&amp;D, even though it wasn't <i>the</i> reason I played D&amp;D and it wasn't integrated into other game activities like combat.  <br/><br/>I'm happy to discuss games that are all about narration!  I suspect that's a good way forward.  But I don't accept that as a hard requirement.  My inspiration runs more in the direction of "play which benefits greatly from good narration", e.g. a supernatural suspense game with an emphasis on dread.  Hopefully if you get group buy-in to the mood, narrative features which enhance that mood (or at least provide a unique version of it) will be accepted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433496/#Comment_433496" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T04:52:10+00:00" title="June  6, 2014  4:52AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2014 4:53AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniel, you've said a bunch of interesting stuff that I'd like to respond to, but I have to ask before I forget, did you see <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/433452#Comment_433452" rel="nofollow">my question</a> about your game?

For instance, your example of playing chess in order to go outside is exactly the way good reward systems work in RPGs, at least for my tastes. No one plays the Shadow of Yesterday in order to score the most XPs possible... and yet chances are pretty good that if no one's scoring any XPs, the game is less fun or not going as well as it could.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm looking forward to reading through your links but otherwise will keep this sub-topic out of Dave's thread!

I'm trying to figure out a few things. Feel free to skip down to Eero's next post; he's probably got it figured out by now ; )<br/><br/>  So, let's try it from a different angle. If you make a game about numbers, you provide the numbers. If you make a game about words, maybe you should provide the words.<br/>How many of us speak well, readily and wittily? How often do we use \u201cuhm\u201d, \u201clike\u201d, \u201cyou know\u201d,etc? How often have we sat through someone's achingly bad (but heart-felt) role playing? Even pro improv actors stumble now and again.<br/><br/>  The Dying Earth RPG. One of it's draws was the language Vance used, especially the Cugel stories. It's kind of a strange mix of Shakespeare and Groucho Marx. Several examples are provided and players are encouraged to adopt the form. But how? Vance was a professional writer and even he had to sit down and think about it. It seems foolish to memorize all the quotes. Also note that the language was largely in the dialogue. When Cugel hides behind a rock, we are told that he hides behind a rock (Hide check). But what Cugel <i>says </i>is :<br/>  \u201cI lament that your knowledge of advanced military strategy is on par with your personal hygiene. Clearly, I am gaining tactical advantage from a retreating position!\u201d<br/><br/>  Now place that on a card (or fill out your own, instead of writing back-story), give it a couple of key words at the top (\u201cretreat, avoid\u201d) that, at a glance,  tell you when you can use it, and you have a functional mechanic that can reward the player for using the language that we all came to hear. Even two or three replenish-able cards per player will give you a lot of Vancian dialogue where it's most needed \u2013 the times when you are actually doing something. Don't know Cugel-speak? By the end of the evening you'll probably have a pretty good grasp of it.<br/><br/>  Note also that it implies you are talking to someone. More people = more language = more possible gain. Could be useful for keeping a group together, say, I dunno, in a <i>game </i>in which you are <i>playing </i>some sort of <i>role</i>. There really should be a name for that sort of thing ... I know!<br/>Cugel's Exceedingly Excellent Oscillating Diatribe of Polyhedral Possibilities or CEEODPP for short. Pretty catchy, if I do say so myself. Put a couple of those Vancian adjectives and nouns at the bottom of the cards, to mix and match, and you hold in your hand (head) a Vancian spell system.<br/><br/>Game Chef 2011 was apparently about Shakespeare. I just looked up some  CEEODPP's  (See! It's already catching on) about the Bard's plays. They seem to focus on the form without addressing the language. Mangled Shakespearean dialogue can be used to comedic effect  but can get old really fast (\u201cVerily, forsooth, anon! Surely thou doth joketh! Nay, and prithee call me not Shirley, wastrel!\u201d).<br/><br/>I had occasion to write several pages of dialogue between two post-apoc mutants using only Shakespeare quotes (don't ask). It was actually pretty easy when I realized that the Bard used certain words repeatedly (villain, King, whore, etc). Using quotes with certain key words <b>bolded</b>, it's possible to have a fairly meaningful dialogue or even soliloquy on the spot, using snippets of original Shakespearean language. Just use it sparingly and where it counts (mechanically and dramatically).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433530/#Comment_433530" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T22:34:15+00:00" title="June  6, 2014 10:34PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2014 10:35PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Daniel, you've said a bunch of interesting stuff that I'd like to respond to, but I have to ask before I forget, did you see <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/433452#Comment_433452" rel="nofollow">my question</a> about your game?  I'd like to hear more about <i>My Daughter, the Queen of France</i> if you're up for it.  The "emote"/"don't emote" rules seem uniquely on-point.</blockquote>\nWhoops; yes, I saw it, but I think I got swept away in the rest of the discussion or something. Anyways, I'd be happy to talk about it.\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">@IceCreamEmperor</a>, <i>My Daughter</i> sounds highly relevant here.  Am I correct that you have both "make up a story" and "deliver it expressively" in the game, but they're not simultaneous?  You invent stuff while talking flat, and then you go through for a second pass, no longer inventing, and emote?</blockquote>\nIt's a bit more complicated than that, but that is a kind of extreme version of what could happen, yes.<br/><br/>In actual play, both are usually happening simultaneously -- or more accurately, you are always doing the first one, while the game explicitly limits what tools you have to do it. (Because delivering it expressively is always part of making up a story, IMO.)<br/><br/>In case people want to follow along without having to read the game, the way it works is: players play through the same scene more than once, and each time they play it they unlock new tools for doing so. The first time a scene is played, players are limited entirely to dialogue. The second time, they can describe character actions and external activity (such as weather, police sirens, fire, etc.). The third time they are allowed to directly convey character emotions. The fourth and final tool is soliloquys -- direct internal monologues addressed to the audience (who is Shakespeare.)<br/><br/>The third one is probably the most interesting one: you are not allowed to convey character emotion the first and second time you play the scene. This includes tonally, when speaking dialogue. It turns out that inventing dialogue and NOT imbuing it with obvious emotion is very challenging; you basically have to speak in monotone, or (my preferred analogy) imagine you are reading the words off a page without any understanding of the context.<br/><br/>Anyways, to relate this to the question, the reason that players are actually usually doing both is that they are also encouraged to revise the content of the scene every time they play through it; so different things happen, different words are spoken, different emotions conveyed, etc. In theory a scene could be almost completely different (other than its setting and which characters are participating.) BUT the players always have previous playthroughs to fall back on, and in practice groups tend to solidify their assumptions faster than the game forces them to.<br/><br/>Certainly the IDEA behind the game was that the scenes would be very similar, allowing the players to focus on each new element of description as it was added. Again, this turns out to be most effective with the addition of emotional expression: by the time players have gone through the scene twice <i>without</i> emotion, they tend to be <i>extremely motivated</i> to get some emotion into the scene, and extremely interested in what emotions those might/should be.<br/><br/>And to relate that to the broader conversation, one of the things that made me want to make the game was that I think people enjoy being challenged, and most games only challenge people fictionally; i.e. the challenge is to navigate the fiction successfully. What I wanted was a game where the challenge was <i>to play the game successfully</i>. I.e. to produce satisfying fiction in the first place. It's really hard to play a character who is playing another character, for example, but that is the basic premise of My Daughter. It's also really hard to avoid emotion while inventing dialogue; it's hard to create a complete scene using only dialogue; it's hard to come up with a dramatic soliloquy on the spot; and it's hard to help a father understand why his daughter doesn't want to talk to him anymore.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433533/#Comment_433533" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-07T00:56:12+00:00" title="June  7, 2014 12:56AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2014 12:57AM by Paul_D_L.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So, let's try it from a different angle. <b>If you make a game about numbers, you provide the numbers.

Even pro improv actors stumble now and again.</blockquote>\nI'm probably stating the obvious, but I just want to reinforce clearly that doing this mechanically isn't the only option. Granted, in the absence of absolutely inspired design, it might be the best option. Earlier in the thread I described a couple things like this: playing with vocab cards, for example.<br/>But, in very good games, the best part tends to be the squishy, creative part where the game hands things off to the players in such a way that something new emerges. Name it emergence, the fruitful void, or whatever lingo you like, but I like to call it a soft spot (but not a weak spot), because it's a place where the players can actually make the game better or worse and that's to the design's credit.<br/><br/>In fact, you go on to describe such a scenario: surrounding players in the language you want them to use in a way that it promotes its use. It doesn't require or even suggest that the players perform or narrate in that way, but if you skillfully arrange things, it makes it more likely.<br/>So, yes, the designer provides the language, but not as a mechanical requirement. You need some kind of mechanical requirement along the way, obviously, but it doesn't have to come in the form of a rule that directly demands fulfillment of the ultimate goal of the design - in this case, narrate well.<br/><br/>Although, rather than texture of the rule text, my personal taste leans towards rules for accomplishing that goal. I'm not 100% confident in this, but it seems to me, ideally speaking, you put players in positions in which their natural reactions create the results you want. Requiring players to speak in rhyming couplets is an okay example of this. You don't otherwise dictate what they say, so it's fun to see what people come up with on the fly. However, it might also be difficult to get anything approaching a serious tone with such a system (hey, I did say it was just an <i>okay</i> example).<br/><br/>I wish I had somewhere profound to go with this. I thought that maybe by writing it out, I'd hook on some inspiration; but it's late and at this point (especially because I'm trying to more deeply carve this result into my recent Game Chef entry), I wonder what existing games do this best. And pursuant to <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg%27s">@David_Berg's</a> question, what are some good ways to get this result for a game that is largely concerned with other results?<br/><br/>The first thought that pops into my head is to reduce the need for phrases like, "I draw my gun and jump into the mineshaft." Fictional positioning is rightly sacred to a lot of people, but it's a potentially powerful option to give absolute fiat to players for move selection, which comes first, placing full revelation of the fictional action after any kind of roll.<br/>So when we come to the mineshaft where we know the killer has taken a hostage, I say the associated phrase for my move, "I'm gonna Stick Out My Chin." Maybe, depending on what I want or what the GM chooses, that move allows me to get a first strike and/or learn something and/or draw attention to myself. But nobody gets to hear how, exactly, I'm Sticking Out My Chin until the results are final. I probably don't even have to decide until it comes out of my mouth. And because of that, there cannot be a situation in which somebody says, "no, you can't do that," "that doesn't make sense," etc.<br/>And when that fictional performance or narration rolls out, it's final in an uncommon way that I suspect could promote more involved narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433535/#Comment_433535" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-07T01:39:46+00:00" title="June  7, 2014  1:39AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2014 1:42AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>   Now place that on a card (or fill out your own, instead of writing back-story), give it a couple of key words at the top (\u201cretreat, avoid\u201d) that, at a glance,  tell you when you can use it, and you have a functional mechanic that can reward the player for using the language that we all came to hear.

It seems to me you are saying: if you want players to do something that is hard, help them practice. Which definitely seems like a good idea, though there are of course other ways to practice other than selective mimicry. So providing examples that can be used in play (which is also how Polaris works, as I described back when) is one way, as it gives players a starting point for their own improvisation, and a point of comparison so that their practice has some context.<br/><br/>Another way is just to ask them to do it over and over, in ways that are engaging -- either by making the repetition part of the play (see: My Daughter etc.), or by making it not seem so much like repetition (because other things are changing while the practiced part remains consistent.) <br/><br/>A third way is to provide a context in which failing or struggling to succeed at the thing is less risky. Roleplaying games in general already tend to do this; most people have much lower (or at least very different) aesthetic standards for dialogue in a roleplaying game than they do for dialogue in a movie or book. But people still struggle when put on the spot, and that struggling can get a lot worse when the thing they're trying to do is unfamiliar or difficult. So one thing you could do is give the players more time, so that some of that pressure is removed; another might be to create a context in the game where the result is itself meant to be provisional, exploratory, or otherwise speculative, so that players do not need to worry about 'getting it right'. This is also something my game does: first off, the players know they are going to get to play scenes more than once, so they can always try again; and secondly, the whole fictional premise is that of semi-competent friends of William Shakespeare trying to put on this weird 'play' thing, suggesting that they see all the scenes as basically a sort of dysfunctional 'rehearsal.' But there are of course a million ways to do this, and I am guessing improv acting is full of tools for reducing this kind of stress.<br/><br/>I am not sure any of this is particularly specific to the topic of better/more aesthetic/more involved narration, except insofar as that is a thing people would need to practice to get better at -- but I think the topic of 'games that help you practice their hard parts' (a subset of 'games that have acknowledged/purposefully hard parts') is a super-interesting and relevant one. It takes a particular kind of game, I think, to include elements that are going to be difficult/impossible to incorporate the first time the game is played, but still succeed in keeping players' interest and getting them past that point. Currently I feel like most games rely pretty heavily on social contract/mentoring, as well as of course a strong focus on supplemental reference materials and well-written instructions. Using the gameplay itself to achieve similar results* seems less common, beyond the very basic sense in which doing something helps you get better at it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* If anyone has ever played 'the Chairman's Game'/Mao, it is by far the best example I can think of of a game that does this thing. Sadly it is not a roleplaying game. (Though the esteemable Mcdaldno once made a roleplaying game based off of it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433552/#Comment_433552" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-07T21:22:11+00:00" title="June  7, 2014  9:22PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2014 9:23PM by zircher.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent read, all.

Like, I fail my defense roll, the GM describes how as the axe impact crashes over my shoulder and trough my armor I feel something crack inside me, under the force of the blow. But then I spent X resource to add: "As my vision blurs for a moment and I fall on one knee, I notice a gap on my enemy's guard. Perhaps I'm wrong, but if I'm not this is my chance to repay him for this pain..."<br/><br/>Ain't nothing too big as you can see. The GM could then ask me to spend another point of X resource to give me 1d6 of additonal damage if my next attack hits, or give it for free if he liked my detail. The goal here is that the player learns to ask the GM for the bonuses trough their narration instead of plainly argumenting or paying for it. Perhaps the X resource may be totally unnecessary if the players are given rigid procedures for doing this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19481/can-you-bribe-for-better-narration" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19481/can-you-bribe-for-better-narration" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19481/can-you-bribe-for-better-narration/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19481%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19481%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
