He picked up on something about how I play/run games that I've never noticed. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not empathize with (or advocate for) characters (as GM or Player). I don't even relate to characters in other forms of entertainment. What always fascinates me most is the situation(s) that characters create or that exist around characters. How much I like or dislike a character involves how situations form OR react to a characters presence. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of this peculiar mindset. When I play/run games I view characters as chess pieces to create dramatic/dangerous/interesting situations. I don't really care if they succeed or fail, I just want something interesting to happen. While this allows me to create DRAMA &amp; DANGER! This only lasts for a session or two, because those situations burn and fizzle out. The characters I create seem to not have any LIFE, TENSION, or PERSONALITY that exist beyond their screen time, but they have an immediacy and energy to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe flipside is I haven't seen the PCs as anything but chess pieces either. I view them as the catalyst to situations, and create intense danger and drama around what they want. This however has lead to, I quote "I feel like the world is doomed or I'm going to die every time I roll the dice". NOW the rolls weren't about dying or the fate of the  world, but because I am solely focused on DRAMA &amp; DANGER! I bring that kind of levity/feeling every time the dice are brought out. Which of course has lead to (and can lead to) some not-so-great play practices but those are my doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been working on this in the games I've been running by slowing the pacing a bit (I tend to run games at a break neck speed for 2 to 3 hours and call it good), and allowing things to develop more naturally (instead of you want X, well here is Y obstacle that threatens X, RIGHT NOW! BOOM! Whatcha gonna do!). But that is only addressing part of the problem by pointing out what my characters lack (which is great!), and how my situations could be challenged by a character rather than a Obstacle with Two Legs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'm wondering what people do to do to imbue characters with qualities beyond the immediate situation, and give their characters life off-screen as well as on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301794/#Comment_301794" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-22T17:04:13+00:00" title="November 22, 2010  5:04PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I don't think you're completely off base. Character traits in stories of any kind are only expressed through action in a situation. What I think you need is a broader variety of situations. Let's say you want to develop the romantic life of a character. Someone is interested in them, how do they respond? Someone who is involved with someone else is  open to a bit of canoodling on the side, what do they do?  One thing that can help is looking at areas where you don't know anything about a character. <br/><br/>I recently played a Dresden Files character, I had a detailed idea of his attitude towards the fae courts and the various things in his life, but not knowing a ton about the Dresden Universe, I didn't know how he saw wizards and vampires and so on. What I had to do was to be open to discovering that rather than playing it in advance, and have a GM willing to pick up on what I was doing and respond.  In the end he had a very detailed set of beliefs about wizards and sorcerers mostly driven by a romance with another player character in his past.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
