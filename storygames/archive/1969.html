                    So there's a thread about "Exploring the Rules through Gameplay" <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1962&amp;page=1#Item_12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1962&amp;page=1#Item_12</a><br/>
<br/>
and I'm wondering: are there any games where characters are created through play?  Like, in traditional RPG's, you build your dude, and then you play.  Sometimes it's wicked fast (like with Capes click-n-locks), but I'm wondering about games where that doesn't exist at all.  (I imagine they do, because I'm not up on this stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
Like, Jonathan Walton's KKKKK comes to mind, where one player must be Kublai Khan, and the other player must be his assassin, and the details about their personalities show up through flashbacks.  But, in a way, that seems like a cheat because (to a very small extent) those characters are handed to you, rather than you building it entirely from scratch.                </div>

                            Mike Holmes can weigh in on this better than I can but at least in his HQ campaign you just start with a name and a general concept and build it while you play.                        </div>

                            I'm stalled out on my game <i>Heartbreaker</i>, but it's actually entirely about adding, removing, and changing traits on a character (who begins as a name, a social role, and a statement of identity). The "winning condition", such as it is, is how closely your ending set of 3 Traits matches your starting statement of identity. So that's character creation through conflict resolution.                        </div>

You mention Dogs: technically, only a little bit of Dogs characters is resolved through play itself, right?  The accomplishments phase?  You don't decide, in play, my guy is Strong, Conflicted, Well-Rounded and whatever, right?                        </div>

                            I think a lot of super-high-detail character generation systems are play of their own - Champions, HERO and GURPS leap to mind.                        </div>

                            James, <em>Dogs</em> doesn't do character creation in play, except for the Accomplishment, which I had totally forgotten about.  What I'm talking about is how fallout is an as-you-play character development/advancement system.  Mechanically, it's a system for putting things on your character sheet.  Character creation is nothing more than putting things on your character sheet, too, so a fallout-like system could be used to create a character, and then continue to be used to develop and modify the character.<br><br>I have <em>absolutely no idea</em> how to do that, but it'd be nifty.                        </br></br></div>

                            Take a look at Spirit of the Century (from EvilHat): the two methods of chargen are normal and "on the fly"<br/><br/>Both are done as a group activity, and from every AP thread (and review) I've read the chargen phase is entertaining just as the game itself.<br/><br/>The standard method is done intermingling the character backgrounds by being the protagonist of one Pulp Story, and being the "guest star" in the Pulp Stories of other characters.<br/><br/>With the On-the-fly method you just have to write down a couple of concepts for your character, a name, and just choose the relevant skill levels and stunts as you face obstacles.                        </div>

                            I'm not sure why, but I'm really digging games that involve little to no time spent on character creation. We've just started our Spirit of the Century game and I used a blend of conventional and on the fly generation. We worked out aspects and so forth in advance as normal, but then we just launched into the game with an apex skill apiece. The rest (along with stunts) I plan on letting the players fill in as they go along.<br/><br/>A couple of the games I'm working on now involve character creation occurring as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Six Bullets for Vengeance, which is told back to front, starts with everybody having a blank sheet and then you reveal things in play as you go along and jot them down on your sheet.<br/><br/>Yesterday's Tomorrow on the other hand has the character creation process as an actual part of the game. The first session has everybody's characters hauled in by the police and interrogated over some fictional crime - the answers they give in character inform their stats and skills! Not sure if it'll work yet though ...                        </div>

                            I do believe that there was a game... <i>Immortal</i>, maybe? I believe you could, in the middle of play, call a flashback to gain a skill. Like, you're tied up, so you call a flashback and declare that your guy (who's an immortal ala <i>Highlander</i>) was an apprentice to a magician or some shit in the past. (That that I ever owned or played the game.)<br/><br/>This was discussed a couple of times at the Forge. It's probably worth doing a search there.<br/><br/>Now, I think you're probably talking mechanical chargen here, but something that came out of those discussions at the Forge was that pretty much all characters are developed <i>narrratively</i> or <i>dramatically</i> through play. Like, in <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, chargen says very little about who the character really is, as a person. During the first couple of scenes of a game of tMW, players often flounder, trying to find who the character is. But after a little bit, they find a direction they want to take the character and then run with it. It's like this in pretty much all games, IME. It takes a session or two for players to get comfortable with a character, again IME.                        </div>

                            In my currently-stalled project Acts of Desperation, part of my attempted adherence to five-act structure is that the characters' stats are revealed (and placed on the character sheet as they are revealed) in special scenes in Act I which are dedicated to that purpose. This follows the fictional format of establishing who the characters are, what resources they have, what they care about etc. at the beginning of the story, through narrative. I have a strong suspicion that this is one of the many aspects of the project that needs more work but I think it's a fruitful idea.                        </div>

                            In a WFRP I currently play in, we played our characters as children the first two sessions. We only had a very bare bone character creation (basic stats and a few skills), and then fleshed out the characters as we jumped some years forward to play the characters as young adults. In this way most of the characters was formed doing play.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about this was that the group became much more exited about the other players' characters; much more that I have seen in any other games.<br/><br/>After this experience I have been interested in the idea of character creation doing game, so the players know each others characters better, which I hope will result in a more intense game. Unfortunately I have not been able to work it in to any of my current designs. <br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>

                            The core of Universalis is adding and removing traits. The system is smooth and effective in doing it.  Characters are often introduced with a role and sometimes a name, and get more complicated as players spend their resources to add depth and as the characters encounter conflicts and grow.<br/>

                            HeroQuest, definitely (and its lovely new incarnation in <i>Mythic Russia</i>).  In fact, it's one of the three official character creation methods (along with writing a 200-word essay and just plain listing a bunch of keywords.)  You just start with the vaguest outline and flesh it out in play, as inspiration (or necessity) strikes you.                        </div>

                            I think Dogs works just fine if you allow players to leave Trait and Stat dice unassigned in the same way as Relationship dice.<br/><br/>A simple, brutal method for Chargen-as-you-go is just to start every Dog out with only Stat Dice, and play from there. They begin play with their stats and one trait (from their Initiation.) The first few towns are likely to be a disaster from the Dogs' point of view, as they will have to band together to achieve almost anything, and escalation will be even more tempting than usual. <br/><br/>This would also mean that they are going to gain more Fallout, most likely adding at least one trait per conflict. <br/><br/>I think from the point of view of characterisation this would be pretty interesting.                        </div>

                            There was a AD&amp;D1 module, N4 Treasure Hunt by Aaron Allston, where PCs started out as talentless 0-level PCs, and based on the sorts of actions they undertook, they'd eventually gain proper stats, alignment, and class abilities. The interesting thing was that you'd effectively get yourself a custom class out of this with sets of abilities grafted together that you couldn't get by making a normal 1st-level character. This system was later grandfathered in as a set of optional rules in the AD&amp;D2 DMG.<br/><br/>I mention this only as historical trivia. I always thought it sounded pretty neat at the time, though.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  I think for some games, chargen in play is cool. But I feel for other games you might be stuck with a char trait that was strategically or tactically advantageous at the time, but doesn't match the character vision as the char develops. Also, I feel that having an idea what your char is about before play has some real advantages to generating story.<br/>
  FYI, Falling Leaves is a great example of chargen in play. The only thing determined before play is the name I think.<br/>

                            I really want to do character creation as part of the ongoing course of a game.  Maybe you guys can help me out with two of the concerns that are stumping me:<br/>
<br/>
1) Blank page syndrome:  Without any starting structure, and particularly without having any real idea of what other characters are in the game, aren't you asking a lot of the first person who's supposed to take a scene and start defining their character?<br/>
<br/>
2) When do you stop?:  If you're coming right up to the climax, and you <i>suddenly discover</i> that your character has a skill that they've never shown any indication of, which proves to be perfect for this conflict, isn't that something of a <i>deus ex machina</i>?<br/>
<br/>
The second one I think I've got a solution to (character traits have power that is correlated to how much they've been foreshadowed and exposited), but I'm not sure it's the right solution.  And the first one?  I don't even have a thought about that.  It's a stumper :-(                        </div>

                            Hey, Tony.<br><br>As for the first question, I do find that players need a "seed" to start off from, much like a seed crystal.  On the other hand, the simple requirements of roleplaying also dictate that each character will need to be defined in terms of how they appear to the other characters.  Cause your character steps into a scene, right, and you need to tell everybody else what they see.  I find that the initial appearance of a character works just fine as a seed.  Even though I don't like the character, Cordelia from <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> is a prime example; she stepped onto screen and you knew what she was all about, and then character development grew that out and later subverted it.<br><br>For an AP example, when we playtested Sailing for Atlantis, which is character generation throughout play, my character started out as "Dressed in a military uniform and introducing himself as Astor."  And I knew from the outset that he most certainly was not just a simple soldier -- I riffed off of that "who is he really, and why is he pretending to be a soldier" for the first half of the game or so, which built up enough character momentum that when I had an opportunity for him to reveal his true nature, it went off perfectly: oh, he's part of a vast international conspiracy to dupe the Queen of the Underworld and engineer a new Golden Age.  Which all developed organically out of "why's he pretending to be a soldier?"<br><br>Regarding the second question, the Deus Ex Machina thing was entirely possible in Sailing for Atlantis, but it never came up.  Now, this may be because of the game itself and its ridiculous scope.  At one point I basically bought the Flying Dutchman in its freakiest incarnation possible and the rest of the table nodded and went, "Yeah, okay."  I don't know if character-generation-through-play will work very well in a more tactical game, since tactics is often shepherding resources carefully, and giving everybody a deck full of jokers throws tactics out the window.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

I think a storytelling game based <i>solely</i> on painting a protagonist into terminal situations and concocting imaginative <i>di ex machina</i> to get him or her out might be fun. Sort of like <i>Baron Munchausen</i>. That's probably a tangent, though.                        </div>

                            My entry for last year's Iron Game Chef competition, 'Liquid Crystal', started all characters off with a blank character sheet that was filled in during play. The basic premise is that all characters are soulless, unemotional robots who have yet to develop a personality. Through play, and the decisions that they make, each robot becomes more and more an individual. However at the beginning of the game the only information they have is their serial number (which is normally chosen at random anyway). They don't even have a name until the player feels their robot is ready to make such a decision.<br/><br/>Ash                        </div>

Maybe I've got a vastly different version of FUDGE, but I've always felt that the system hardly has any kind of character creation rules to speak of in any case <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> I'm not saying it's not a good book, as it can be very useful to someone setting out to make their own RPG, but I always thought that the entire game felt half-finished at best and needed a lot of additional work to get anything vaguelly playable out of it.<br/><br/>Still, that's just my opinion. Never was a FUDGE fan.<br/><br/>Ash                        </div>

                            Hi Tony,<br/><br/>I'm designing a game called, "Silence Keeps Me A Victim." In that game I am using a playable character creation. The characters aren't blank slates although they have the same starting attributes. The Attributes are Mask, Voice, Shame, and perhaps Pride. Characters start with a Mask rating that decreases and gain in Voice and Shame. I'm not sure how Pride figures in yet, it just sounds like it needs to be involved. Anyway the changing of attributes suggests things about the characters but doesn't really say things. What speaks loudly is that characters will have traits that define them similiar to Dogs, that they gain through game play. Anyway....<br/><br/>So I think to have playable character creation you need something to play with to start and this beginning thing shouldn't be designed as physics like strength, stamina, etc, but should be things that allow the effecting of fiction while leaving room for the explanation of them being strong,quick, clever, well connected, etc. I think it would be really interesting to have a game where those descriptions narrowed your opprotunities to describe anything but strengthened your ability to use those descriptions. For instance you kick the door open, maybe you get more "dice" now for describing solving problems with strength and less for other descriptions. This is not what I'm doing however, it's just a thought.<br/><br/>I then think in creating a playable Character Creation, you need to gain things that define the character, rather than gain things that define the characters ability. I think this may help alleviate but not completely prevent Deus Ex Machina. In my game the traits you gain are actually assigned by someone else which I think totally prevents D.E.M. but has other problems it can instill.                        </div>
