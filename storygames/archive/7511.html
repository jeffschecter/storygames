I really want to try and get the development stage of this project out of the way by the end of October and was hoping some of you fine people might be interested in giving me a hand playtesting the final stages. If you are please contact me <a href="http://www.giantbrain.co.uk/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>I also have another project on the go called 'Combined Arms'. This is a card game that a mate of mine made and that I am putting out. It has been played quite a bit but I now want to put it into the hands of people who have no knowledge of the game. The game is a fast playing tactical wargame affair, that has a clever little mix of rock, paper, scissor mechanics. Again anyone interested contact me <a href="http://www.giantbrain.co.uk/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>Thanks for your time<br/><br/>Iain                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
