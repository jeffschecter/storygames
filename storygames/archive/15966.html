You play a drifter who comes to a town looking to satisfy some basic human longings (sleep in a warm bed. quit the booze) and gets mixed up in all kinds of sordid local dealings. He;s caught between the demands of the Devil and the Man, and based on mechanics the possible outcomes are: he settles down and comes to peace with himself, he comes under the sway of the Devil and takes up a life of crime and violence, he comes under the sway of the Man and settles down to a life of unfulfilling conformity, or most commonly) he moves on to the next town. Only in the last case may you use that Drifter again for play.<br/><br/>Now, I haven't played enough games to try this out, but there's a lot of potential for playing the same drifter multiple times, or playing drifters in intersecting storylines: like, one of the mechanics lets the Drifter's player pay points to redeem an NPC and make them Decent Folk. In one game I played, the person in control of a Decent Person had her leave town herself, and declared she was becoming another Drifter. I haven't played this game with that person since then, but that idea really excited me.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_363299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363299/#Comment_363299" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T07:06:20+00:00" title="February 28, 2012  7:06AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember Tomorrow does this.

It's not mechanically reinforced like IAWA does with the Owe List and whatnot (Rustbelt basically 'gets out of your way' to do it, while mechanics produce pacing that all but forces individual stories to be short), but it's how the game is meant to be played, and how it's most meaningful (read: fun and rewarding over the long term) to play it. A Rustbelt 'campaign' looks like, say, the Sin City books, or the Martian Chronicles (in structure, not content).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
