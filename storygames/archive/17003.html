We're also full on Thursday from 4-6pm, but that's partly because I over-scheduled fixed games for that time.<br/><br/>Thursday night and Sunday morning are wide open for gaming, so if you're looking for an open window for running games, those might be the times.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386646/#Comment_386646" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-08T09:50:56+00:00" title="August  8, 2012  9:50AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's fantastic.

Dice are already packed, and if someone absolutely has to play in a particular set, I've got the monthly releases on my nook.<br/><br/>I think I could run Monsterhearts, but I don't have the luggage space or the spoons to print out the material I'd need for that, and e-text doesn't quite cut it for skins. Still, if I show up at GoD, and you're someone who'd normally run Monsterhearts and has the material, but wants to play instead of MC, feel free to hand the book to me and tell me I'm running it.<br/><br/>I'd love to get into demos of Marvel, A/N/N, TBF, School Daze, and lots of other stuff, but I don't know how likely that will be. Naturally, I signed up for a bunch of 4 hour games, and I've got shopping scheduled, and I do need to follow the 5/2/1 rule. Well, okay, I may turn 5 into 3 or 4 one or two nights, but... I've yet to find a sure fire way to perk me up when I start to crash (and the 5 hour energy drinks don't count because I crash hard afterwards and wake up with a hangover-sans-alcohol.

So, I got to the GoD room once, to drop off some generics I wasn't using (and I had to assure the guy taking them that, really, and truly, I didn't need them -- I kept four, which I never did manage to use or pass on). But, having the Fiasco material didn't bulk out my luggage (and for a bit, I thought I'd be doing something at the Yoggie meet on Wednesday. Alas, everyone decided to Be Sensible and not wreck ourselves before the con technically started). But, can I safely assume that at future events, I can say, "Hand me a kit, and I'll facilitate"?<br/><br/>Last year, I did neither of the two events I had tickets for (one GM was a no-show, and I returned the other ticket in favor of an Amaranthine Demo and a Morgan Ellis Kerberos Fate adventure). I also played in three slots at GoD. This year, I signed up for seven events, enjoyed them all, and had my eyes nearly pop out each time I saw the line for GoD. Just how did that work in practice? I mean, did it move fast, and folks who weren't holding out for a particular event got into a game fast? Or did folks have to wait around a while? I'm wondering if GoD needs something like, oh, the size of the space of First Exposure.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387510/#Comment_387510" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-20T05:33:05+00:00" title="August 20, 2012  5:33AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2012 5:33AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The line did move very fast, but it was intimidating.

Is that accurate? Did folks running games at GoD feel like you were pitching and selling specific games, as much as you were just enjoying playing them with new people? I know Jenskot made some noises beforehand about being concerned about running Apocalypse World because it might not be available for sale at GenCon. That's pretty different from how I've approached running games at the PAX GoD, where I've done 3-4 hour games that were more about having a great experience sharing games I enjoyed and less about generating sales.

There's a big banner outside room 238 that says Games on Demand. It's 1:45; there's a line. You get in the line. By 1:50 you are in front of a desk and whiteboard. The whiteboard lists available GMs and the games they are running and the open seats in them. A host greets you and lets you know games are two or four hours and cost 1 or 2 generic tickets ($2 each, you can't buy them here because Gen Con). Questions about games? What would you like to play? Meerkat Legionaries is not on the board and no one is around to run it - you can check back later, Mendez may be running it at 6 but maybe not, we'l let him know you are interested. RIght now can I interest you in Ferret Fusiliers? Two seats left and it's being run by Terry Romero at table 11. It's a really cool Meerkat Legionaries hack by Anna Kreider...Sounds good, you go over to table 11 and give Terry a generic and you're off to the races. The host adjusts seat count on the white board.<br/><br/>Or maybe your heart is set on the meerkat game and we ask around, including in the line, if anybody can run it. If someone volunteers, we send them (and you) to table 14 in room 421 and add them (and 3 more empty seats) to the white board. If not hey, try back later, we're volunteers and we run what we love and are in the mood for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387583/#Comment_387583" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-20T17:21:19+00:00" title="August 20, 2012  5:21PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It sounds a bit like the demoing role that was previously handled booth-side has now partially migrated over to GoD, which was initially created (as I recall) as a space for playing full, more relaxed sessions (like 4 hours) of indie games (i.e., basically the pick-up counterpart to IGE). Is that accurate? Did folks running games at GoD feel like you were pitching and selling specific games, as much as you were just enjoying playing them with new people</blockquote>\nI've had three clear goals in my mind for the last year or so I've been trying to organize GoD: <br/>1) create a central gathering place for the indie community at the convention<br/>2) facilitate fun gaming by matching volunteer GMs with eager players (corollary: share our games and enthusiasm with a wider audience)<br/>3) help those players find where they can buy these great games, so the creators/publishers can keep making them<br/><br/>That's pretty much it for me, and as it happens, it does fill a bit of the void left by the lack of demos in the dealer hall.

We had a list of games in mind to play. We showed up, and we asked for those games. If they weren't on offer at the moment, we played something else. (And that happened once.) Over the course of the con, about half our games were at GOD and the other half we played at night. At GOD, we played <i>Bulldogs</i> with Brennan Taylor, <i>Technoir</i> with Jeremy Keller (in Hong Kong, yeah!), <i>Durance</i> with Steve Segedy, and <i>Dungeon World</i> with Jason Morningstar. We had fun, which was why we were there. I did end up buying Technoir but I was going to buy it anyway. That's why we asked for it.  <br/><br/>We <i>wanted</i> two hour games. We would not have signed up for a four hour game. <br/><br/>I go to Gen Con to game but also to eat good food and to talk to people and to go to seminars and to wander around in wonder and love geeks and to drink alcoholic beverages and to game at night. I don't have time for four hour games. I used GOD more this year than ever before. (I don't know what it was like last year -- I didn't go to the con.) We played longer games at night, like we played <i>ACKS</i>with Tavis Allison in the Embassy Suites on Thursday, and I ran The Fantasy Trip Friday night and Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game Saturday night. That was the right amount of gaming. <br/><br/>I think GOD would be simpler without having to juggle the event-timeslot specific tickets with generics. I also think it'd be great if there were a better way to send waves of "these are the games on offer" along the scary line ahead of time. But I don't think these were really problem problems, just things, you know. I felt like I was seeing a lot of people getting to play stuff they wanted to play like Monsterhearts and Dungeon World and Fiasco and everything else they liked. Every game I played at Games on Demand was one I hadn't actually played before, and three of the four were games I or my friends had on our lists of "games we want to play at Gen Con." <br/><br/>So thank you, folks, volunteers and organizers, and players too.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17003/games-on-demand-at-gen-con" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17003/games-on-demand-at-gen-con" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17003/games-on-demand-at-gen-con/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17003/games-on-demand-at-gen-con/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17003/games-on-demand-at-gen-con/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17003/games-on-demand-at-gen-con/p5">5</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17003/games-on-demand-at-gen-con/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17003%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17003%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Games on Demand  at Gen Con - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17003/games-on-demand-at-gen-con/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Games on Demand  at Gen Con - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17003/games-on-demand-at-gen-con/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="So, for me.

Just for me.<br/><br/>I went into the Games on Demand room Thursday and it was rocking. Due to the confines and the sheer amount of excited gaming, I could not hear ANYTHING. I have some slight hearing loss from poor life choices in high school (those sub woofers were <i>AWESOME</i>). The only thing I did at Games on Demand was Saturday evening when I saw everything was overstuffed and some folks looked like they might not get a game, I drew away four folks for some quieter hall gaming down the way and ran some Lady Blackbird.<br/><br/>It was great that Games on Demand was so close to the dealer room and very exciting to see it so busy. But at that volume level, it is not personally useful to me and I would not choose to play a role-playing game when I cannot hear anything. I don't know of a solution in the con space that is feasible, but well, it was my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trevis" title="Trevis"><img alt="Trevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/353/nM6YYC8AOVW23.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trevis">Trevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387605/#Comment_387605" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-20T20:52:38+00:00" title="August 20, 2012  8:52PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my part on the AW games I was pretty much straight up using <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/13941/aw-convention-demo-advice#Item_24" rel="nofollow">Joe Macdaldno's advice.</a> on running it.  Setting up one person as the area boss and the other as the pain in the ass.  It worked really well, even in a limited time.  5 is the max for that though, IMO, and 4 is better.  People pretty much got to see what it was all about.<br/><br/>MH I think I need to cut to specific playbooks and make sure we've got triangles set up from the get go.  I got them anyway, but it took more work than we really had time for.  Although everyone at my table said that they really liked it even when they didn't expect to.

I ran Psi*Run twice for four players with four questions each, one game ended early, the other I cut short when we reached two hours with one player having answered three questions. At least one player went straight down to try to buy it, but I think it turned out mot to be on sale.<br/><br/>I ran Monster of the Week for three and four players. That was an interesting experience as it was my first time running MotW on the fly, but I pitched a strong group concept and it worked well (essentially Nights Black Agents with demons instead of vampires).\n<blockquote>We need to synthesize lessons learned for running AW-engine games in two hour increments. It's a really awkward length of time for the games, so what do you put in there? How do you show what's special while offering a fun experience? For DW I took out XP, gave everyone a single starting bond and no gear. The adventure had six rooms along two paths, with a map laid out on the table. It's not <i>exactly</i> DW but you get to really see 7-9 in action, all the moves, and all the fun character-specific stuff. I think it's enough to give you a clear idea of what the game is about.</blockquote>\nI ran Dungeon World twice for five and four players. I used the Living Dungeon World XP system (was BBC XP), which includes only one bond but otherwise used full chargen and idiom highlighting, then ran as normal. In my first game (5 players) we got through a trap sequence, a lengthy battle scene with mass of goblins, and a fight against a fearsome single monster (1-2 players leveled). In my second, we played though a physical obstacle, two potential fights that turned into negotiations, a pitched fight against a handful of mermen, and a final temptation of the paladin scene.<br/><br/>I was initially unsure of the 2 hour slots, and it did feel a bit like I was selling the game, but having experienced it now, it seems like the right way to go. There's no room for flab in a 2 hour slot, so you usually get a tight story.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387618/#Comment_387618" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T05:17:06+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  5:17AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally able to get on line after the show.

What I ended up doing was removing XP, though I had them all do the level up move when they made their characters. <br/><br/>Each slot I ran we improvised a different adventure based on what players were bringing to the table. I think that helps build a set of common expectation, and then it just becomes a matter of pacing, and direction for the GM. We always started mid/late delve. Depending on the level of enthusiasm of the group the harder I pushed them. I had my most enthusiastic group fight a dragon while plummeting into the abyss, so it was kind of like a big boss battle that worked surprisingly well.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387647/#Comment_387647" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T08:14:34+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  8:14AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Chris,<br/><br/>Sorry again for the confusion about getting Josh on the schedule- I'd missed most of the discussion about it here on SG and I was a little confused.

I'll see if I can dig up his source later. Here's the basic structure.<br/><br/>Ask: "So, who's in charge?" Somebody will chime in, or get volunteered once the players realize you mean it.<br/>Ask: "So, why are you in charge? Is it because you run the cult? ...toss out Hocus... Is it because you've got the biggest, baddest gang in town? ...Chopper... Because you run the joint at the center of it all? ...Maestro'D... Or just cause you're the leader?" ...Hardholder...<br/>A picks one of those four playbooks, take the rest out of play.<br/><br/>Ask: "Who wishes they were running the place instead?" Toss out Battlebabe, Brainer, Skinner, briefly explain them.<br/>B picks one of those three playbooks, take the rest out of play.<br/><br/>(optional)Point at the person who's "in charge". Ask: "So, who's got A's back?" Toss out Gunlugger, Savvyhead, Angel.<br/>C picks one of those three playbooks, take the rest out of play. I never ended up using this one.<br/><br/>Spread the playbooks that haven't been shown yet for the remaining players, and let them take their pick.<br/>AW play proceeds as usual from there: ask leading questions, especially about the hardhold/cult/gang, why B thinks they should be in charge instead, inject something that's a threat to A's power. Don't bother with formal fronts: just point them at each other, ratchet up the intensity of what's going on, and play to see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387664/#Comment_387664" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T09:36:48+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  9:36AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The last game I ran was Monsterhearts for 4 players in 2 hours and by then 2 hours was pretty good!

I think the game organizing would be much better served outside of the game room. I don't know if this is possible, but having the whiteboard out in the hall before you go into the room would allow passerbys to see what is going on and see what sort of options are available. Also, this allows people to see open slots and offer to run games without waiting until they are close to the front of the line. And, might help with the noise level. <br/><br/>I do want to say we only had a chance to play one game at GoD, but I had a sincere blast and wanted to thank Juliet (not sure if she's reading this) for running Fiasco off the cuff for us. Otherwise, we'd probably not have been able to play as we only had a couple hours left before having to leave and the other games were full. <br/><br/>So, I'd highly encourage empowering GMs who want to help run games and make it super easy for them. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387771/#Comment_387771" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T12:00:23+00:00" title="August 22, 2012 12:00PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing with Juliet grabbing people out of the line and running a game - I really want this to be more common.

I.E. You gather all interested parties, there are sign-up sheets placed out with game descriptions on them for people to browse and choose from, and then there's a huge pitch session where the people running games that aren't full pitch them to the audience and then people break off to play games and some organizers sort out what to do with anyone who can't find a game (usually by roping them together to play something). We've gotten pretty fluent at making that work and it feels both very community oriented (because you get to hear about a lot of the games that you're not playing but might play next time) and avoids having to wait in line and making weird status games between the volunteers running the event and the people waiting in line (i.e. we are not there to serve them or order them around, but people just like them who've decided to create a space where people can have fun playing indie games).<br/><br/>Any way we could make that happen in the future?  Have any of those practices expanded to other parts of the country or does that sound alien to folks from the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387812/#Comment_387812" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T15:38:22+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  3:38PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PAX gives us pretty much free reign.

It lets us schedule further in the future, lets GMs easily put up something for the game they want to run, and can subtly shape how we create sessions.<br/><br/>The group hug/donut/pitch session is a bit tougher, since at least at PAX very few people plan their day around games on demand. Getting critical mass (but not too many) would be really tough. But hey, maybe we can try it with the dinner rush sometime this year. It's already kind of what we did last year: if there were a lot of people waiting a GM would pitch a game and whoever wanted would step up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387816/#Comment_387816" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T16:44:58+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  4:44PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think all of John's suggestions sound pretty great.

I spent all of my GoD experience running <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/104650/School-Daze?affiliate_id=262479" rel="nofollow">School Daze</a>, mostly for folks who had never heard of it before. I ended up running six 2-hour sessions between Saturday and Sunday. By the end, I was burnt out, but it was good. The players generally seemed to have good to excellent experiences. The only exception to that was my last Sunday session. If you played in that (Sci-Fi game, set on Trowbridge Intergalactic Flight School), I'm sorry. I wasn't at the top of my game, and I don't think I managed to get everyone invested enough in what was going on to try the tricks I used with the story. <br/><br/>Overall, GoD was well-run, and I had a blast. The space was my only concern. Twice, I nearly didn't have a table available due to how packed it was. I managed to get a spot in 239 the first time (which was so loud that we were all shouting to each other to be heard across the table), and the second, I ended up in a Sagamore ballroom, which was bliss. The high ceiling diffused the sound to an amazing degree, and it was a joy to run a session there.<br/><br/>Speaking as a small-press outfit consisting of me, myself, and I, GoD was the perfect venue for me to show off my game. If I had tried to schedule regular slots during GenCon, I feel strongly that I would have been lost in the shuffle. GoD gave me a space where my game was on equal footing. I heard that some folks even passed up Dungeon World to play School Daze, which was flattering to the nth degree. I'm very much looking forward to GoD at all my major conventions next year; Origins, GenCon, and (hopefully) Pax Prime. It's a great place to game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387867/#Comment_387867" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T04:54:17+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  4:54AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JWalt, it'd be neat if we could organize at a 36,000-person event that rigorously monetizes every square foot the same way we organize at a 75-person <a href="http://forgemidwest.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">gathering</a> of <a href="http://campnerdly.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">friends</a>.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387868/#Comment_387868" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-23T05:08:22+00:00" title="August 23, 2012  5:08AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amen.

This past year, Gamestorm let us pretty much run a mini-con within a con, which was really cool. That said, there's definitely something to be said for using a number of different models, so we can keep trying out different organizational structures, and certainly some cons may not work the same way as others.<br/><br/>Sage is right that at PAX Prime, for example, people don't really stick to a "slot" structure, so it probably makes sense (as we've done in the past) to start every hour or when there's an available table. People are wandering around doing and experiencing things and not sitting down for particular 2-4 hour blocks. But that doesn't mean I don't wish we were actually able to pitch games to a large group of folks and then have them self-divide into tables to play. As it is, they might sit down to one game and have no idea what any of the others are like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388259/#Comment_388259" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-25T22:48:17+00:00" title="August 25, 2012 10:48PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yes, I had an idea of a back room, where things would be slightly more anarchic.

I also got to meet some really great people at the GoD room. Kudos to everyone who worked to put it together.<br/><br/>A quick comment about the 4 hour blocks. My friend and I both agreed that "giving up" four hours for a single game was a lot of time. Many people have stated that two hours is not enough, what about a 3 hour block? I viewed GoD as my method for getting exposed to many games I have not been able to try out. I was not looking for a full blown session with experience, etc. I might be in the minority on that however.<br/><br/>That said, I really like the idea of a crowd gathering and a GM pitching their game to recruit players. I think that could turn into chaos though. Some games are seriously popular and would draw massive crowds. Lesser known games would struggle (like the guy I witnessed trying to get enough players to get the Mongolian Goat Rodeo, or something like that, going).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388275/#Comment_388275" name="Item_146" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T04:35:52+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  4:35AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2012 5:30AM by Graham.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Yes, I had an idea of a back room, where things would be slightly more anarchic.

From looking at the boards, there was a lot of Fiasco, Dungeon World and Marvel. It is hyper-organised. (That's how it was last year and, from what I've seen, this year was turned up to 11).<br/><br/>That's great and I'm glad it's so successful. It's very different from the Games on Demand I saw three years ago: bustling, anarchic and friendly. If you arrived halfway through a slot, someone would slot you into a game or start a new one. The games were much quirkier: Steal Away Jordan, Capes, Misery Bubblegum.<br/><br/>Leaving aside my personal preferences for the moment, I'd really like to see smaller games supported. I was glad to see Hyperreality and Dog Eat Dog on the boards: I wanted more Witch, Ninja Panda Taco, Durance, Don't Walk In Winter Wood and all the tinier games I've forgotten. (The perverse part of me thinks that, if all the seats are full, that's a signal that the games aren't  weird enough.)<br/><br/>I hope this doesn't sound churlish. I'm delighted it's become so successful. What I really want is to be able to turn up to Games on Demand at 11.30 and be slotted into a tiny game I've never heard of.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388278/#Comment_388278" name="Item_147" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T05:00:50+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  5:00AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2012 5:02AM by jenskot.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of good points (especially showing up at 11:30, which I'll talk about towards the end) but I wanted to clear up a few points:<br/><br/>Games On Demand had lots of quirky games. There were also many games that were formed on the fly not accounted for on the white boards. We had lots of spill over space outside the main rooms so GMs who weren't on the schedule could show up and run whatever they wanted (several people came to GoD to recruit people for Jeep Form games). For example, a player really wanted to play Kagematsu badly but there were enough players to make it happen on the schedule when they wanted it to. But I got together with Kira, wrangled more people who weren't event at GoD and made it happen!<br/><br/>Variety depended on the GMs and what players wanted to play. Mendez was willing to run Steal Away Jordan 24 hours a day for 4 days if there were enough players. If Steve was at GoD more (and I'm super glad for the time he was there), there would have been more Witch. If Jen was GMing, there would have been lots of Ninja Panda Taco. I played lots of Misery Bubblegum in past GoDs because Tony was running it (and I would run it myself now if I understood how to).<br/><br/>Where we could have done a lot better was in pitching quirky games. Next time we will have more GMs pitching games to players before people choose games. Having 2 hour and 4 hour game waiting areas and starting the process 15 minutes before a slot will fix a lot of this. <br/><br/>GoD was also incredibly loud last year in its previous form. It was loud this year as well but we have many ideas on how to improve this. <br/><br/>The area I'm not sure how to deal with is people showing up after all the GMs are full of players. We tried asking players to GM themselves or recruiting GMs but that was difficult. I don't know the answer here and am very open to suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388295/#Comment_388295" name="Item_148" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T08:46:22+00:00" title="August 26, 2012  8:46AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the reasons for the big-name games is we were not getting your usual indie crowd. As a way to get people into trying more indie games, hooking them with Fiasco, Dungeon World and Marvel is a great and acessible way to lure them in.

If you want Games on Demand to be different, accept the invitations we've made to be involved. The event is what it is today because a few of us stepped in to keep it from dying altogether, and this is the result. I'm always happy to have suggestions, and more importantly, volunteers to help put those suggestions into action.<br/><br/>As for format issues, every GoD implementation is going to vary from show to show based on how the conventions work. Gen Con requires us to sell tickets for space. We could go punk rock and take over a hotel lobby, or do it in someone's hotel room, but in my opinion that's a crappy approach that won't last. And if we're selling tickets, we have to charge a minimum of $2 per two hour slot. We can do one or three hour games, but the charge is the same ($2 or $4) as playing longer.<br/><br/>In terms of noise, I agree. It's always a problem, at every show in every event that I've been to. We might be able to fix it by getting ourselves into a larger room, but there are no guarantees there.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388304/#Comment_388304" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-26T10:46:57+00:00" title="August 26, 2012 10:46AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve!<br/><br/>At the next convention where there's a Games on Demand, that isn't too loud and has space for me to run games, I'll be there.

We do it every year at GoPlayNW and Fabricated Realities, for large numbers of people, and it works fine. Heck, Ben Robbins and his crew do it every week at Story Games Seattle (without the sign-up sheets). In neither of those cases is it overwhelmingly loud or chaotic. Johnzo even made it happen at Gamestorm in a less-than-ideal space. There's some planning and leadership involved and with large numbers of people it requires more patience and cooperation, but it works. It's a known and practiced method.

We were next to the Pathfinder room and attracted a lot of people who mainly play Pathfinder. Many of them wanted to try a "Story Game", and to them, that meant Fiasco.

It's simply amazing.<br/><br/>I've only been a part of the "indie" community for a little over a year, but I've been blown away by how much growth I've seen in that time. When Marissa and I came out for our first Games on Demand at GenCon 2011, it was just a few tables, some of which weren't even full when we dropped by late on Saturday (I think it was late on Saturday?). Just a short year later, I was so proud to be a regular GM and Host for so many people, with games ranging from constant session of Fiasco (a great starter for newbies) to new hits like Monsterhearts and Hollowpoint. There was so much going on and so many new people being exposed to this little part of our hobby that we love so much that I just felt my heart swell every time I walked into that room. I have nothing but respect for Jason, Steve, Kira, Jim, John, Terry, and everyone else who has made GoD a success. I can't for next year. (And PAX Prime!)<br/><br/>I think all the criticism and evaluation of how things went is well-placed and needed for us to grow and keep attracting awesome people to the community.

I was not really prepared for the massive uptick in size and activity from Origins, but I dove in and hopefully helped out enough to make an impact.<br/><br/>I ran a 2-hour 3:16 slot, a full 4-hour Death School slot, and 2 slots of Lady Blackbird totaling 7 hours for an enthusiastic trio of gals in their early teens who really wanted to try Story Games. I also got to play in 3 slots, so that was cool!<br/><br/>Retailer/GAMA obligations kept me from doing more, but the efforts of everyone from the full-timers to the people who stepped up to pinch-hit for single games made for an impressive success, given the madness.<br/><br/>I personally strongly prefer full slots to 2-hour games, and it sure seems like we're at a size where we can very easily support both! I heartily endorse the 2-line/2-room idea. Beyond that, a scheduled lunch and dinner break would be a huge help for morale, organization, and helping forge all the GoD GMs and hosts into one well-fed and close-knit community.<br/><br/>As a guy who's attended several JiffyCons, the big scrum of people jostling for a game at a table full of sign-up sheets has always been my least favorite part of that event (which I otherwise really like). I've not attended the other events you mention, so it may work differently there. What method do you use to determine in what order people actually sign up? If it's transferable, that would be great, but the size, scale, and time compression of this venue is definitely a barrier to any sort of more casual system.<br/><br/>Graham, what you're describing sounds perfect for a large regional Con, maybe even Origins, but GenCon has exploded out of any possibility of real intimacy that's not a private, invite-only event, I think, and I don't know where in Pax you'd hide something like that... It sure sounds fun, though.<br/><br/>So congrats and thanks, Steve, Jason, John, and Terry! Kira and I are already scheming how to keep Origins growing and gaming in its own more modest but hopefully equally engaging way. Anyone who wants to help and can make it to Columbus next June, we'd love to have your help!<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388383/#Comment_388383" name="Item_162" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T04:53:52+00:00" title="August 27, 2012  4:53AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As a guy who's attended several JiffyCons, the big scrum of people jostling for a game at a table full of sign-up sheets has always been my least favorite part of that event (which I otherwise really like).

So, if it's your first day there, we make sure your game happens.<br/><br/>What you'd usually do to enusre fairness is introduce more structure.

It was a really welcoming space: not insular, but there was a feeling of community. If you came in, you'd get slotted into a game or we'd form a new one. It was a large room, with space between tables, and it didn't have a central location.<br/><br/>It was organised informally rather than formally. It wouldn't have achieved the numbers that Jason talked about above. There was, I think, a wider variety of games and a greater emphasis on quirky ones and older ones.

These tasks include, at least:<br/><br/>- showcase indie games to as many people as possible<br/>- showcase as many different indie games as possible<br/>- showcase a wide variety of different types of indie games<br/>- sell as many copies of indie games as possible<br/>- allow people to try out games they might not otherwise get to play<br/>- playtest new games in a convention setting, with random people<br/>- bring in a new audience to indie games by hooking them with genres they already enjoy<br/>- play a bunch of really fun games with cool people<br/>- play a bunch of really fun games with old friends<br/>- play a bunch of really fun games with their designers<br/>- try out new gaming experiences that are more likely to happen in convention settings<br/>- create a sense of community and shared endeavor around indie games<br/>- have new experimental play experiences<br/>- etc.<br/><br/>Negotiating between these and hitting as many of them as possible (or as people want) seems like the responsibility of both whoever's organized Games on Demand at a particular convention and also the people there running games. Not every convention or meetup is going to hit all of them every time, and it's not surprising that people have different priorities based on their interests and what they think can be most easily done at a particular convention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388422/#Comment_388422" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T10:30:15+00:00" title="August 27, 2012 10:30AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't tell from the numbers above; how many tickets did GoD sell for GenCon?  (Is that the 969 figure or is it much higher because many of them consumed more than one two-hour slot?)<br/><br/>I ask because I was reading through the thread and I'd hear a desire for flexibility balanced against the structure imposed by GenCon's ticket/slot system.  I get that; both sides!  What about the con within a con idea that's mentioned above?  How valuable is that to GoD's operation?  And what would it take to get GenCon to sign off on that?  <br/><br/>I'm imagining something like a situation where the GoD Foundation pays GenCon up-front for the space (absorbing some of the con's risk must be a good thing and maybe worth some extra consideration from them) and then gets to operate semi-autonomously but piggyback on GenCon's infrastructure (getting reimbursed for generics collected, etc).  Does something <i>like</i> that (if not that exactly) make any sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388423/#Comment_388423" name="Item_172" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T10:37:07+00:00" title="August 27, 2012 10:37AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, we could get around the usual ticketing system by fully sponsoring a room.

I do a lot of organizing in my real life, and I don't often see this kind of energy and excitement around events. It's rare to see so many people give of their time, energy, and funds so freely, which tells me that we have a lot of really passionate and motivated people.<br/><br/>At the moment, though, there isn't really a structure that ensures that GoD stays strong over time. We have some amazing leaders, but our resources are diffuse and personal; a few key people dropping out could severely impact the organization. It's unlikely those people are going to bail, but I think it's worth noting that a GoD Foundation would have a few people who were officially in charge of safeguarding the project over time.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the organizers want to avoid the obligations that outside forces might put on the org. But I think the org already has obligations, silent and unspoken ties, that do restrain and channel our behavior already. Taking sponsorships might violate some of the neutrality and diversity that we think is central to our success, but a Kickstarter, allowing us to reach our fans, the people who are passionate as players, would really only bind the community closer together.<br/><br/>I don't want to be naive about this: I know that setting up an org and running the Kickstarter would be an enormous effort. But I think we've got some serious momentum going right now that would make all those efforts well worth it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388487/#Comment_388487" name="Item_191" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-27T19:29:03+00:00" title="August 27, 2012  7:29PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am actually pretty strongly opposed to institutionalizing GoD in a formal way.

Especially to our hosts who went to hunt down the games that were happening in other rooms and grab the tickets from GMs. And people in other rooms would know where we came from if they wandered up to that table. Thanks for making those Jason Morningstar!<br/><br/>It was really nice if you had a quieter or more serious game and wanted to get out of the loud room, or like Troll had hearing issues (at Origins I facilitated a game of Fiasco with a blind woman and the noise in the room made it a little difficult to navigate the game) to be able to have spaces nearby that one or two games could migrate to if they wanted to. I think this is fine, and solves the issue of the room being too loud for some folk. Ideally, we'd have a big enough space that it wouldn't be an issue any more, and maybe (CROSSING FINGERS) Derek and Gencon would be willing to do that for us next year.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>The other possibility that crossed my mind is a 'ribbon' type structure, where players just get a Games on Demand ribbon that lets them play whenever they want ala the Rio Grande or Mayfair rooms.</blockquote>\nThere's something in that.

We were worried there wouldn't be enough people to pull off the ribbon system at Origins, and I think Gencon has reached the critical mass to have this be a viable tool. This might be a solid plan for next year instead of just generics and scheduled tickets.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388569/#Comment_388569" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-28T08:57:40+00:00" title="August 28, 2012  8:57AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So ribbons - you buy one for $20, you play as much as you want?

And it won't be without good reason. If I paid $20 to play games, and then never get seated for a game because I didn't pay $20 AND show up an hour early, I might be upset about it. I also think the title of the 'group' Games on Demand, is unfortunately misleading, if read literally. If you are only talking about supporting a few tables, and smaller demand, this works fine, but I can't think of any way besides the way it was organized at GenCon to handle high demand and many tables. Especially when you are dealing with time slots.<br/><br/>Something like PAX, its less formal as there is no ticketing system. Somebody walks up, and sees whats going on...if there's a free GM, they can sort get that "on demand" experience. Sadly though I think I'm short on solutions and long on thinking of problems. Sorry about that.

You also have a souvenir, and a way to ID other players, creating Graham's sense of community throughout the entire show, whenever you run into someone else who also sports a ribbon. Ideally, it kills a few birds with one shiny fake-silk stone.<br/><br/>I honestly don't think it'd create any additional sense of entitlement over what we already have, where people will still get ticked if they wait in line for 20 minutes only to be told we're out of games to offer. The ribbons don't replace generics for EVERYONE, just the folks who now know that GenCon=multiple sessions of GoD instead o other ticketed events. We'd still take generics, because that's the original mission, to get new folks in.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? You can still go into the Rio Grande room if you don't have a ribbon, but if you do, you don't ever need to hand them a ticket for stuff in there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388670/#Comment_388670" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T04:25:22+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  4:25AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2012 4:25AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cam, we'd agreed to host scheduled games as a hedge against low participation.

I view collective indie endeavors like this much the way I view internet forums: when there stops being momentum and energy behind GoD, it's time will have passed and we'll organize what we do in some other way.</blockquote>\nI get this feeling, but I think that we can provide support and infrastructure without "institutionalizing" GoD. I like that the organization is flexible, that GoD is different from Pax East to GenCon to Origins, but I also think we are starting to develop a constituency of players and GMs that deserve long-term support. If eventually that community falls apart, it is as easy to abandon a formal org as it is to abandon an informal org, if you set it up correctly.<br/><br/>Games on Demand has a structure right now. It's subtle and sometimes difficult for outsiders to penetrate, but it exists. I'd like to see that structure formalized so that it's a more democratic, inclusive organization that can grow to fit the community's needs into the future. We are growing, and I think that's something to be celebrated, but I think we should plan for more growth.<br/><br/>And if that leads some people to seek new, more indie outlets for gaming, I think that would be awesome. They will be the new cutting edge of our community's growth. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388759/#Comment_388759" name="Item_218" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T17:43:09+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  5:43PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think both Jason and John hit on the positives of the scheduled games - it helped us feel more confident about being able to fill a 12 table room (although that turned out to not be a problem). It also pulled players to the room who might not otherwise have known about us- lots of attendees plan their convention by pre-purchasing seats in specific games, and they might never have looked twice at our event. Going a bit further, having a bunch of scheduled Marvel, Dungeon World, etc. took up some of the demand that might have overwhelmed the few GMs we had for those games. However, we still ran a lot of all of these scheduled games in the open slots. <br/><br/>That said, having both types of games (scheduled and open) in the room created a bit of confusion- players looking for their scheduled games standing in line when they didn't have to, not sure whether they needed to be looking for their games on the list, etc. Likewise the hosts had to keep up with the scheduled games and making sure there were tables open for them, and often we weren't sure who the GMs were or which game they belonged to (the Marvel games were listed under their scenario names, which sometimes differed from what was on the tickets). <br/><br/>We had one GM not show up for a (non-Marvel) scheduled game, and we spent a lot of time trying to find the GM (who we didn't know, or have any contact information with which to reach him) and keep the gathered players from being disappointed. We also oddly had one Marvel game where the GM was there but none of the players showed up. A little odd, but we were able to use the table, so it was no problem.<br/><br/><br/>In general, I think it's still a good idea to put games we know will be popular on the schedule, and GC events does too. I think next time we might do it in a separate space (the room next door) with clearly defined table markers and a schedule full of contact information for the GMs. Ideally those should be GMs who wouldn't otherwise be volunteering for GoD, since we'll need everyone we can get. In that respect, the scheduled Marvel games were very helpful.\n<blockquote>I personally did like having those GMs there running those games. Several people heard about GoD through these games. I would just want to use generic tickets for all the events, including these events. </blockquote>\nI don't think we can do that, actually. The whole purpose of the scheduled games is that they are in the program, and people can buy tickets to guarantee themselves a seat in the game. We'll just have to find better ways of managing both kinds of tickets.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388767/#Comment_388767" name="Item_219" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T18:59:28+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  6:59PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure how the current system works but...
