But there's nothing in the rules that really encourage that sort of thing. Might be cool to set up for a single encoutner/scenario tho, like going through a Giant Ant Lair or something.<br><br/>IIRC, though, the tactical part of Empire of Dust has a given rule, "All walls can be set on fire/destroyed". So if you drop a wall on the mat, it in fact can be blown through; a valid tactic to use. That's probably the closest game I know of that lets you do that sort of thing, because it's coded in the rules (so it's expected), and it's for a tactical battle portion of the game.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188330/#Comment_188330" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T14:25:31+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  2:25PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am not familiar with D&amp;D4;, but if I recall, in 3.x all materials have a hardness rating, which implies that they can be blown through. I think the general assumption is that unless it's a door or some such, you just don't try to blow through walls. Walls are there to guide you to the encounters you're supposed to get to. With a more free-form or sandbox adventure, with this feature emphasized, players will attempt to go through walls more often.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a matter of fact, I believe in the Eberron Campaign book, the adventure in the back takes into account the possibility that the players may try to tunnel through a wall, at a particular part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188334/#Comment_188334" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T14:30:50+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  2:30PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In 1E we used dig spells ALL the freaking time.
