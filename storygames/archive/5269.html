But if anyone has hacked Hero's Banner for another purpose, or run a successful post-apocalyptic story game I'd love your insights too.

I think it's best to start with what you've got and then see what needs to be changed. You might have done this, but I'm doing this excercise to as a form of feedback and for myself too.<br/><br/>Blood - Yeah, this doesn't really fit as Family.  I like your Society idea for post-apoc. A connection could be someone who opposes your society, or someone who is a part of it, or you want to be a part of it.<br/><br/>Conscience - This seems a big part of post-apoc. Whether or not the hard worn hero of the outlands will be able to love.<br/><br/>Hero - This could work, but I like your Self so much that I would want to replace it anyway. I wouldn't limit it to survival, but instead make it selfish. So this might be survival at the cost of others (especially your Love), but it could also be preserving something of the past or some other selfish goal which really doesn't help anyone. History is a good option, but seems too narrow as a required choice (at least it doesn't resonate with me when thinking of post-apocalyptic stories). The connection could be someone who opposes you specifically (or your selfish goal).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_118904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doplegager" title="doplegager"><img alt="doplegager" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doplegager">doplegager</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118904/#Comment_118904" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T22:33:08+00:00" title="January  9, 2008 10:33PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I picked up a copy of Hero's Banner, my first thought was to run a post apocalyptic game where the generations moved backwards instead of forwards, and the Hero category was replaced by whoever your character blamed for their current situation.  The image in my head was starting in an extreme post apocalypse where the characters were all but neolithic and their tribe has just been destroyed.  Maybe they blame the short-sightedness of the tribe elders?  Next session, they play the tribe elders, who are faced with a difficult decision because a more advanced tribe to the North is attacking.  Next session, they play characters from the Northern tribe, eventually working back through the blame game until they eventually defined what, and who, caused the apocalypse.<br/><br/>I'm digging the Society and Self categories, but I agree that History seems a bit off.  If I were playing, I'd probably be happier working History into my descriptions of my goals in the other categories, as opposed to having a category for itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118906/#Comment_118906" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-09T22:41:25+00:00" title="January  9, 2008 10:41PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the Hero influence is essential for maintaining continuity in the game.

Maybe that one explicitly <i>doesn't</i> have the option of explaining or expanding the drive? It'd almost be your self-selected "losing" condition in the game.<br/><br/>I'm not feeling History, but I like where the notion of History is coming from. In fact, I'd almost say it's part of a larger drive: <i>Continuation</i>. We have to assume our wasteland warrior isn't a total nihilist (although he might be, if "Self" wins out in the end). Continuation could include all kinds of stuff: recover bits of history for future generations, or establish a safe haven, or establish new laws and government, and so on. This is already sort of your "Society" category, just refocused a bit.<br/><br/>I really like "Conscience." That's a good (pedantically) selfish drive.<br/><br/>Maybe, because I like alliteration, your drives might be <i>Self </i>(survival, self-actualization, etc.), <i>Society </i>(growth and continuation of the greater good) and <i>Sacrifice </i>(what are you willing to die for?).<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
