I think we can all learn a lot from each other if we listen with honesty and don't attempt to tear down each other's play experiences.<br/><br/>I think the main place I've found use for social mechanics is in situations where a social roll forces a character to accept something they don't want. Where the system pushes them further into a interesting story. Using RP to flesh out two or more paths, push them hard against each other, and then DEFINITIVELY decide on one of those paths feels like something that can't be achieved through pure RP.<br/><br/>Here's an example from a Primetime Adventures game:<br/>My character Hugo, an undercover cop, is gunning to take over the gang he's infiltrating, the Flacas, from their leader Miguel. It's a total power play, attempting to dominate Miguel with everything I've got, I've got a handful of cards, and the Producer (sorta-GM) doesn't have much mojo to oppose me, so I play it totally rough. Really crowing and throwing my weight around. Then the card reveal comes.<br/><br/>I lose. Utterly. Looking at my character, his play in the game so far, my play in the scene, and the resources on the table, I should have won in a walk, and taken over the Flacas (perhaps with grudging support/continual small sabotage from Miguel). I didn't though, I lost. Hard. And I had to narrate my own defeat. Because the stakes were big, the fall was hard, and I ended up not only being utterly dominated by Miguel, but became his lover, as well. My character, as a result of losing a mechanical conflict, became <i>closer</i> to the person he was conflicting with.<br/><br/>This outcome would not have been possible if I had not been able to push so hard up to the mechanical tipping point, confident in the abilities my character had.<br/><br/>Also note that I am NOT denying the importance of roleplay in this example, just trying to establish that the effects of the system on the roleplay lead to a very different outcome than pure RP would have.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grimm" title="Grimm"><img alt="Grimm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grimm">Grimm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93798/#Comment_93798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T14:07:13+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  2:07PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the best examples of RP leading to a great many things changing through the game is my last character Talos.  It's not something that happened quickly.  It took many games of change and growth in his character, and those around him.  A slow understanding of the setting, and of a fate he would have to face alone, to close the portal keeping the undead within the demon he would have to sacrifice his soul, or that of his instructor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paladin who accomanied him seemed to continually let him down.  His boyhood dreams of the knights and their ways was quickly crashing around him as this other player ran his paladin in a way that went against everything Talos thought they should be.  His reality of what a hero was was being destroyed, and it lead to a physical fight between the two.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis part, was not player vs. player.  It was character vs. character.  Neither of us saw it comming when the tension snapped, and attacks started flying.  Our characters got away from us.  They behaved as they should.  The following question, is, ofcourse, who won?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur pissy little halfling rogue pulled the two human clergy aside and gave them a proper dressing down.  In character.  When he stiffend up and asked, ok, we can only have one leader, who's it going to be.  I looked at him and said  "You'll do."<br/>\n<br/>\nHe didn't want it.  But he took it.  Much to his, and everyone elses suprise.  My character spent several sessions resolving his idol worship, and eventually began confiding in and trusting the Paladin, with some of the dark secrets the area held.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rogue, not part of the church, grew resentful.  Eventually threatened to kill me, and left the party to figure it out on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a short synopsis of the interaction.  But none of it needed rules.  We got to edge our characters in the direction we wanted, molded by the facts at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn your example, the character you chose to play, is effectively dead.  The personality is altered, possibly in a direction you wouldn't have wanted to go, and the game you sat down to play just changed from checkers to chess.  Similar, but different.  Sometimes, that's ok, but not always.  And not for everyone.  I'd rather leave the options open, and let my players decide what's fun for them, then let leave their game to the mechanics.  Again, it's a personal taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93801/#Comment_93801" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T14:14:43+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  2:14PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aye Chris,<br><br>Thing about social interactions is that if you aren't cool with the way your character might change, you don't roll the dice.

However, unlike his battles in an earlier campaign against the Saxons, this one was won with him commanding from the rear, rather than fighting at the front. In the aftermath of the battle, Tanet, an NPC who blamed Aeron for his brother's death while against the Picts a few years earlier, confronted Aeron in front of the army. Because this was Burning Wheel, we through down in a Duel of Wits. If I won, the army would think Aeron was a coward who didn't deserve to lead them. If Keith won, the army would think Tanet was motivated solely by bad blood. Keith won, but because of the vagaries of the Duel of Wits mechanics, he had to give me a major concession. So Keith described how the army saw that Tanet was out for revenge and that Aeron was worthy of leading them, but they believed that Aeron couldn't could fight effectively in hand-to-hand combat anymore (due to a severe injury Tanet had given him in a "training accident").<br><br>What I loved about that scene was the way that the system forced us to come up with something somewhat parallel to the conflict for Aeron to give up. He did lose standing in the eyes of some of the men (since his injury wasn't actually as bad as they thought), but he accomplished his goals. That sort of compromise is something that rarely comes up in my pure RP experiences.<br><br>--Paul                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93817/#Comment_93817" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T14:45:44+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  2:45PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the thing about the character being dead.<br/><br/>This is pretty abstract.<br/><br/>I'm a guy, right?

(You've likely heard this story before, but Chris hasn't, so bear with me.) I'm playing a somewhat-disaffected drummer in a magical punk band. Judd is playing our female manager/ex-greatest fan. I'm in a scene with my girlfriend, and it's start to become obvious that things aren't right between us and I'm feeling the pressure. I go for a walk, and Judd's character shows up. Judd pretty much immediately reaches for the chips to go into a conflict to get me to break up with my girlfriend, but I stop him. "Let's keep going," I say, and we play out the rest of the conversation. By the end of it, I've decided that we don't need a conflict, as I want my character to break up with his girlfriend. Not only that, but Judd and I have what was for me the most satisfying scene of the game.<br/><br/>So, why didn't I want to go to the system? Because I didn't know if it was really a conflict. As it turns out, it wasn't. Sometimes the existence of a social conflict system will cause me to use it when I shouldn't, shortcutting what could turn out to be awesome scenes.

Like, not only do I not convince you, but I end up feeling guilty that I even asked you in the first place.<br/><br/>Of course, we could talk in-character, and judge the result of our debate based on what the characters say and what we know about human nature and such. We used to do this when we played Talislanta, and it was fun. But now, I like to give up total control and let the dice decide. We sometimes get results no one expected -- or wanted! -- when the scene began, and that's really fun.<br/><br/>I think going to the dice is about giving up total control over the outcome. If this seems natural and fun to you, it's a good fit. For many, giving up total control over the physical well-being of your character is natural and fun, whereas giving up total control over the social interactions of your character is unpleasant. That's cool. The important thing is to find where your preference lies, and then play a system that supports that preference.<br/><br/>And of course, preferences change. I used to be willing to play any kind of game system, but recently, the idea of playing a game that <i>doesn't</i> resolve social conflict with dice (or an equivalent) fills me with some dread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93866/#Comment_93866" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T16:05:32+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  4:05PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I think going to the dice is about giving up total control over the outcome.</blockquote>\nAnd the trick here is to make sure that no matter what the dice say, it will be awesome.

I remember after playing my first game of Burning Wheel, which involved several Duels of Wits but only one fight, thinking that's the kind of game I want to play.  I've played too many games where players wound up being frustrated because their character couldn't convince some other character with charm, or witty banter, or deception, simply because the other player was unwilling to be convinced (or hoodwinked or whatever).  I had this exactly happen at Dexcon, playing Unistat--at least initially.  My character was rightfully accused of deceiving the others.  I refused to confess, and the other characters refused to believe my lies.  Impasse.  But Unistat uses its conflict resolution system for all conflicts, including social conflicts.  So we rolled dice.  But we didn't roll until all the players were happy with the stakes of the roll.  Agreeing that losing the roll would change what their character's _thought_ was too much for some players, but they were willing to allow the conflict result to affect what the character did.  I've used the game as the basis for    <a href="http://virtualplay.podbus.com/" rel="nofollow">Episode 12</a> of Virtual Play.  Having the means to resolve the social conflict via mechanics was necessary to continuing that game because none of us were going to reach consensus by roleplaying.  One of us might have given in, and the game might have gone on, but the fun would have been over.    <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93904/#Comment_93904" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T18:27:55+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  6:27PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2007 6:44PM by John_Harper.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear ya, Joe.<br/><br/>For me, though, what should or would happen isn't a big concern when I play an RPG. I just want cool and fun outcomes. Changing opinions, betrayals, and reversals of faith can be cool and fun, so I want those in play. The fact that they may not be common or "realistic" is irrelevant to me. Actually, I specifically do NOT want my game system to be based on realism or most-likely outcomes. I want dramatic arcs, characters who don't always act rationally or optimally, and protagonists who change. And I like to use game mechanics to cue those results, rather than freeform play.<br/><br/>This issue of social combat also touches on matters of authority at the game table, which is really the root issue, for me. I write more about it <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4161&amp;page=2#Item_6" rel="nofollow">over here in the parent thread</a>.<br/><br/>EDIT: To summarize my comments in the other thread:<br/>In a game without social mechanics, the effectiveness of your social-manipulator character is determined solely by the fiat of your fellow players. You have no recourse in the system to achieve your character's goals. If another player says, "No, you don't convince me," then that's it. You just don't. I don't like this kind of thing when I play an RPG. When I play, I want conflicts to be resolved in a consistent manner -- without resorting to fiat -- regardless of whether they are physical, social, or some other thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93905/#Comment_93905" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T18:41:11+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  6:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't *need* mechanics for anything, <i>per se</i>, you can always freeform.

It seemed like the reason that story is about a pivotal point was that you had both come to an impasse over 30 or so sessions. I wonder if you would have let it drag out so long if you had had a mechanic to resolve the conflict ready to hand all along, thus robbing it of the impact it had in the game. It points out that not all conflicts need to be resolved in any one particular scene, but can carry forward from scene to scene without resolution, building to an ultimate showdown.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>Rolling dice when failure is uninteresting or when you cannot live with the result is teh suck.</blockquote>\nAmen!

They want to have the dice decide if the demon eats them, but not if they fall in love with the girl or become overwhelmed with passion or are wrought with doubt. But those things happen to people and are not always under conscious control. I guess its about control over your character. Its ok if something stomps them into goo, but if they want to affect their thoughts, someone better be spending spell points to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93930/#Comment_93930" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T22:05:40+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 10:05PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First off I'd like to say that I'm pretty pleased with how this thread turned out (although I'd like some more AP examples, thank you Paul and Chris and Jonathan!) I apologize for not responding to more of the content, but I wanted to hit this one point before going to bed.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite><br/>In your example, the character you chose to play, is effectively dead.  The personality is altered, possibly in a direction you wouldn't have wanted to go, and the game you sat down to play just changed from checkers to chess.  Similar, but different.  Sometimes, that's ok, but not always.  And not for everyone.  I'd rather leave the options open, and let my players decide what's fun for them, then let leave their game to the mechanics.  Again, it's a personal taste.</blockquote>\nWow, I don't see this at all in the story I wrote! How cool! What has changed that I don't want? I narrated my defeat. I set the scope of the conflict (the conversation on being able to leave certain things OFF the table in a social conflict is an important aspect). This was an important point for the character, and I had backed that up heavily through the system, which gave the Producer an idea of how to play the scene with me. I can see very little difference, in terms of outcome, between what happened to my character and what happened to Talos who went on a round-trip journey of discovery.<br/><br/>Is it that it was a rapid change? This was well into session two-of-five, and I entered the conflict in order to feel more connected to something in the fiction. The conflict was between Hugo and Miguel, both well-established characters with mutual personal history. I made a big gambit and lost, and paid the price. It thrust me into new and incredibly exciting situations, but it wasn't like I was playing a character with none of the drives or personality of the one I started the game with. Hugo ended up with a more complicated relationship to the gang he was infiltrating than he did initially. Talos boiled over, got in a fight, and ended up showing his irresponsibility, giving power to another PC. Both characters changed pretty radically, it sounds like, but Miguel reached a tipping point and fell over, whereas the Talos reached points of change through slow build-up and smaller actions across a longer time. <br/><br/>Both of these stories occured as a part of different, but still organic, processes. I haven't played a game longer than 5 sessions in years, so I doubt that I could achieve that slow build effect you got, but I think it would be difficult for you to rapidly build and resolve a transformative social conflict in a satisfying way like I did without some sort of system support. That's neither here nor there, though. Now I want to know more about how you play a dynamic character in a all-social-stuff-is-RP game.<br/><br/>BTW, I love the mutualism in your and Paul's stories, but an awful lot of it seems to happen in the character's heads. Or is it OK to say, "The way your Paladin is acting is making me lose faith in heroes" and the other person will say, "Awesome! Lets see where it takes us!" I totally love going to the system, but having more examples like these as to when to ease off and let it ride are really instructive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93934/#Comment_93934" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T23:00:12+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 11:00PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2007 11:01PM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, AP examples...my first time running Dogs a few weeks ago in preparation for running it at Gateway. Holly is one of the first up to bat with an accomplishment she wanted to get from her training at Bridal Falls temple. Her character has the trait "used to drink" so she wants to play that out and resist temptation. I think for a sec and then put her into conflict with a crate full of contraband alchohol that one of the Dogs has seized. She plays her character trying to avoid the temptation to drink, I'm playing the bottles of whiskey glinting in the lamplight and filling her nostrils with the scents she knows so well. I start with the bottles just talking, calling to her, catching her eye. She pushes the crate away from her. She notices one of the corks has come loose, she sees me with steeling herself against the pull of the bottle and stoppering the bottle. That's when the bottles escalate to physical (no new dice because this is an accomplishment conflict) a drop of whiskey is on her fingertip, so close to her mouth. In the end she had the dice to overcome the battle and put the whiskey in the cellar under lock and key, taking d6 physical fallout. We definitely could have played something like this out through conversation, but the fact that the dice were going to decide who won and which raises were BIG and which blows landed gave everything an edge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grimm" title="Grimm"><img alt="Grimm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grimm">Grimm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93974/#Comment_93974" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T07:33:23+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  7:33AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remi <br/><br/>I think it does come down to that it was a  rapid change.

My character thought the lordling prince was just as mad and playing against my piety, but the rolls led to him winning in the conflict.  I had to relent something (manpower) due to social pressure and the fear he might win without my help (eek!), but it didn't change my mind about the character, nor did it stop me from working out alliances to bolster my power should he lose or be a madman.  Had this played out without the dice, I probably never would've relented to the pressures of the society, and just booted the prince's ass out into the cold, and that would've been in character for my character, but sometimes no matter what you feel, you're backed into a corner by social forces and you've got to give in, sometimes a little, sometimes alot.  Note, that my character never changed his mind, there was absolutely zero mind control, but the pressure of the Prince's social power forced me into a corner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93996/#Comment_93996" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T09:42:29+00:00" title="September  8, 2007  9:42AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grimm</cite>Yes.

This is the cusp of things.<br/><br/>For you, a social mechanic is "rolling some dice and handling it".  It is, in essence, encountering a social situation and <i>ending it</i> with a roll of the dice.<br/><br/>For those of us who really dig the social mechanics, it's the <i>exact opposite of that experience</i>.  When the right social mechanics come into play it <i>starts something new, exciting, unexpected, and resonant</i>.  For us, the mechanic lubricates play -- it keeps it going and flowing, and prevents things from getting hung up on impasses.  <br/><br/>Man, that is just a <i>vital</i> difference in play.  If you're using your social mechanics systems to end things, then you're definitely not going to enjoy them.  I wouldn't either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94011/#Comment_94011" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T10:12:20+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 10:12AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2007 10:13AM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Like, you're a guest in someone's home and someone feeds you pancakes that are poisoned.

Saying stuff, but the dice flavoring how cutting a remark it really was and everyone reacting to the "blow" based on a combination of what was said and what the dice showed.<br/><br/>OK another AP example. This time Burning Wheel. We ran Luke Crane's con scenario at Gateway a week ago and I'm playing the Dwarf Senechal. The elves want to use elvish ettiquette while they are in the hold, we demand Dwarfish Btw: customs be followed....Duel of Wits! The verbal volleys went back and forth with me using my amazing Stentorial Debate skill and the foppish elf all charm and persuasion aided by his generation spanning knowledge. I get the upperhand and punish him severely, but then the damn elves start singing their fucking song of wonderment and I stand drooling for two volleys. The tricky elves win, but have to give a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">major</span> concession. So, its decided elvish ettiquette during the formal negotiations in the throne room, dwarvish ettiquette outside the throne room! And then, since dwarves have scene framing powers in this scenario, we immediately close the scene and frame the next scene in the dining hall three days later.

And yet, I've seen all of them in games without coercive social mechanics, so I don't inherently see any of it as a reason to favor one over the other.  I constantly see characters role-played in non-optimal, non-rational ways.  And I see protagonists who change in dramatic arcs.  And particularly when it is in the genre to do so, I see characters played in unrealistic ways.  <br/><br/>For example, the Ripper campaign was a Call of Cthulhu game where we ditched the Sanity rules and instead played through our characters crumbling sanity.

Rather, whether the character loves, and what that love means in practice, is very much found out via the application of the conflict resolution system. Is the love strong enough to stand the tempting advances of the witch? Is the character so bound by the love that he forsakes his country? We find these things out in conflict.</blockquote>\nSo, looking at it this way, if your PC is persuaded to do something that seems out of character... then clearly you didn't know him very well.

They provide another data point to use during character portrayal. If you've done improv where someone adjusts status and emotional levels you'll see the same basic mechanism. Players in both use the benchmark to guide them and can step into character portrayal more decisively. The dice say "be cooler," or "be lamer," so you have direction to chew on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only problem comes about when you get middling results, because they don't provide any direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial contests also outline the scene beforehand, but in those cases  all participants give power to the dice so no one person's being picked on.

We had two players with characters that didn't trust each other's motivations.  One wanted an encrypted computer file that had information about him, hidden behind a lot of security; the other was the one that was to get the file, but wanted to be able to verify that he's grabbing the correct file.  So we started off with freeform role-play and it became evident that the first character wasn't going to give up any personal information to the second character and that the second character wouldn't act without any personal information, this despite the second character having been stated out to be really good at negotiations and the first one not.<br/><br/>If we just let the players deal with conflicts based on which <i>player</i> was more persuasive -- or in this case, with players that wouldn't budge -- there really is no way to make the social conflict fit what the characters are about.  We went to a straight up roll using some of the social skills that are in the game and the first player had to give up something.  Even though he didn't want to, the negotiations moved to him divulging some personal information.  That happened, and the game went on.<br/><br/>If we didn't have that, we'd be at an impasse, and it would have eaten up a good chunk of time getting to that impasse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/QHudspeth" title="QHudspeth"><img alt="QHudspeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://quentinhudspeth.com/journal/wp-content/themes/atahualpa/images/H%20Logo%20super%20extra%20small.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/QHudspeth">QHudspeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94389/#Comment_94389" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T12:03:10+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 12:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Beason</cite><br/>My problem with the analogy, as I posted elsewhere, is that social interactions aren't as neat and tidy as physical ones.

Those situations aren't weighted equivalently. Changing your religious beliefs is weighted more like mortally wounding you. I've seen this imbalance quoted all over the threads here dealing with social vs physical. "Everyone" seems worried about these deep changes that should take several conflicts to resolve being wrapped up by one die roll. That would be a strange mechanic to me. But something that allowed one to nibble away at your resolve, slowly show you the "errors" of your beliefs, and finally convert you should take a long time view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94571/#Comment_94571" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T00:08:28+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 12:08AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Beason</cite>My problem with the analogy, as I posted elsewhere, is that social interactions aren't as neat and tidy as physical ones.

Or to be more accurate, the relevancy of your point depends on what the game is about. If the game features a fictional world in which the PC is essentially the player's avatar who the PC directs through interactions with that world, then you make a good point. However, if the game is about creating collaborative narrative, and the PC is a protagonist in that narrative, changing a protagonist's mind is no harder than beating the crap out of them.

Of course. Those situations aren't weighted equivalently. Changing your religious beliefs is weighted more like mortally wounding you. I've seen this imbalance quoted all over the threads here dealing with social vs physical. "Everyone" seems worried about these deep changes that should take several conflicts to resolve being wrapped up by one die roll. That would be a strange mechanic to me. But something that allowed one to nibble away at your resolve, slowly show you the "errors" of your beliefs, and finally convert you should take a long time view.</blockquote>\nThing is, the discussion here and in other threads don't point to nibbling-away mechanics, or social interactions over long periods of time.  It's the here and now.  "My character seduces yours."  "No, he doesn't."  "Roll.  Ha!"  "Well, shit."

Or to be more accurate, the relevancy of your point depends on what the game is about.

Let's use Dogs as an example, although it could be Spirit of the Century, Primetime Adventures, HeroQuest and others just as easily.<br/><br/>If you go "What's at stake is, does your character get seduced?"<br/>Then I go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.  My character doesn't swing that way. It would never happen."<br/><br/>Then a different tactic is needed. You might go, "No, see, I've got 5 bottles of wine, I'm going take advantage of you one way or another." And I could keep saying no, or I could respond, "Yikes.  Okay, I want to see how this plays out."<br/><br/>Or you might be stumped and I might say, "What are you really after with the seduction?"  And we might find out that you really want to expose your character's attraction, or instead, you want some information I have, or some object.  The key is finding what you really want.  I haven't been in a situation where what a player really wanted was completely shut down.<br/><br/>It's just like stabbing another player character in the face.  Put it that way, that sounds terrible and potentially game/friendship ending.  It's the "<i>why</i> are you stabbing me in the face?" that makes it a great story. And that's what sells other players on giving into the risk of going to dice.<br/><br/>If Brutus decided to backstab Caesar just because with his x4 multiplier gave him a good shot at killing him, it would have been an incredibly boring story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94787/#Comment_94787" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T13:24:36+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  1:24PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 1:25PM by Joe_Beason.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite><br/><br/>I mean, I'm sure we can all come up with virtual worst cases for any rule that might lead to unfun play, but that's not really an argument against rules, is that?<br/><br/></blockquote>\nIt's not virtual, it's an example from someone's sotC session, mentioned in one of the many threads that have sprunbg up around this topic.

No surprise.<br/>\n<br/>\nJD, you make a good point about conflicts potentially resolving too quickly. But two comments. There's nothing in social resolution mechanics that say that they have to be used at any given point. In fact the technique universally identified by folks is to use the mechanics when any stalemate becomes dull to continue as a stalemate, and everyone obviously wants to put stakes to resolve the issue on the board. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, there are some resolution systems that allow for just such stalemates as a result of the resolution system - either short or long term. Extended Contests from HQ is the one that comes to my mind. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs John says, however, stalemates can be bad, too, along with mediocre results. Again some of these systems have methods for dealing with this, and you can always prevent this via stakes. With most systems that I can think of, the very basic stakes are usually obtained (in HQ on a marginal victory, you get what you want, but little else - in BW duel of wits a mediocre result is getting what you want, but having to compromise... which is actually very fun). <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that these mechanics aren't perfect, but, like combat mechanics in games where those were fun, they do well enough for our purposes. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94826/#Comment_94826" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T14:56:55+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  2:56PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Beason</cite>This makes no sense.

They may force you to agree on a certain course of action (much like in real life) but they can't rewrite your Aspects (which are the core of your character). The problem here is that, since I have nothing but that quote to follow, I don't know how the situation was mechanically resolved. Nonetheless, I'm sure that in SotC there's always a way to say no, or, in a worst case scenario (a compel when your out of FP, very rare indeed) you get to say yes in your own terms.<br/><br/>So, unless lacheck agrees to come and explain his experience further, I can see two possible probable mechanics for this:<br/><br/>a) I roll my Rapport to place a Seduced aspect on you. I succeed. Then, I tag said aspect to compel you. If you accept the compel, you must act accordingly, but you get to decide how: it could mean you moon over me for a few seconds, that you will kiss me, or that you will go back to my condo with me, whatever you want. The important thing here is that I don't get to choose how you react to the compel. Or you can simply say no, pay a FP (to the GM) and be done with it.<br/><br/>b) You resolve this as a full blown social conflict. I want to seduce you, and I take you out (never accepting any concessions you offered, and paying a FP for each one I turned down). Since I win, I say you go back to my condo with me... unless you invoke the rule to demand another outcome of the conflict, at which case I have to change my statement. That being said, the limits of the conflict should be pretty clear from the beginning, so the GM may declare (quite prudently) that beyond going back to my condo, the conflict is over then and there.<br/><br/>There is also another important thing about this last option: you were trying to get something from me in the first place, or you wouldn't have agreed to use the conflict mechanics, so you agreed since the beginning that this resolution could be an option. Otherwise, you could have simply said no to the conflict.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, what happened does not seem to be consistent with the rules. The system does make sure the players are on the same page. You need to ignore some very crucial mechanics to make the situation described above happen. <br/><br/>And if you look closely at the system, since it handles the three types of conflict in the same way, if it's broken for one kind it's also broken for the others. Fortunately for those of us who play it, it's not broken.<br/><br/>I hope this helps to further advance the discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94989/#Comment_94989" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T07:02:21+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  7:02AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ren\xc3\xa9 wrote a great post that's covered large portions of my point (Why this is a "virtual" or at least "Something went wrong" case) quite nicely, so I'll just concentrate on this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe Beason</cite>It's not virtual, it's an example from someone's sotC session, mentioned in one of the many threads that have sprunbg up around this topic.

Pre-set stakes are not about walking away happy as much as they are about keeping things predictable, and establishing accountability.  You can't complain, because you agreed to the stakes.  <br/><br/>Negotiation is a good tool to manage conflicting sides of an argument, but, often, a negotiation means that neither side really walks away happy.  This technique does ensure that each player knows what they are walking into before they are hit with it, but I don't think it's a guarantee against dissatisfaction.  At best, it empowers a player to negotiate and become <i>somewhat less</i> dissatisfied, and it allows the other players to laugh off his complaints after the thing is resolved.  I don't want to be too hardline about this, though, because it is true that negotiation is less likely to leave a person feeling injustly persecuted than a one-sided decree.  I just want to show that it is by no means an infallible avenue to satisfaction.<br/><br/>Also, the same kind of theory of happiness could be applied to traditional games: if you sit down at the table, you agree to be subject to change by the die rolls.  So how can you be unhappy about something that you agreed to?<br/><br/>I liked Malcolm's point.  The rule of thumb that players should never have anything happen to them that they don't want is a little weird.  In a schoolyard game of cops and robbers, nobody ever gets shot.  If I claim to hit them, they can say "Nuh-uh".  This idea of total character ownership says that everyone should always be able to say "nuh-uh", and I don't know if I buy that.  So, an argument about whether or not SotC forces you to do certain things doesn't move me (for the record, though, I believe that SotC is actually more lenient about forcing things on the player than most games).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94992/#Comment_94992" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T07:13:59+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  7:13AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 7:23AM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>I couldn't help notice that you ignored a part of my post there: How is Seduce-lose-Unfun different from Stab-lose-Unfun and why is one ok and the other isn't?</blockquote>\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4110&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">This thread should answer that question</a>  Getting stabbed is the least sensitive area in the heirarchy of player ownership, while internal beliefs are the most sensitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94994/#Comment_94994" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T07:23:25+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  7:23AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 7:26AM by Andy.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jzn</cite>The idea that "good" social mechanics make it impossible to walk away unhappy (because you have already agreed on the stakes) doesn't pass muster.</blockquote>\nOh, I'm in 100% agreement.

A more correct statement is that stakes negotiation ameliorates the problems of player dissatisfaction enough in practice, that the problem that's cited with social mechanics causing more trouble than they're worth goes away with stakes negotiation. <br/>\n<br/>\nMalcolm, there's "unhappy" and then there's "unhappy," if you know what I mean. If you mean "dissapointed by a character's setback, such that the next victory will be that much sweeter?" Then we're all on the same page. But obviously you don't mean unhappy as in "will quit the game." Again, stakes negotiation allows you to set up acceptable failure terms. Ones that may dissapoint in the short run, but don't make the character unplayable going forward. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and as for the idea of "stakes negotiation," I actually prefer Column 2 of Fred Hicks' chart. Meaning that the negotiation doesn't actually explicitly state what the two (or more) possible end-states of resolution are, but what sort of results the players are interested in seeing in general. Such that, perhaps, a GM can create an creative result that nobody expects, but which is still in the range of desired results. <br/>\n<br/>\nSotC has a section that speaks about this. It's arguable as to whether the mechanics support this 100%, but the intent is there, FWIW. Which is to say that if SotC failed here, again, this isn't 100% effective. It probably does rely somewhat on participants using some good techniques, and not just the mechanics. If anyone wants to learn the techniques, we can certainly teach them. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95082/#Comment_95082" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T10:07:17+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 10:07AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am baffled by the idea that stakes-setting would even remotely reduce dissatisfaction in outcome.

Like playing poker for pennies.  The stakes are agreed upon, no one particularly feels the pain when they lose, and so even when you lose you need not be dissatisfied.  The point was to see who won, not how much they won, and the satisfaction comes from enjoying the process and the battle of wits.  The very small scale wagers aren't even necessary to avoid pain/dissatisfaction, so long as the participants are used to winning and losing more money.  And the same seems true of stakes setting mechanisms: they allow you to play at a level that you're comfortable with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95168/#Comment_95168" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T12:05:38+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 12:05PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, Malcolm, hence why I prefer column 2.

To that extent, setting stakes is agreeing to play poker, and not, say, Russian Roulette. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95196/#Comment_95196" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T12:58:49+00:00" title="September 12, 2007 12:58PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jzn</cite>The idea that "good" social mechanics make it impossible to walk away unhappy (because you have already agreed on the stakes) doesn't pass muster. </blockquote>\nLike Mike Holmes says, there's unhappy and there's <i>unhappy</i>. Joe was talking about a level of unhappy that was potentially game ruining, at least for the particular player continuing with that character, which is how I think this "'good' social mechanics make it impossible" entered into the discussion.<br/><br/>We're not talking about shielding players from, as JD puts it, a stabbing pain because the dice didn't turn out how they wanted.<br/><br/>Of course, like a gambler putting the deed to his house up in high stakes poker, nothing can prevent a player from betting more than they can stomach losing. But at that point, its on the player's shoulders for not keeping within the limits of what they will be <i>happy</i> with.  You can't blame social conflict rules for that, just like you can't blame the wheel or the cards.  Unlike the image of a lonely and desperate gambler, at the RPG table you've probably got other players who are going to say "Wow, are you <i>really</i> sure you want to put that on the line?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95211/#Comment_95211" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T13:35:16+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  1:35PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 1:46PM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            alvin, JD, Caesar- right, it's about accountability.  It is also is a way to make sure the DM understands what you're <i>really asking</i>, which is handy.  Although in my experience, that is usually either evident, or the player doesn't want me to know.<br/><br/>mike- I love that you brought up the lack of suspense that is a potential in stakes-setting.  I've had people tell me (in conversations about theory, not in an actual game) that suspense, surprise, and the unexpected are things that mean nothing to their roleplaying enjoyment.  The idea baffles.<br/><br/>malcolm- totally agree, again, and are thrilled that you brought in the idea of social risk as a potential positive. The idea is something implicit in all social activities, but it rarely gets talked about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ross" title="ross"><img alt="ross" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/ross_winn/pic/0000syzd"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ross">ross</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100046/#Comment_100046" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-30T16:31:39+00:00" title="September 30, 2007  4:31PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It appears that this point very much illustrated he cognitive dissonance that does not allow many gamers to make the jump to story games or indie games, as it were.

So, there's usually a safety valve for game-disrupting player narration. <br/><br/>Jeff, DitV has "describe how your character takes the blow" which might loosely fit with Ross' "enunciate the very fabric of the failure" definition. Its not exactly failure, but its player description of negative effect.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4180/successful-use-of-social-mechanics-and-rp" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4180/successful-use-of-social-mechanics-and-rp" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4180/successful-use-of-social-mechanics-and-rp/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4180%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4180%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
