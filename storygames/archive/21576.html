And, using that technique, you don\u2019t even have to use an RPG module, you can use any play or book, just assign characters, change some of them if you want. (However, even for those who do want to follow the story, part of what\u2019s cool about the GM/PC divide is surprise, exploration, and revelation, and the technique you propose can sometimes be inappropriate if it comes at too great a cost in those regards.)</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" rel="nofollow">Vivificient</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/></p><p>Related to Emma\u2019s suggestion, I recall reading of a very unique Pathfinder group that had a similar approach. Instead of everyone reading the module in advance, the DM would read the module aloud to the players at the table. Then, when they reached a combat encounter, they would set it up and play it out, players vs DM.</p>\n<p>That way, the DM didn\u2019t have to do any prep before the session, and nobody had to go through a facade of the players having to guess what they were supposed to do in order to get the correctly planned story and series of fun encounters. Always stuck with me as an interesting way to turn a kind of flawed rpg into a focused storytime/wargame combo.</p>\n<p>Of course, clearly that was for a group that wasn\u2019t interested in the roleplaying/theatrical aspect of the game.</p>\n(I wish I could find the original post where I read about that\u2026 it was somewhere on reddit but I can\u2019t think of what keywords I would use to find it now. I recall they had a slightly satirical approach, where the DM would read aloud, \u201cIf the players talk to the old man\u2026\u201d and then pause a moment, and the players would say, \u201cYep, we talk to the old man,\u201d and then the DM would continue reading.)<br/></div></blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, those who <i>are</i> willing to railroad, there are many well known techniques. And both of your suggestions do read as if they are satirically making fun of railroading which, fine, I don\u2019t like it either.</p>\n<p>But to me the obv way to railroad is to play them as intended, but with a social contract beforehand that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna play this railroaded story\u201d, and <b><i>when play inevitably strays, go meta</i></b> (maybe with a special gesture) <i><b>and tell them \u201cNo,</b></i> the module says you have to do this instead\u201d, but <em>only</em> then. As long as they do follow what the module writer intended, which some player types will do surprisingly often. After all, the modules <em>are</em> designed to subtly or overtly funnel play in a certain direction and/or designed to withstand some non-linearity.</p>\n<p>And I think I\u2019ve underestimated how malleable to non-linearity they really are. Many modules that I have seen as hopeless railroads because they contain some, in my anti-railroading brain, taboo phrase like \u201cAnd when the players then befriend to the old man\u201d. But what I\u2019ve realized lately is that if even they <em>don\u2019t</em>, maybe something cool can still happen with the stuff that\u2019s in the rest of the book. There is a DM there to adjudicate what happens if things go <em>off</em> the script, and into the sandbox. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21572/trad-rr-a-way-to-salvage-linear-modules/p1" rel="nofollow">That\u2019s why I wanted a thread on how to do that.</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471633/#Comment_471633" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-11T06:00:16+00:00" title="April 11, 2018  6:00AM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Vivificient" rel="nofollow">Vivificient</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Of course, clearly that was for a group that wasn't interested in the roleplaying/theatrical aspect of the game.</p></div></blockquote>\nWeirdly enough, the first thing that I thought of when I read this was that it was <i>perfect</i> for a more theatrically-minded group, who was interesting in exploring in-character the very specific scenes laid out in the module.

There are a lot of playstyle conventions about things like scenes with only some of the characters (and how to "break in" to a scene you're not a part of), about partitioning of in/out-of character information, etc...<br/><br/>There are games built around this kind of structure, though it might not always be implicit just from their rules that they're meant to do that (I know that his explanation was really helpful in casting light on some things I only knew as weird-sounding procedures). One way that I was often fond of conceptualizing <i>Shinobigami</i> (which I think takes a lot of influence from this playstyle) was as online freeform, but in a tabletop package; with players having heavy, rotating narrative control, a lot of freeform skills are pretty useful there, like negotiating how other people "use" your characters in their scenes, and how to share the spotlight, how to weave together multiple threads where each character is a kind of protagonist in their own story...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_471694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471694/#Comment_471694" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-11T23:46:17+00:00" title="April 11, 2018 11:46PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I found your example of the Prydain campaign really interesting, in terms of how to design a structured story.

I mean, I could write about the details of how I run it, but it's one of these new-fangled games that are fine the way they are; just do what the book says and that's how it goes. Any further points I might have make no sense whatsoever unless you know the game already.<br/><br/>As for how <i>Dead of Night</i> pertains to railroading, consider this: at the heart of the game is the scenario the GM preps, and at the heart of that scenario is a horrifying, phantasmagoric idea. A lame horror fantasy cliche like "It was werewolves all along, run for your lives!" is just about the tamest this can go (despite the gore potential); what you actually wish to craft is the scariest shit you can put to words and present cohesively at the game table.<br/><br/>So that's your railroad right there, because <i>no matter what</i>, you're going to get that stuff to the table - the play is a one-directional track towards your climatic horror reveal. Is it a certain place in the scenario's world that houses the horror? Is it a person? Is it a time and a place? A book? Whatever it is, that's where the track leads.<br/><br/>However, the rules of the game actively militate against your complete control, as the rules introduce an explicit pacing device in the Tension point tracking: is now the time for the Door to open? That door behind which is the Horror? Is it yet? No, it's not quite yet, we're still at the hinting stage. How about now? The players and the GM both have some sway over the Tension tracking, so you don't control the pace alone. You have to be ready to deconstruct your Horror, whatever it is, and present it in stages, in foreshadowing, in hinted and mediated ways. The interesting thing is that this is exactly what you need for a horror story to occur, so the game's not insane - it is doing some pretty clever things that specifically help out in presenting a horror scenario.<br/><br/>It is still, however, a railroad: the only choice the players have is whether they want to jump off the train at some point, if it should be the case that they don't want to open that door and see the Horror in its full glory after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471886/#Comment_471886" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T19:44:58+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  7:44PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Eero, thanks!<br/><br/>I haven't read or played the game, so specifics beyond what you just described might go over my head.

Depends on the fictional nature of your scenario as well - if it's a "cabin + teens + murderer" type set-up then that's different from "urban milieu, obsessed academic, horrible secrets" in terms of immediate character freedom. Some scenarios have very literal doors for characters to open if they dare, others are more metaphorical, and it may take time for the GM to set up the content.<br/><br/>The biggest variation probably comes in terms of whether your imagery works more via foreshadowing or multiple interpretative levels. For instance, a horror scenario that relies on something like "the murderer was you all along!" works with foreshadowing, so what you need to prep is foreshadowing scenes - the Tension rules will tell you in play how many of these you will ultimately need, so in practice you prep several and might end up using only some of them.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are other ideas that work less by foreshadowing and more by ambivalent implication. "Yes dear, vampires do really exist" would be a horror premise that, when brought to DoN, would work by simply prepping interactive vampire scenes - and the Tension rules would, instead of telling you when to do a setup scene and when to go to the climax, tell you what "tone" to take in describing the scene. At low tension you're all like "yeah, it must've been a rapist", while at high tension levels you're very overtly all about the fangs in the moonlight.<br/><br/>All this of course makes much more sense if you'll look at the game itself. Reading my exegesis of it in advance does <i>not</i> help grokking the rules and procedures, I would assume.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Sounds like I should play this game at some point! It's one I missed.</p></div></blockquote>\nI agree, you should. I call DoN and <i>Dread</i> the "Horror Twins" because they're basically compatible as regards scenario design. Both are excellent and they've been the state of the art for the last decade when it comes to scenario-based horror gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_471889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/471889/#Comment_471889" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-13T20:11:25+00:00" title="April 13, 2018  8:11PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
