Here's my quick recap, cross-posted to the NW Circle.<br/><br/>Myself, Johnzo, and Alan from Story Games met up at the Wayward this afternoon and played some Zombie Cinema by Eero Tuovinen.<br/><br/>I for one had a great time. It was like no zombie movie I'd ever seen--Johnzo played Mark Aaron Wiseman, charismatic leader of an apocalyptic cult, with Alan playing one of his wives, Rachel, and myself playing Walt Wallace, a security guard at the building where they ran their legit business, that made money for the cult.<br/><br/>The zombie attack took place at the aforementioned office complex, of course, with one of Mark A. Wiseman's 20+ children bringing in the zombie plague.<br/><br/>Mark didn't make it out, falling to his death from the helicopter he'd called to save him, while Rachel and Walt made it out in the chopper, after throwing out a zombified baby who'd infected the pilot.<br/><br/>Like I said, way cooler premise than any zombie movie I've seen, though things lagged a bit in the middle, and I sometimes had difficulty framing scenes.<br/><br/>After doing a little reading I discovered some rules that we weren't playing with that may have helped things along: "The director lets the characters set as much of their scene as they want, and at the end of the scene, either passes the token, or moves the zombie token should no dice rolls occur."<br/><br/>That would have made things move more quickly. We played it where the zombie token moved after all three players had directed a scene, which sometimes resulted in us quickly passing scenes because we wanted the conflict to escalate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193627/#Comment_193627" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T03:40:24+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  3:40AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Passing is a valid move in the game, players should pass when they have nothing to add to the story.<br/><br/>Where did you find that rule about moving the zombie token after a conflictless scene?

In dice rolling, we never got a tie, so the first player marker never moved; I wonder if this slows down the zombie marker? Also, I think we felt a little restricted in the middle because we each only had two other PCs to engage in conflict. A session with more players might give more leeway for first time players.<br/><br/>We also fell into narrator describing everything but the game seemed more alive when the narrator acted more like a traditional GM, adjudicating what other players declared.<br/><br/>Like the play advice said, scenes that focused only on the zombies, or sometimes just on character action without conflict, were good for building up to conflict later. I'll definitely encourage that next time. And I'll bet the rule about passing moves the zombie marker faster.<br/><br/>All in all I enjoyed the game immensely. A very successful design for such a short set of rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alan" title="Alan"><img alt="Alan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alan">Alan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193715/#Comment_193715" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T12:31:36+00:00" title="February 23, 2009 12:31PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Eero,<br/><br/>I was thinking about how it was easy for the scene framer to fall into just describing everyone's actions instead of wait for input from other players. I think this is a natural impulse because the scene framer wants to set a scene featuring his own character--so he goes straight from framing to describing his character's actions, and then keeps on going. I wonder what a game would be like if the framer could not include their own character in the scene?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193726/#Comment_193726" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-23T13:11:13+00:00" title="February 23, 2009  1:11PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Never getting ties slows the game down a little bit, but a three player game is already quite quick, so I wouldn't mind myself. Three players is more difficult due to how few protagonist characters the game has and how difficult it is to survive the story. Makes for very grim and minimalistic storytelling in my experience. Definitely playable, but not ideal for first-timers as you yourself note. 4-5 is closer to ideal for most groups.<br/><br/>As for your suggested framing limit, I tried that sort of stuff in early playtests, I seem to remember. Didn't have an outright ban, but more of a recommendation that players focus on other people's characters in their frames. Proved to be unnecessary package that did nothing, as it's the group in toto who'll determine the character focus anyway. And with many players it's actually good that players can focus on their own characters, as with a surfeit of lead characters it's often that nobody else will.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be too worried about the exact methods used by the active player in framing and adjudicating, those rules are left vague for a reason. Just use any methods that you find comfortable and functional yourself. I was never hurt by other players mixing up framing and controlling characters - easy enough to take your character back and override anything the too enthusiastic player plans out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
