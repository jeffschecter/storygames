Plus a few extra rules to help solidify how to play it.<br/><br/><b>Daemons and Drudges</b><br/><br/>You're a drudge in the service of a mighty Daemon. To describe a drudge, the crap under the sandal/hoof/whatever of a Daemon is 100 ranks higher in the supernatural pecking order than you are. Only one very menial chore is alloted you.  You\u2019ve been sent to some backwater realm from the infinite possibilities among the mutiverse to labor in said eternal service.<br/><br/>But for some unknown reason, while here you\u2019ve acquired the spark of free will.<br/><br/>Full rules: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yn3aM22MgheRniFXaWHYBl5KANSQCeRkZEPUuPa_9Dg/edit" rel="nofollow">here</a> (Google Doc)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443820/#Comment_443820" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-08T16:04:23+00:00" title="March  8, 2015  4:04PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most interesting piece to me is how (hopefully) some use of random table results will work the gears to help seed a fun session of play.  It will be even better once I have play report, but here is an example of a game setup:<br/><br/>Player 1<br/>His drudge was tasked with "to advance the cause of moisture" by the Daemon known by some as:<br/>"The Rotting Eye"<br/><br/>Player 2<br/>Her drudge was tasked with "to spread stupid questions" by the Daemon known by some as:<br/>"The Era that Lasts"<br/><br/>Player 3<br/>Her drudge was tasked with "to mime plant matter" by the Daemon known by some as:<br/>"The Envy, Steward of lonely rainments"<br/><br/>Player 4<br/>His drudge was tasked with "to haul static electricity" by the Daemon known by some as:<br/>"The Smell behind nuts"<br/><br/>Play begins in <b>The Realm of cooling frost</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
