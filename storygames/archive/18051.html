It was a huge multifaceted interactive performance event carefully balanced on the edge of semi-organized chaos. Some good photos of it can be found <a href="http://juliaotestphotography.com/all-worlds-fair" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="">here</a> with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/146140872207201/permalink/157696747718280/" rel="nofollow">short video here</a>.<br/><br/>The reason I bring this up on Story-Games.com is that a few of the Exhibits (what we called the artist rooms; each was very different) at the event used storygames as inspiration for their interactive performances. For instance, the S.O.S. (Seas Of Subconscious) exhibit consisted of a bunch of mermaids and sailors telling crazy dream stories and invited Travelers (our term for the attendees) to share their dreams which were written on paper and then slipped into small bottles to be sent off at random with other Travelers. In preparation for this before the event, the crew of S.O.S. had a couple mandatory gaming days where they played some Baron Von Munchausen to help enhance their storytelling. Also they played a hacked version of Fiasco with an ad-hoc Sailors &amp; Mermaids playset to set-up some of the relationships between them all. Another exhibit, the Cult of Emperor Norton, also had a mandatory gaming day where they played some Fiasco. They also crafted their own game that operated during the event with quests to initiate the Travelers into the Cult of Emperor Norton. Another exhibit the All Worlds Night Court used a hacked version of Sea Dracula using a "Wheel of Justice" that included such wonderful means to settle objections as "Kazoo Battle".<br/><br/>Has anyone else used storygames as inspiration/foundation for Art in this way? Whether it is for the basis of an improv performance or something more audience interactive?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407654/#Comment_407654" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T22:42:46+00:00" title="February 28, 2013 10:42PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My piano sonata, "Brave Mouse Sonata," is inspired by Mouse Guard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407656/#Comment_407656" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-28T23:35:07+00:00" title="February 28, 2013 11:35PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My piano sonata, "Brave Mouse Sonata," is inspired by Mouse Guard.</blockquote>\nAwesome!
