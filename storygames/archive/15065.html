I'm especially eager to fill this request because this is a player who has tended to not be as excited about the games, so I want to be able to give a good game to up his overall enthusiasm(also I think it would be cool). Now, I have no experience with the film-noir genre. I'm researching it so I can make the game, uh, authentic is the word I'm looking for I guess. Like I mentioned, I'm also new to the non-D&amp;D thing, so I don't really know any games that would model it well.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat games would you suggest to model the film-noir genre, and are there any tricks that you use to heighten that film-noir feeling(mechanical tricks or otherwise)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ODDin" title="ODDin"><img alt="ODDin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ODDin">ODDin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342264/#Comment_342264" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T13:48:57+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  1:48PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dirty Secrets is kinda cool but may be a bit too shocking for players who have only played D&amp;D. <br/>There's also A Dirty World, but I haven't actually read it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342299/#Comment_342299" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T16:14:06+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  4:14PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a supplement for Mortal Coil that's all about bringing the Noir into your games.

If you're running a noir game, I highly recommend it. Aside from that, if you're not familiar with film noir and want to run a game emulating it, all I can suggest is that you start by watching the classics of the genre. The Big Sleep, Double Indemnity, and Touch of Evil are essential viewing. After that, try some of: Kiss Me Deadly, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Killing, Gilda, In a Lonely Place, The Killers, This Gun for Hire, or Dark Passage. Neo noir films that captured some of the same feel include Chinatown, LA Confidential, the French Connection, the Last Seduction and (yes) Blade Runner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342318/#Comment_342318" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-11T17:59:55+00:00" title="September 11, 2011  5:59PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yes, watching some of the genre's key films was on my list of things to do, thank you very much for the suggestions; I'll start looking into those immediately.<br/>\nFrom the suggestions you guys are giving, I think A Dirty World is looking great for it, so thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, GB Steve, I'm interested in your supplement, but am thinking that, overall, I probably won't be playing Mortal Coil.

Details like a bare lightbulb and bare mattress on a floor-- can speak volumes about they way people struggle in a crowded, impoverished, heartless city.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently watched "Johnny Handsome" with Mickey Rourke, Ellen Barkin, Lance Hendriksen, Forrest Whittaker, and Morgan Freeman.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is "Eighties Noir".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 80's part: it's set in the underbelly of New Orleans, raining all the time, with women who dress like big-hair hookers, and tough guys who dress like gay hookers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Noir part: Mickey Rourke is a criminal with a monsterous deformed face and voice.  Morgan Freeman arrests him, and sends Rourke to pick cotton on a work farm.<br/>\nWhittaker is a surgeon who offers Rourke an attractive new face, on the theory that it might be the key to reforming him.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill the experiment succeed, when Rourke is back on the hopeless city streets, and back with his cronies Hendriksen and Barkin?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo create this type of Noir, you might borrow from <b>'shock: social science fiction'</b> by creating an Issues/Shock Grid.<br/>\n<br/>\nIssues: List a few social issues down the side of a page: such as Prostitution, Slumlords, Unwanted Children, Racial conflict, Substance Abuse, <b>Recidivism</b><br/>\n<br/>\nShocks: List a few iconic modern 'signs of the times' across the top of the page: such as Scientific Police Procedures, Telemarketing as a job, a winning lottery ticket, 9/11, <b>cosmetic surgery</b><br/>\n<br/>\nDraw lines down and across, so the lines intersect where each 'Issue' connects with each 'Shock'.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrainstorm about how the items would intersect, and create characters based on the intersection:  a Prostitute whose John is killed in 9/11 tries to claim she's his spouse, to get benefits.  A new tenant finds forensic evidence in an apartment, proving a slumlord killed the previous tenant. A telemarketer steals customers' identities to pay for an expensive drug habit.  Will a <b>cosmetic surgery </b> cure a <b>recidivist?</b><br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters who share a horizontal or vertical axis will be connected by the elements they have in common.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook for connections between the characters:  The telemarketer's scam is similar to the prostitute's scam. How do they meet?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also navigate the grid like a dungeon map, following the lines from intersection to intersection like a spider crossing a web, to determine story structure-- the order and content of scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342745/#Comment_342745" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T08:29:08+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  8:29AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was very helpful, and the idea about doing it with shocks(or shock-equivalents, at least) is awesome.

I think I will get your supplement though, once my Paypal is back online.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342754/#Comment_342754" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T09:25:22+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  9:25AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Film Noir: "One Can Have Her" by Jonas Ferry.

I've e-mailed Jonas about it, and am really looking forward to seeing the full version. I think I may prefer that one for a one-shot over A Dirty World, if only because it looks like I can teach it fast and it's a very simple-seeming system. If I end up doing something more substantial with the noir than that, A Dirty World looks to be the way to go. Regardless of system, I think I'm going to use that shocks/issues idea to generate some cool npcs.<br>\n<br>\nStarted watching the movies today, btw. Watched Double Indemnity, highly enjoyed it. Took a few notes during it about some cool visuals and themes/ideas to use, gonna hopefully watch another film later.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_342858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude" title="Emeraude"><img alt="Emeraude" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emeraude">Emeraude</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342858/#Comment_342858" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-14T18:35:53+00:00" title="September 14, 2011  6:35PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adding a recommendation for "A Dirty World".<br><br>Recently ran the old L5R City of Lies box with it and my players had a blast. Once everyone got a hang of the system, it really turned into a contest of mean low blows (in the good sense).<br><br>My favorite moment being, I guess, when the eta leaders - convinced that our monstrously crooked Magistrate was an honorable man - used purity to appeal to him to save their community, offering themselves up as the guilty murderers of the previous magistrate... and won him over. Faced with the first only honorable people in the whole run, he decided to let them live - and to help the eta community. Which was the beginning of the end for my players of course.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
