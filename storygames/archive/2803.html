At that time we were working on a mechanism that changed things from success to catasrophy avoidance. I refferred to it as a game where the spies could not fail. Tony chimed in and said that was one of the coolest things and that I should write that game. It was great advice except I don't know how to make that game fun. <br/><br/>With that said I was thining about 8, my game chef game, and how the same mechanism could be used for a caper game. the players roll dice like normal but they succeed at everything that doesn't involve ending the game before the fun is over. <br/><br/>For whatever reason they are inder a clock so the high die of every roll moves the clock forward and any rolll of 1 goes into the stack when the stack collapses they are on to you and things get bigger. <br/><br/>I think that I would change things so that the players would roll a number of dice and choose what they wanted to keep. that way a "better" character would get a better choice of how things went. <br/><br/>Damn you Tony LB your curse haunts me still.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63626/#Comment_63626" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-12T07:53:44+00:00" title="April 12, 2007  7:53AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still trying to find a good place to insert the "lose your cool" version of that mechanic (You never fail until you break under stress, after which things get <b>very bad</b> ... so bad rolls before that are still spectacular successes, but bring you closer to your breaking point).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should totally write that game.
