                    The other day I was reading <a href="http://rpgtalk.net/msw/weblog/163.html" rel="nofollow">Matt Wilson's Feminist Gaming Manifesto</a>, while partway through designing <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/COM/Storygame" rel="nofollow">City of Masks</a>. I was impressed by his points, and they influenced my design.<br/><br/>Now I am going to follow another of Matt's recommendations and invite some women to comment on <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/COM/Storygame" rel="nofollow">what I have done</a>, specifically in the light of the "Feminist Gaming Manifesto" blog post. (It's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> of 2; <a href="http://rpgtalk.net/msw/weblog/148.html" rel="nofollow">Part 1 is here</a> and is also relevant.)<br/><br/>Please note the purpose of this thread is for the <i>women</i> of the Story-Games community to give feedback on the game <i>in the light of the two blog posts</i>. If anyone, male or female, wants to start another thread commenting on other aspects of the game, I am very much more than happy. But I request - I can, of course, only request - that men not post to this thread. (If you read and understand the two blog posts you will probably realize why.)<br/><br/>I will set the example by not posting anything beyond this initial post here myself, unless it is to answer a direct question asked of me by one of the women. In other words, I will resist the impulse to explain, defend or justify, and try to just listen.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance, everyone.                </div>

                            Hey Mike. I just read through Matt's posts and your development stuff, and here's my CC:<br/>The first thing that stands out, from a feminist perspective, is the Temples bit.<br/><br/><i>The Priests of the Sun and Priestesses of the Moon have a deep rivalry which the Sunpriests are gradually winning. Moon worship is becoming subject to more and more restrictions, which are beginning to force it underground.</i><br/><br/>*Of course* the Sun is cast as male, and *of course* the men are winning, and *of course* the feminine Moon is being pushed out. This is old hat, overdone, and I found it a turn-off, personally. Is it possible for the life-giving Sun to be feminine, Her Acolytes, perhaps called Solars, forcing the Moon and His Lunae deeper into darkness and hiding?<br/>The servants of the Sun and Moon might not need to be so hard-line gendered: Solars and Lunae (or similar) would work as well as Priest and Priestess, and have less annoying gender edge. Also, with Masks, canâ€™t anyone be anyone, and therefore any gender? <br/><br/>In Levels:<br/>"young bloods" - I respond to that as a masculine phrase, not inclusive of adventurous young women. Try messing around with that to make it more evocative of idle youth of any gender.<br/><br/>I love the Characterist vs. Personalist idea. (edited out a sentence fragment here - MB)<br/><i>To take off oneâ€™s mask with another is an act of extreme personal intimacy, and a proper married couple, for example, would not do so.</i><br/>This sentence, on first read, looks like proper married couples don't take their masks off even with each other. I think you mean they would not be unMasked with someone other than their spouse.<br/><br/>The whole Mask thing is cool. Do people have a wardrobe of Masks to choose from in the morning? How do you gain or lose Masks? What are the occasions of same? Do children have Masks? At what age do you take your first Mask, and what ceremony is involved?<br/><br/>Gender:<br/>By saying 'gender roles are traditional' you leave yourself open to all kinds of interpretation. Traditional to now? To Venice at the comparable time? To American cira 1950? I would suggest spelling out more clearly what you mean by <br/>'traditional' and 'proper to your own gender'. If these norms are open to each group to set for themselves, similar to certain social norms in DitV, make sure that is clear, too.<br/><br/><i>[B]y masking as the opposite gender you can take actions considered proper to that gender which would not be proper to your own gender</i> - this is cool, but only helpful if I know the gender expectations. Also, the society youâ€™ve set up has clear, accepted, socially normative ways to transgress whatever gender roles exist. Therefore, in that society, thereâ€™s some understanding that these are arbitrary. The reader understands you, the author, to have as basic questions things like: â€œarenâ€™t gender roles and society roles weird and arbitrary?â€ â€œhow do we or how can we challenge and examine gender roles?â€<br/><br/>Mechanics: these look interesting. I like the interplay of cards and dominos. I think youâ€™d do better to explain that the (properly named) domino Mask of the Uncast is a simple unadorned mask covering only the eyes, as on first read, I thought of a Mask with random numbers of colored pips.<br/><br/>(Side note: As I typed this, the boys were playing dominos. Coincidence? You decide.}                        </div>

A fair reaction, and your turned-offness is noted - I'm not yet sure how to act upon it, probably by making some things clearer. For a fuller understanding of why I set things out this way you need to have read the novel, which was written before the storygame but is set some years later, when the worship of the Moon has been forced completely underground. I portray this as a Bad Thing. Effectively, the patriarchal Sun Temple has repressed both femininity and mystery (which I don't necessarily equate, but they do). This is an indirect satire on the Christian church, now that I think about it. (As someone who belongs to the Christian church I think it is particularly important that I satirize it.)<br/><br/>Anyone can be anyone - but they must play that role to the hilt. A woman who wants to do what is proper to men has to, effectively, become a man and not be detectable as a woman. This is satire also, on how women have to "become men" to succeed in a patriarchal society.                        </div>

I mean, in fact, what you thought at first read. Just as a proper Victorian married couple wouldn't take their clothes off even with each other.
<blockquote><br/>The whole Mask thing is cool. Do people have a wardrobe of Masks to choose from in the morning? How do you gain or lose Masks? What are the occasions of same? Do children have Masks? At what age do you take your first Mask, and what ceremony is involved?<br/></blockquote>
Good questions, the answers to some of which I have left vague in the setting and in my own mind. Basically, you must register any mask you wish to portray with the Keeper of the Book, who serves the Commissioners of Masks - so they know who you are.<br/><br/>You can have more than one mask if you are able to sustain more than one identity or role. The central character of the novel has three: the Envoy, which is his role in society; the Innocent Man, to protect him when he comes out with heresies because he is an ignorant foreigner; and the Gentle Knight, because he is a courageous and active man and needs an outlet for those aspects of his personality. When he is wearing any one of those masks he is considered to be that person, though there is a kind of unacknowledged doublethink going on which means that people do, in practice, understand his identity to persist between the masks. It's a little like Buddhist understandings of reincarnation: Your personality can be completely different between the different masks, yet there is some kind of essential continuity that is never really examined too closely.<br/><br/>Children are masked as Children - that is their role in society. When they come of age (at an age I haven't defined, somewhere in the teens) they can begin to take other masks as they take on other roles and aspects. I would expect there to be an associated ceremony but I haven't described it anywhere.
<blockquote><br/>Gender:<br/>By saying 'gender roles are traditional' you leave yourself open to all kinds of interpretation. Traditional to now? To Venice at the comparable time? To American cira 1950? I would suggest spelling out more clearly what you mean by<br/>'traditional' and 'proper to your own gender'. If these norms are open to each group to set for themselves, similar to certain social norms in DitV, make sure that is clear, too.<br/></blockquote>
Sorry, I meant "traditional to premodern societies, e.g. Venice in the late middle ages or early Renaissance." Now that you raise the question I realize that isn't as self-explanatory as I thought, since what was permitted to women varied considerably between different premodern times and places. Can they own property? Can they live without a man as their "protector"? Can they run businesses? And so forth. (The answer to all three of those questions is "yes" - one of the characters in the novel does all three.) I will clarify further (and perhaps leave a bit of flex for people to decide on themselves as well).
<blockquote><br/><i>[B]y masking as the opposite gender you can take actions considered proper to that gender which would not be proper to your own gender</i>- this is cool, but only helpful if I know the gender expectations. Also, the society youâ€™ve set up has clear, accepted, socially normative ways to transgress whatever gender roles exist.

The reader understands you, the author, to have as basic questions things like: â€œarenâ€™t gender roles and society roles weird and arbitrary?â€ â€œhow do we or how can we challenge and examine gender roles?â€<br/></blockquote>
Although that's not exactly a question I will answer: Yes, that's part of what I was getting at.<br/><br/>Once again, Reeves-McMillan's Third Law is proven: Fewer things are self-evident than I think. Which is why I ask for feedback. Thanks for giving some - I look forward to more from you and others.                        </div>

                            Hi Mike,<br/><br/>I've read over things as well and I also picked up on the male-sun/female-moon thing.  The sun is always considered more powerful and more important and masculine and the moon more gentle and feminine.  An immediate reaction was "how come we got stuck with the moon again!  fucking stereotypes."  I will admit that the moon in many many societies today is considered feminine and so not doing so seems odd.<br/><br/>I like how you've made a conscious effort to use inclusive/gender-neutral language.  Priest/Priestess really sticks out because of that.  "Priestess" also has a lot of baggage associated with it: not serious, vapid, deluded, prostitute.  I like Meg's suggestion of Solars/Lunae.  Another one that sticks in my mind are the Commissioners.  Commissioners in our male-dominated society have usually been men, so when I read the phrase "Commissioners of Masks" the image that comes to mind is a bunch of sterned-faced, older, powerful, priviledged men sitting at a judges' bench all dressed alike so you can't tell who is who, but all masked as men.  I don't know if there's a way to get around that, maybe provide a visual description of the Commissioners and suggest that men will dress as women, or everyone wears a gender-neutral mask so you can't tell who it is, or that Commissioners are chosen from the most powerful women and men of society.  And in that description, make sure you use "women and men" rather than "men and women" because the latter sounds like you've tacked "women" on to be PC.<br/><br/>As I was reading, I liked your parenthetical describing what a domino mask was and then read it was Meg's suggestion.  It was a great one!  I also liked your description of a female adventurer and how she could dress the part of an adventurer (shirt and pants) but have a female mask and that was acceptable.  This concept translates well into other professions, like horse wrangler where a woman needs to wear trousers but can still have a female mask because the clothes are suitable to the character's profession.<br/><br/>The idea of masks defining your gender in society is an interesting one and I can see the potential for personal conflict, especially with the Personalists (I hope I got that right).  Well done!<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

Ah, see, I was thinking I could pick it up, find it accessible, and play without reading the source material. Regardless, it's  more interesting/accessible/less off-putting now.<br/><br/>Check your 'Royal Council' assumption about "high ranking military men".<br/><br/>I like the rewrite of the cult of the Sun and the cult of the Moon - such things happen, and this is far less heavily gendered.<br/><br/>The fix for "young bloods" works great, and is more clear, IMO.<br/><br/>Great progress on the Gender piece - I now have a much better idea what you mean. And there's still plenty of room for me as a player to suggest to my group that we have XYZ gender norms.<br/><br/>Make sure your Allegiance chart matches your ideas of the Sun cult and Moon cult as those ideas shift.                        </div>

                            Not a deadline as such, no. It's a companion piece to my novel of the same name, which I'm also getting feedback about (from face-to-face friends) and will be revising over the next couple of months up to maybe the end of the year, depending on how long it takes me to learn to write "lettuce". <br/><br/>That's an in-joke, needing explanation. Apparently I have the opposite problem to most writers: I write text which is too meaty, compressing too much content into too small a space. Generally, advice for writers is "cut 10% to 25% of what you write". My first review group told me that is <i>not</i> the advice which applies to me.<br/><br/><b>Me:</b> "So I need more bread in this sandwich?"<br/><b>My friend Evelyn:</b> "More lettuce."<br/><br/>So I plan to learn how to write lettuce, expand the novel from 45,000 to maybe 60,000 words, and include the storygame in the back - thus introducing people who read the novel to storygames, and people who play storygames to my fiction. It's either marketing brilliance or marketing idiocy, time will tell.<br/><br/>Which brings up a point: You're seeing only the storygame. Some of the comments about it which have surprised me probably stem, in part, from this lack of context and might have been made differently by people who had read the novel as well. Which means I need to include more context in the storygame, at least while people are reviewing it in isolation. (There is a PDF of the novel linked from the wiki, but I don't expect you to read a 52-page, densely written PDF before you can comment; it's reasonable that I should include the full context in what I'm asking you to review.)<br/><br/>Nancy: Some societies have switched the gender assignments of sun and moon from what I am using - early Germanic and Japanese, among others, I believe. I think the majority probably associate the feminine with the moon, though (because of menstruation if for no other reason). In part, I'm intending to use our society's stereotypes to invoke conventional associations for the purpose of challenging the underlying ideas, rather than challenge the associations themselves. But if that's a stumbling block it's valuable that I know that.<br/><br/>Please bear in mind, too, that I am not describing my "ideal society" - rather the opposite. The City of Masks is intensely screwed-up, and part of that screwed-upness is what it does with gender, who is in power, and how they hold and exercise that power. I am depicting-to-critique rather than depicting-to-reinforce, but if that doesn't come through clearly, I need to know - thanks.                        </div>

Ok, this is cool, even interesting, as long as you note that, as with Victorians, it's 'socially proper', and that, as with Victorians, plenty of couples still managed. Same with bras in ancient Rome.                        </div>

                            Respectable women in ancient Rome wore a kind of strapless breast-band, to bind their breasts under the loose chitons and tunicas. Actual human breasts were highly taboo, and there are pictures of couples in all manner of undress, but that band stays -on-. In college, I read a history of prostitution that talked about how prostitutes have abided by or challenged the social norms - Roman prostitutes, by and large, kept their breasts covered.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>It is satire also, on how women have to "become men" to succeed in a patriarchal society. </blockquote>I've tested something on lots of women I've played with, since one wise one informed me of a general problem in RPGs. I ask, "Do you like playing out the struggle of women to unleash themselves from a patriarchical society?" And the answer, almost universally, is, "Not in every game I play."<br/><br/>Basically, it would seem that the "enlightened" of us males have taken to keeping the patriarchical societies, making the only interesting premise for a female character inside of the overall premise exactly what you quote above. While not specifically sexist itself, would you like it if your only choice was to either play a character opposite of your sex, or always have to play the same premise game after game after game? <br/><br/>And here's where it is sexist...there's no particular reason for the setting to be that way. Oh, sure, we're all inspired by Tolkien, and thus the societies all end up being victorian (really, not medieval, but victorian visions of the medieval world), in which the only interesting female character is? Eowyn. And her issue is? Overcoming a patriarchical blah, blah, blah...<br/><br/>It's fantasy, it shouldn't be difficult to posit egalitarian societies. So that women and other minorities playing can experience something other than this one omnipresent premise. Note that this happens with other issues as well - I've actually asked if we could skip playing out the whole cliche "Half-elf who isn't accepted by either society." It's just old. Move on to something new, and let the player decide if they want to rehash these old issues. Give them something more interesting to do. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

Two questions: <br/>Why would it be -exclusively- appropriate to women to rage against a patriarchal society? <br/>Why would one look for other premises exclusively appropriate to women? The only thing I can think of that's exclusive to women is female biology - menarche, childbirth, menopause.                        </div>

<p>Issues of pregnancy and childbirth, yeah.</p>
<p>Which are, to be fair, pretty damned large issues.</p>
<p>But the point is, you shouldn't pigeonhole female characters in your game into either rebelling against the <em>evil male oppressors</em> (and, on a more personal note: blah-city) or being boring characters.</p>
<p>There are two ways to do this.  The first is to establish egalitarian, amazonian, or otherwise fantastic societies.  The other way is to make traditional female roles more interesting than traditional male roles.</p>

                            With respect for Ben and Judson, and acknowledgeing my three sons, I disagree.<br/><br/>Motherhood is a HUGE issue, but so is fatherhood. Pregnancy and birth may be exclusively appropriate to women (although any couple trying to concieve, het or otherwise, may have strong and reasonable arguments why even that is not strictly true). Parenthood is not. <br/><br/>Ben is right on about not pigeon-holeing women, but there is a third option:<br/><br/>Consider what would be an appropriate premise for a *person* in your game or story. In Dogs, there are issues of honor, justice, and faith. When we played Polaris, it was horror, betrayal, and the fight against the death of the world. In our Capes game, there's the risk of discovery and the struggle to have a normal life. Ask me what the driving issues for my characters have been, and I'll most likely say something about trying to be a good or at least effective person in the face of temptation and challenge.                        </div>

                            My current  game (see <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19812.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19812.0</a>) is my first attempt to embed all the real-world, real-history issues of patriarchy -- in a relatively complex and nuanced way, mind. There are powerful women in the setting, for example, but their power is channeled into largely covert paths, tied to a Kali-like devouring mother goddess who embodies the earth ("from your dark womb all come, O Mother Below, and to it all return.") The sun is indeed the god of rationality, hierarchy, and patriarchy, and the moon is a goddess, but a wounded maiden figure embodying total subordination to male authority and worshipped as the patron of an order of female knights who were all either abandoned by their families as girls (in lieu of female infanticide) or after being raped (in lieu of honor killings).<br/><br/>Interstingly, Tony Lower-Basch, obviously a guy, is the person in the group who really seized on these issues -- he's playing the only female character, he defined male NPCs to be in conflict with, etc. Meanwhile the one female player has chosen a male "barbarian" type, bold and free, whose attractiveness to every female NPC in range has become both a running joke and a major driver of the plot.                        </div>

Yay Meg.<br/><br/>When you come up with "people" issues, it's probably safe to assume that, culturally, men and women will face different obstacles while dealing with those issues. It allows any player the choice to explore the various instances of patriarchy if and as they choose.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meguey</cite>Consider what would be an appropriate premise for a *person* in your game or story.</blockquote>
This is mostly what I'm getting at.  Outside of raging against the patriarchal machine, which is a premise based on the societal role of the woman in the given setting, I don't see any premises that aren't applicable to any character.  By creating the setting with that role for women, you're creating that premise for women characters.  There is the pale-to-invisible parallel premise of the man dealing with his role in a patriarchal society -- accepting his inequal rights, rejecting them, trying to balance them -- and this also arises from the societal role that women have in the setting.  It's also worthwhile to point out that you can invert this, creating a matriarchy in your setting, and get the exact opposite set of premises -- men who rage against their buttonholed positions in a matriarchy, and women who deal with the place that their society puts them.  Or you can apply this outside of gender, to any setting where one race is set above another (actual example: sidhe in Changeling).  By creating the setting, you are constraining (or at least guiding) the potential premises for play.  It's not something that you can escape.<br/><br/>You could create an egalitarian setting where there is no distinction between men and women, sure.  Or you could make some fantastic setting where there is both a patriarchy and a matriarchy available for character backgrounds, in some attempt to preserve choice.  But I think the idea of making this sort of gender-neutral setting has some pretty flawed assumptions behind it.  It's tossing the baby out with the bathwater, and it's ditching the possibility of playing that rage-against-patriarchy premise -- both sides of it and all the myriad ways that players can approach it.  It's also, to get a little abstract about things, kind of intellectually dishonest to pretend that gender issues don't touch every single aspect of life, or that there always is a nice, sensible, gender-friendly alternative to any given problem.  I'm pretty profoundly disinterested in playing an ungendered character, and erasing gender roles from a setting or making them so faint that they don't impact play seems to be an attempt to do just that.                        </div>

                            I think Josh beat me to what I was going to say, regarding 'egalitarian societies.' While it's certainly condescending to suggest in your setting material that the main thing every female character should be doing is fighting against the patriarchy, the presence of such an issue as a possibility does not automatically make it overwhelmingly important. <br/><br/>I also kind of like for my make-believe societies to have recognizeable injustices, or at least problems that parallel my own experience. Of course, this can be accomplished by having the opposite gender inequality (domineering matriarchies), but would anyone really read that as anything but a transparent analogy? It seems to me that because of the society we live in, any game with a power imbalance based on gender will automatically be "about" feminism, regardless of who is in charge. Several people in this thread have suggested that a fix in this particular case would be to have the female religion be in charge -- but I guess I'm not convinced that's really any different. It still points to the same issue.                        </div>

                            Well, since it's clear the 'no man post here' request is entirely null and void at this point, I'll add my two cents.  I'll never forget something a friend of mine said really bugged her about a certain kind of guy (not all) who played female characters: "they *act* like women"--i.e. they have this idea that women are so radically different than men that they have to act in some artificial pattern to 'be' feminine.  It was as if their thought pattern went something like "oh, well I'm playing a woman, and we all know women have a soft spot for kids (or what have you), so..." or "oh, I'm a woman in this game, therefore I should be offended that this character doesn't think of me as a fighter..."<br/><br/>To expand this out a little--what is particularly sexist in game design is to establish certain roles (with privileges or not) that simply repeat gendered stereotypes.  While it is true that there has been a long-standing, historically real set of obstacles facing women, a lot of more recent feminist scholarship has gone into showing how overstated this case has been.  That in many 'patriarchal dark ages' you find women (individually and in groups) working as agents of change in their society--and not necessarily for strictly 'feminist' (i.e. women gaining political power) agendas. <br/><br/>Which gets us back to the patriarchy question in a game--patriarchy has almost never been as powerful as certain scholars (patriarchal and otherwise) would like to believe.  Games that 'get real' by going all patriarchal are often *more metaphorical* and *more symbolic* than games that take less polar routes.  To make a game 'realistic' does not require there be some terrible oppression, nor does it require that only 'traditional' roles be allowed to women.  Even women who have embraced traditional female values have found themselves in positions of great influence throughout history.                        </div>

Amen to Joshua.<br/><br/>And to expand:<br/><br/>One of the things that struck me profoundly as I wrote up my patriarchal setting, its values, and its mythology is how much oppression of women is bad for MEN. Yes, it's obviously less bad for men, but the power of the patriarchy comes at a price, and it seem to always depend on some enforcement of gender roles that cuts men off from certain "female" aspects of their own personalities at tremendous cost -- "boys don't cry," after all.<br/><br/>If my "Shadow of Yesterday" game has a premise I can put my finger on, at this point, it's something along the lines of, "Can we ever build a society that allows us to treat each individual (including ourselves), not as a role, but as a complete human being?"                        </div>

                            In my fantasy setting, there are various race/class/cultural groups you can choose as a background, and some are more egalitarian than others.  I'm also spending time to try and make the female members of the fantasy races more interesting and (hopefully) more appealing for women gamers.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really happy with the way the Dwarven culture is developing.  Most fantasy literature simply makes female dwarves (if they're even mentioned) a duplicate of the men, often going as far as making them stout and bearded as well!  They don't seem to be a very women friendly character choice.<br/>
<br/>
In my fantasy setting, the dwarves are the most "traditional" in their assigned gender roles.  Dwarven men are stereotypically masculine traits:  Bushy Beards, Miners, Blacksmiths, Stone-workers, Warriors.  So the Dwarven women should also be stereotypical / traditional -- but still interesting and powerful.  Dwarven women have long, braided hair to match the men's beards.  Rather than being stout, they're slender and elf-like. Just like the men, they are the best at the crafts they undertake, and so it's not Elven cloaks and boots, but Dwarven cloaks and boots that are magical.  Even their cooking is of magical quality (perhaps explaining the stoutness of the men).  This suggests they would make the best alchemists / potion makers.  The dwarven men are the warriors, while the women are the spell casters.<br/>
<br/>
Very traditional gender roles, but in a fantasy context the women don't seem <i>less</i> powerful than the men.  Or at least that's the idea.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The Sylvan and Goblin races are also developing quite nicely, with very different gender roles / balances.  I'm hoping that women would actually <i>want</i> to play the females of the various fantasy races -- and not just the elves.<br/>

                            Isbo -- when I genderbend -- which I do often -- I do it for a reason.  One of the reasons that I may play a woman is to play a very feminine character, or one who has a feminist agenda.  These things are either not accessible to a character who is a man, or mean completely different things for such a character, so it needs to be a woman.  To get jargonny, I approach the decision from a narrativist bent: I want to use the character as a tool to create a compelling story, and gender choice is one of many options to help me accomplish that goal.  You seem to be arguing from a more simulationist bent: women aren't necessarily like that, or women don't all act the same -- which is all true.  However, it's pretty much irrelevant when accuracy and verisimilitude is not the goal in playing a woman.  Stereotypes are tools to be exploited in my storytelling -- by using them, challenging them, subverting them.  To that end, stereotypes can be, even should be, available to players -- there's just a big difference between "here's a stereotype, do what you will with it" and "here's a stereotype, never exceed the bounds of what is expected."<br><br>Stuart... are you assuming that female players play female characters?

Yeah, I agree with most of that. The point of the thread, though, was to check over Mike's in-progress game text for things that seemed blatant, heavy-handed, or teeth-grindingly annoying. I'm not looking for genderless play (although it'd be a cool concept for a game, perhaps - no one has a gender at the start, and the goal is to figure out what your social role is and then to determine your gender at that point), and designing a setting concious of gender roles and how they inpact play is good.<br><br>Ian - I agree about the weird tendancy of some men to play highly steryotyped women characters, with dismal results. If I played a male character to that extreme, he'd be a beer-swilling, public ball-scratching, wolf-whistling, fist-fighting ape who was interested only in sports, cars, and sex, in that order. And the point that perpetuating steryotypes is crap is good, too.<br><br>Sydney - Yeah, oppression doesn't help the oppressers very much, in the end. Everyone's just various levels of trapped by the social constraints.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<i> To get jargonny, I approach the decision from a narrativist bent: I want to use the character as a tool to create a compelling story, and gender choice is one of many options to help me accomplish that goal.</i><br><br>Well, I'll confess I'm a GNS heretic.  I don't believe in narrativism as a thing-in-itself.  It always strikes me as a particular sort of simulation, this time simulating fictional models rather than 'reality.'  But that is neither here nor there.<br><br/>What may be fair to ask is this: why is a certain female stereotype compelling story material?  That is a complex question, one that can be pretty fruitful if the player is firmly situated in the picture.  <br/><br/>Let's just for the moment imagine that the offense my friend took was unwarranted or excessive--it still may be the case that the story being told is primarily compelling to a man playing it, not to a woman observing or playing through it herself.  So that if it is a question of female-friendly game design, it is real, flesh and blood female players and their reactions that should be made front and center.<br/><br/><i>Stereotypes are tools to be exploited in my storytelling -- by using them, challenging them, subverting them. To that end, stereotypes can be, even should be, available to players -- there's just a big difference between "here's a stereotype, do what you will with it" and "here's a stereotype, never exceed the bounds of what is expected."</i><br/><br/>Yes, but some stereotypes are more productive than others.  And there's a a big difference between deliberately taking up a stereotype and being handed a stereotype.  It's the difference between going into a store and finding twenty different sizes and a dozen styles (and trying several on) and going into a store and finding one size and style (and having to wear it).  The designer of a setting is the one stocking the store, so if they want lots of people to come on in, they need to offer some diversity.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            I think there's often a lot of overlap between writing for comics and writing for RPGs, particularly in indie publishing.<br/>
<br/>
This article on writing women for comics is definitely worth reading: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.girl-wonder.org/girlsreadcomics/index.php?entry=entry060718-145925" rel="nofollow">How To Write An Original Female Lead Character In A Fashion That Doesn't Drive Karen Crazy</a><br/>
<br/>
Also worth reading (same author): <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://girl-wonder.org/girlsreadcomics/index.php?entry=entry060617-123610" rel="nofollow">This Is Not Feminism 101 (The "WTF Objectfication?!" FAQ)</a><br/>
<br/>
And whether you like Manga or not, this Comics Journal article is worth reading for publishers wanting to produce more women friendly material: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tcj.com/269/e_own1.html" rel="nofollow">She's Got Her Own Thing Now</a> </div>

                            Threadcheck - thanks, Meguey. I've been sick for a couple of days, only just got back online. <br><br>Yes, this has drifted a long way from my IP, which isn't to say it isn't interesting. Although I was hoping to avoid theoretical discussions, by men, of feminism in favour of getting concrete responses, by women, to my game which would tell me if it was needlessly offensive.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sydney Freedberg</cite><br>If my "Shadow of Yesterday" game has a premise I can put my finger on, at this point, it's something along the lines of, "Can we ever build a society that allows us to treat each individual (including ourselves), not as a role, but as a complete human being?"</br></blockquote>
And this would make a good statement of the premise of City of Masks as well.<br><br>The underlying theme of City of Masks (the novel as well as the storygame) could be said to be "role vs person" - in fact, there are two factions, the Characterists and the Personalists, who externalize and represent this conflict. Because gender is an important part of how we define ourselves, inevitably that is one of the questions which come up (not the only one or indeed necessarily the main one).<br><br/>Since you initially reviewed it, Meguey, I've added in explicit mechanics to create direct conflict between the mask and the "Hidden Face", the underlying personality of the avatar (player character). This is partly because the avatars are young people just establishing their identities, and I think we all remember as young people trying on masks that various authority figures pushed at us, and discovering who we were by the ways in which the masks didn't fit.<br/><br/>Becoming our true selves - as in the Zen challenge "Show me the face you had before you were born" - is a bit of a theme of mine, and that's really what City of Masks is all about. In the novel, people who've done remarkable things (which mark them out as someone worthy of being added to the list of Characters that other people can portray) get to wear a mask of their own face, signalling that they have portrayed themselves. There's a recent book called something like "The Woman Who Pretended To Be Who She Was" which is going along the same lines.<br/><br/>Of course, masking, acting, playing storygames and indeed reading fiction and identifying with the characters can be important ways of finding out who you are in order that you may portray yourself.<br/><br/>Sorry, I'll stop before I threadjack my own thread any more than I have already.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>
