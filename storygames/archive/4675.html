Most recently it's cropping up in response to the "new" Mongoose <a href="http://blog.mongoosepublishing.co.uk/index.php?blog=2&amp;blog=2&amp;title=traveller_personal_combat&amp;page=1&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1&amp;disp=single#c323" rel="nofollow">initiative system</a> for combat in Traveller. As in, "It looks okay, but I fear it might be too fiddly for my tastes." It seems to be a slight pejorative, along the lines of "meh".<br/><br/>1) What is your experience with this term? Have you used it? Seen it used? And, if so, in what context?<br/><br/>2) What's the underlying issue with rules described as "fiddly"? Too gimmicky? Requires rules reference in play? Too fragile/susecpetible to breaking?<br/><br/>I've never used the term myself (that I recall). Re: the Mongoose Traveller system, my concern over these kinds of "tick" systems is the need to reference the count modifiers of infrequently used actions. So, yeah, people will probably recall the basics (e.g., taking cover, firing, moving base rate, etc.) but forget or fudge the odd ones (e.g., tending to a fallen comrade's wounds, using a keypad on a locked door, etc.), which in turn ultimately discourages creative play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue" title="Rob Donoghue"><img alt="Rob Donoghue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.logrus.com/~moose/tinyhat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob%20Donoghue">Rob Donoghue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105390/#Comment_105390" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T11:51:47+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 11:51AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 29, 2007 11:54AM by Rob Donoghue.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use it as a shorthand for "It is not that this is too complicated to understand, but it has a great many moving parts/things to keep track of, probably more than I am entirely comfortable doing in play."<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>EDIT - Which is to say, it's useful because if you say something is too complicated to _use_, people will assume you are saying it's too complicated to _understand_, and the conversation that follows tends to the frustrating.<br/><br/>Additionally, something may be fiddly (have many moving parts) but not _too_ fiddly.

This is a subjective term and cannot be used as an objective measure. For instance, I consider Capes CR to be too fiddley, but many do not. But the trait shared in games that are considered fiddley is that they have mechanics that try too hard or otherwise distract you from the meat of game play.<br/>\n  In my case, I feel like Capes CR takes something awesome (what does it "cost" to be a super guy) and assigns a mechanic to it that distracts from this awesome theme. Many people to not feel that and I applaud them, but it is a concrete example of fiddley in many ways.<br/>\nDave M<br/>\nAuthor of Legends of Lanasia (Still in Beta)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Abrahm" title="Abrahm"><img alt="Abrahm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Abrahm">Abrahm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105393/#Comment_105393" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T11:56:02+00:00" title="October 29, 2007 11:56AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in the same boat as Rob.

I'd say D20 has too many fiddly bits and Spirit of the Century is smooth.  A hardcore D&amp;D fan might say that D20 is smooth and Spirit of the Century has too many.<br/><br/>It's basically a specific kind of complex.  A game might be complex just because it has a lot of rules, but all those rules might be about the same thing, so it might not be fiddly.  Its fiddly because it has too many different rules for different situations.  But the difference between "fiddly" and "just right" is all about preference and familiarity.<br/><br/>Fiddly is like "yummy" or "yucky".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105440/#Comment_105440" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T17:30:39+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  5:30PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not from the UK, but here are the sources I found on the web.

As Rob notes, this is separate from complexity. I've certainly played games that were easy to understand, but required me to do more work than I found enjoyable, or else work that seemed pointless.<br/><br/>IME, I have yet to use "fiddly" in a positive way. E.g., I wouldn't say that I wanted a game with good fiddly bits; I'd say that I wanted a game that was "robust". This makes sense to me, as what I assume is the root of the terms, "fiddling," means trivial or of little importance, to cheat, and to waste and squander. Ergo, "fiddly" is a game or game element that's wasting my time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108253/#Comment_108253" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T10:38:45+00:00" title="November 14, 2007 10:38AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

Burning Wheel is fiddly because its got lots of stars and subsystems that interact in different ways to produce different effects.  Agon is not especially fiddly because all the stats work in straightforward ways using a general dice system.  PTA is totally not fiddly because everything is resolved the same way, and choices in play have little-to-no effect on the results you get out of it.<br/><br/>Fiddly is not at all perjorative to me, as sometimes I WANT to have lots of pieces to manipulate and optimize.  Sometimes I don't.  It's roughly equivalent to sometimes wanting something sweet and sometimes wanting something savory.  Fiddly is simply descriptive for me; "too fiddly" is more a statement of preference than a judgement of quality (and is more-or-less the same as "too sweet").<br/><br/>I'm working on a fiddly game right now, and one of its features is that it's got lots of fun fiddly bits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108254/#Comment_108254" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T10:43:23+00:00" title="November 14, 2007 10:43AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<em>Addendum:</em> on further thought, it's not so much "can be fiddled with" but "must be fiddled with in order to work right."

I checked my Oxford American Dictionary, and it lists fiddly as a British informal word meaning: "complicated or detailed and awkward to do or use".<br/><br/>But Graham is also wrong in that I, per my original post, I wasn't just asking for a dictionary definition but experiences within a specified sub-culture. I know I've seen non-Brits using this word. (Indeed, this thread has pointed out some of that usage.) "Own" has a specific definition too. But, if I came here and said I'd heard gamers using the term "own" as in "I owned the guy I was playing against", it wouldn't do to simply say "own" means "to enjoy possessory rights". Is it possible we're seeing a co-opting of the British term in the game sub-culture? I think so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108719/#Comment_108719" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-18T05:18:57+00:00" title="November 18, 2007  5:18AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me the concern (as it goes) is that the British meaning of fiddly - that is, both the dictionary definition and the term in common usage across a multi-million strong linguistic community - does have a specific technical application to discussion of role-playing games. This specific community has an alternative definition - or rather, a loose pack of them, with "easily modified without breaking the game" a very different beast to "must be fiddled with to work right"; such meanings can be used in quite the same contexts as the original meaning yet convey very different things. I don't think this is true with the "owned" example. If instead, we were a community discussing slavery practises, I think this secondary use of owned would degrade the discourse.<br/><br/>My guess is that the alternative meanings of fiddly didn't exist outside of the word being introduced (likely by a Brit) with its intended meaning, but it's meaning was unclear and was therefore reinterpreted by readers. I think this is a shame, and lies at the door of the sender as much as the recipient, but believe that it is a mistake to throw up our hands and accept this muddying when good words exist to give the other sense. Leaving aside modifiable, adaptable (dictionary words), tweakable (not, but with a generally understood meaning) as close but imperfect fits, the word fiddleable (or fiddlable) yields a number of hits with pretty much exactly the meaning that is being sought - of being able to play with/modify an item in a system in order to produce the results that please you more.<br/><br/>I'm no linguist, but the -able suffix surely means "can do this to", as in timeable, stuffable, priceable <br/>whereas '-y' has different connotations, including "to an unwanted degree". Even without searching fiddleable, I knew what I was looking for, as the word has the sense of meaning what it actually does mean. Fiddly already means something different, has a clear definition, and discourse would be degraded if it took another meaning that it could easily be confused with.<br/><br/>NB: I'm reading a lot of <a href="http://karws.gso.uri.edu/JFK/History/WC_Period/Reactions_to_Warren_Report/Reactions_of_left/Bio_of_Macdonald.html" rel="nofollow">Dwight MacDonald</a> at the moment, so I know I'm outside the zeitgeist....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108779/#Comment_108779" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-18T18:06:42+00:00" title="November 18, 2007  6:06PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, "fiddly" pertains to games that contain numerous independent elements requiring concentrated oversight <i>during actual play</i> to implement in a manner that is consistent with the rules as written. Burning Wheel fits that definition for me, as does D&amp;D. Games like GURPS and HERO are much less "fiddly" for me, as much of the mechanical oversight is concentrated in the setup phase, with actual play being governed by a comparatively simple 3d6 roll under mechanic and standard-ish bookkeeping in the form of tracking health.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108926/#Comment_108926" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T22:20:43+00:00" title="November 19, 2007 10:20PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite>That's interesting, Graham.
