We had a sixth player who grafted together a new character, Alistair Pyke, who the Imperials already had locked up in the brig when the Owl's crew and hires were brought on board.<br/><br/>Interactions went well but then things got, er, interesting!<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird is a bossy authorative figure and ordered Kale about a bit, while Kale - who only takes orders from Vance, spat out a few verbal stings and barbs.<br/><br/>The situation escalated once they were out of their two jail cells. Kale nabbed a number of items from the unconscious guards (taken out by Naomi) including some Imperial Code/Message/Map tubes. Lady B turned army major type and told him to hand them over "spit spot" to her. Kale, in his flippant way deferred to Captain Vance and said "they may be rigged to explode, or to trace us where we go. I'll hand them over but she needs to know the dangers".<br/><br/>At which point, because Kale had not done her bidding, Lady B cast high magic and created a bubble around Kale and proceeded to suck out all his air for a bit. She did let him go, attempting to gloss over the situation by directing her verbals to Vance telling him to ensure his crew knew their place and that she was Noble born etc etc.<br/><br/>And then Snargle (being played as a female goblin) took umbridge to Kales punishment and jumped onto her head, acting like a spickey plastic bag, taking her air away but also giving her a small "life story". Snargle explained that she was much like Lady B and had been stripped of her position in life because of it and was now doing penance. She had a choice - play nice, or die.<br/><br/><br/>So now I await Captain Vance (having internet problems so may not post till Sunday) to react and post and Hopefully defuse the situation before Kale kills Lady B or vice versa. And also to stop that happening any time in the future of the story....<br/><br/>And so far we are still in the brig of the Hand of Sorrow....Imperials pounding down the hallway to see what the commotion is.....and the crew and hires bickering and fighting each other.<br/><br/>So we are very close to having a complete derailing of the story, with possible deaths caused by PvP.<br/><br/>Anyone else ever seen a Lady Blackbird game go south? I'm both curious to see how this turns out and also wanting a complete game reboot! lol :}<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391690/#Comment_391690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-28T16:23:21+00:00" title="September 28, 2012  4:23PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the Imperials need to break through immediately, before this gets any further.

You could even keep the characters and play the rest of the game in flashback to illustrate the series of screwed up events that lead to the clusterfuck of the opening scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vegedus" title="Vegedus"><img alt="Vegedus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/895/n84VMHBHNTJ6O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vegedus">Vegedus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392070/#Comment_392070" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T07:06:49+00:00" title="October  2, 2012  7:06AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or if that doesn't work, just end the game there. Not every game has to be half-a-year long campaign. I've run plenty of one-shots that had a structure of simmering hostility in the middle and outright PvP at the end because it's a fine way to end a game. Clear up with the players what they want: If they're fine with two explosive sessions, let them run off the rails. If they actually want to make a decent sized campaign out of it, they can probably see the reason in not outright killing each other's characters off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392101/#Comment_392101" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T11:44:53+00:00" title="October  2, 2012 11:44AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Christopher and Vegedus said.<br/><br/>I don't really see the problem here, except that you're all assuming there are meant to be rails.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392116/#Comment_392116" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-02T12:32:17+00:00" title="October  2, 2012 12:32PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The interesting thing about PvP in Lady Blackbird is that the rules don't really support it.

I was concerned about her manner right from the request to join so no hardship there if she has gone.<br/><br/><br/>BTW - tonight saw me GMing a face-to-face game of LB with my rpg group and it's been a blast.

I'm trying to play her as faithfully as the other person did, while backing down a bit to allow the game to play on.<br/><br/>Also the person playing our extra character, Alistair Pyke (who was a friend of the woman) also appears to have bailed. That's no hardship though as we can just leave him in the Brig of the Hand of Sorrow. <br/><br/>And the rest of us can play on with the rather interesting twist that now now Vance, Kale and Snargle are only doing the run for the money, and if anything happens Kale will most certainly not be worried about getting LB and Naomi out of a fix. Also, LB has (in her mind) sworn vengeance on the three of them once she's reached Uriah Heap's abode, but will play nice until then.<br/><br/>Naomi still thinks Kale is a traitor.<br/><br/>So all in all it's a pretty kettle of fish and should now provide some rather interesting roleplay!!!<br/><br/>game on! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393155/#Comment_393155" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-11T17:18:01+00:00" title="October 11, 2012  5:18PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad to hear it worked out.
