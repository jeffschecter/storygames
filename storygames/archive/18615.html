And then you start thinking of the whole movie as a game session or a campaign, and then it totally makes sense. Of course you have! You can lie to yourself but you can't lie to me!<br/><br/>Now, okay, I think you can probably do this by matching any game with any movie, but some movies just seem to fit so perfectly with certain games. I am thinking of two, specifically.<br/><br/><b>Spoiler Alert</b><br/>Yo, these are like classics from 30 years ago and I will go over plot stuff that happens in the middle and at the end. If you haven't seen these movies, you might consider checking them out, but if reading this thread spoils them for you, fuck you I'm not sorry it's your fault for reading so don't put the blame on me.<br/><br/><b><i>Apocalypse Now</i> is an old-school D&amp;D hexcrawl.</b><br/><br/>So one of the players (if this were a real game, it would be Pete) shows up with his level 4 fighter, Willard, and is like "hey DM, give me a mission." So the DM mutters some shit about how he "wanted a mission, and for my sins, they gave me one" and gives him a mission. He has the other players roll up 1st level characters. That's all the guys on the boat.<br/><br/>The DM doesn't really have much of a map going on, but he does have these really weird encounter tables that he never ended up using for the previous campaign, so he just draws a river on some hex paper and the campaign starts. He draws the bridge that marks the furthest extent of US military power, and tells Willard that he's supposed to meet the air cavalry at the mouth of the river. Everyone knows what hex that is, and how to get there.<br/><br/>And so they're off. Remember how they actually meet the air cav earlier than where they were supposed to meet them? That's because the DM rolled "air cav" on his random encounter table and decided it would make sense to be the guys they were supposed to meet. I mean, "air mobile," right? Cool, the players feel like they caught a bit of a break.<br/><br/>They then take a (different kind of) break from this adventure to play a short wargame, in which the air cavalry destroys a village. At the end of it, they insert their PCs into the chaos. If you watch the extended version of the movie, you know that they steal a surfboard and hilarity ensues. I play D&amp;D with the kind of guys who would do this, it doesn't seem like a stretch to me.<br/><br/>Then they go up the river, and there's a bit of a discrepancy between the theatrical version and the extended version of the movie. If you only watch the theatrical version, you probably think the DM placed the military base, where they pick up supplies, on the map before they started playing, and that the Playboy bunnies come from a special "army base" encounter table. If you know about all the additional footage, however, you know that the DM rolled "Playboy bunnies" more than once!<br/><br/>It very well could have gone down like this instead: The boat moves to a new hex, and the DM rolls for an encounter. He rolls "Playboy bunnies," because that's the kind of stuff he puts in his "jungle warzone encounter" tables (aka whatever random tables were lying around because he didn't have time to write an adventure before the game started), and he decides it only makes sense if there's a military base and they show up to do a show for the troops. The second time he rolls "Playboy bunnies" there's context and he says they're out of gas and stranded, and so the PCs do a little wheeling and dealing.<br/><br/>As they keep going up the river, the DM rolls up more random encounters, like hostile primitives, suspicious boats, and a French plantation. When one of the PCs wants to go foraging on land, the DM rolls "tiger," and the 1st level character does what any self-respecting 1st level PC would do in such a situation: he runs like hell. Willard, who is higher level, is not far behind him because he figures that thing can claw/claw/bite for at least 1d6/1d6/1d10 and he can only survive one of those for certain. Seeing as the tiger is the most dangerous thing they have encountered so far, they decide to "never get out of the fuckin' boat" again.<br/><br/>Finally, they get to the end, where there is a chaotic battle field and the promise of Kurtz beyond it. Willard goes to explore the battlefield map, but can't find anything that would help them. After a few encounters with semi-hostile US troops, he decides to bug out and take his chances without the advantages finding a CO could give him.<br/><br/>Then they roll up on Kurtz and find out this was maybe a poor decision. The DM makes a few rolls and finds out that Kurtz knows why Willard is there but that he also wants to die in battle. He takes Willard prisoner to make it clear that he will not tolerate any cowardly assassination attempts. The remaining two 1st level PCs then have to decide what they will do. Neither thinks they can take Kurtz and his men out unless they have backup, or Willard at the least, so one decides to do nothing (the right choice) and one decides to radio for backup (the wrong choice). One of them ends up having to fight Kurtz anyway. We don't see it on-screen, but we see the aftermath.<br/><br/>Finally Willard takes the bait and manages to get Kurtz alone. And manages to win, too. Having consumed many bags of Doritos and many bottles of Mountain Dew, the DM hands out XP to the remaining PCs (who complain vociferously about how little they get) and the game comes to an end.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418322/#Comment_418322" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-14T18:53:59+00:00" title="July 14, 2013  6:53PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 29, 2013 6:39PM by Johnstone.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> is a game of Dungeon World.</b><br/><br/>The first session of this game has only one PC, Indiana Jones. He's tromping through the jungle, hunting for treasure. The GM decides to make a few soft moves, like "the Hovitos are here. Three days, the poison is still fresh" (announcing off-screen badness), and then pulls something more dangerous: an ambush!<br/><br/>Indy gets ambushed by Barranca, one of his lackeys. Because this is Dungeon World, the GM must present the situation to the player first, he can't just start rolling damage right away. So Indy hears the revolver as Barranca pulls the hammer back. The player rolls 10+ on his Hack &amp; Slash and the gun goes flying. Barranca flees and now Indy has only one lackey, Satipo.<br/><br/>They arrive at the dungeon. The GM asks "has anyone been here before?" and Indy makes up a competitor, who died trying to raid this dungeon.<br/><br/>Inside the dungeon, Indy gets a 10+ on his Detect Traps roll. The spiders are a bit of colour, and the pit trap is obvious. His first hold tells him to "stay out of the light." His second hold finds the dart traps. That was easy! His third hold tells him there is a pressure trap underneath the idol, but he has no more hold so he doesn't know how to defeat it. He tries to defy danger anyway, and gets a 7-9. He has the idol, but the dungeon is collapsing!<br/><br/>But there's the dart trap. So Indy defies danger with DEX and gets a 7-9. Why a 7-9 you ask? Because yeah, he gets past the darts, but then he finds himself on one end of the pit trap with the idol but Satipo and the whip are on the other side. He tries to parley with Satipo, "throw me the whip!" and gets "throw me the idol, I throw you the whip" back at him. In this case, the GM had Satipo ask for a promise first, before the roll, instead of after a 7+ comes up, fully expecting a 7+ to come up. It doesn't, Indy misses the roll. So the GM tells him he throws the idol. Sorry Indy, bad judgment I guess! Satipo drops the whip and fucks off.<br/><br/>Indy defies danger to get across the pit trap, and gets a 10+. The worm turns! Being a fan of the PC, the GM decides to show Indy just how good he is: not only does he get over the pit and past the door, but he finds Satipo dead and claims the idol.<br/><br/>Note: If we want to interpret things differently, Satipo could very well be another PC, with the bond "I admire Indy very much." When he gets killed, the player just makes a new character, who is obviously Marcus Brodie. Unfortunately, he can only play for the first session, and someone else replaces him in future sessions (Marion Ravenwood).<br/><br/>Anyway, finally Indy is about to escape the dungeon, only there is one last trap: a huge boulder rolling down the passageway which is about to seal the entrance! Indy rolls to defy danger with DEX and totally misses it! The GM considers which move to make\u2014he could have Indy locked in the dungeon forever, but this is boring, so he goes with a different move. Indy makes it out in time, it's all good, he's safeBUT NO! There's Belloq with his own lackeys, and he just casually takes the idol away.<br/><br/>One last defy danger to escape while Belloq is impressing his Hovitos lackeys with the idol, and Indy makes it back to the plane and out of South America altogether.<br/><br/>GM: "What's the problem you have with Jacques?"<br/>Indy: "He has a snake in the plane. I hate snakes, Jacques! I hate 'em!"<br/><br/>Then the GM asks him what he does after he gets back and there he is, teaching at UC Berkeley I think, and he has a conversation with Marcus Brodie because he runs a museum.<br/><br/>So, having established that Indy works at a university, goes treasure-hunting on a regular basis, and has an arch-nemesis named Ren\xe9e Belloq, the GM decides to introduce a front: the Nazis (incidentally, Nazis is the best example front to use when explaining the concept of fronts). So he has two G-men show up and offer Indy a job. They don't really know what this thing that the Nazis want is, so Indy's player gets to make up the details.<br/><br/>Seriously, watch that scene again. The GM, as the two G-men, literally just spouts off some bullshit: Tanis, staff of Ra, Abner Ravenwood, your old mentor. Indy's like "we had a falling out" and then goes on to invent the Ark of the Covenant. Marcus Brodie pipes in about how the ark got to the city of Tanis and why it can't be found. Then Indy goes on to invent the headpiece of the staff of Ra. This is a good ploy, because if he can get the headpiece, this will disrupt the entire danger (Nazi occult hoarders) that the GM is concocting.<br/><br/>Okay, anyway, fast forward. second session, another player shows up, but since this is a Hollywood movie we don't see any of her adventures during the times when Indy isn't around. There's two things about the fight scene in her bar that I want to draw attention to, though:<br/><br/>One is that the GM seems to really, really like setting things on fire as a result of a 7-9 roll. When Nazidude has the hot poker, Indy rolls to disarm him but gets a 7-9, and what happens? He sets the bar on fire. Because fire = awesome, apparently.<br/><br/>Second is that during this fight the GM can see that the two PCs have bitten off a bit more than they can chew, and that this is going to go down one of two ways and it will all be over. So he has the bad guy grab the medallion, burn his hand, and run off, which means that both sides now have the info, but the nazis can have incomplete info. And so the GM can proceed with his grim portents and keep using the Nazis as a threat.<br/><br/>Later on in Cairo, Belloq has Indy cornered, but then we find out that Indy has some custom moves (that sly dog!). Or one at least:<br/><br/><b>Local Contacts</b><br/>When you <b>arrive at a new settlement</b>, roll+CHA. On a 7+, you know someone here who can help you. They count as a hireling with points according to the settlement size and will accept friendship as payment. Additionally, on a 10+, they will rescue you from danger once while you are here. On a miss, instead you bring your enemies with you and find no friends here.<br/>(cc-by-sa)<br/><br/>Marion tries to escape by getting Belloq drunk, but her parley attempt, "get drunk with me" is only a 7-9, so she has to get drunk too, and in the confusion, the bad guys show up again. Or maybe it's a miss, actually, and so her and Indy wind up in the tomb without the ark. Trapped underground, Indy uses discern realities to find the way out and it seems to work.<br/><br/>And then there's a fight scene. And a chase scene. The operating principle here seems to be something like this:<br/>Player: I rolled a partial hit, looks like.<br/>GM: Oh, I guess some shit catches on fire, then.<br/><br/>What are Indy's stats I wonder? Dexterity and Constitution must be his highest stats and it looks like he uses discern realities and hack &amp; slash a few times. He fails his parley at first, but then there's Local Contacts and his good relations with other people, which makes me think that Intelligence is his dump stat. He only ever spouts archaeological lore, which could be the GM just asking him questions, instead of the other way around, or maybe he has Bardic Lore.<br/><br/>At the end of the last session (which might still be the second one), Indy's got the rocket launcher out and he starts threatening the ark, and then the players notice what time it is and realize they have to wrap it up. Indy's player wants to blow up the ark, but the GM convinces him to let the final ritual happen and the player gives in. The GM describes the ark killing all the Nazis and then the US government files it away. Indy's player is pissed: "That's it? That's the end? I don't get to use the ark? What the fuck?" But Marion's player is like "Cool game guys, that was fun!" and it's all over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418323/#Comment_418323" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-14T19:37:26+00:00" title="July 14, 2013  7:37PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2013 7:38PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it was this movie:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58iYKU-RmU4" rel="nofollow">The Barbarians</a><br/><br/>Everything about it, just about every scene, reminds me of playing D&amp;D as a young kid (pre-teen), maybe late at night. We're trying to make up this epic fantasy, but we just keep screwing it up. Things happen, and only afterwards we realize it makes no sense. Then we probably argue and the GM gets all defensive, trying to fast-talk his or her way out of whatever thing s/he just made up, and claims it's all according to plan.<br/><br/>Plus, clearly the system is getting in the way, over and aver. The writing (and delivery of lines) reminds of a bad night of roleplaying, as well. The accents, the dialogue, the fake laughter. The NPCs have horrible, fake accents and are constantly over-acting. Meanwhile, it sounds like the PCs don't even bother trying to speak "in-character".<br/><br/>A few typical moments:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7pAlJXkFBw" rel="nofollow">Dealing with an arms merchant</a><br/><br/>Watch from 1:05. <br/><br/>An arms merchant who finds out that the tough musclebound dudes trying to buy his armoury only have a single gold coin... decides to "make them a deal". He will <i>arm-wrestle</i> the barbarians -- two big muscular dudes much bigger than him, who we have established have no money -- betting all his armour and weapons (all his goods) <i>against their gold</i>. <br/><br/>I guess the players don't realize how little sense this makes until after the game is over (the next morning, maybe!).<br/><br/>Sometimes they have trouble negotiating a sensible and coherent fiction:<br/><br/>Watch that same link (the second link above, part 5) again, but now fast-forward to 5:55 and watch to about 6:45.<br/><br/>-- "You can't get the cloaks, they're stuck under a sleeping woman."<br/>-- "OK, I roll my Strength to lift her up."<br/>-- "Fine, roll."<br/><br/>...and a bit later:<br/><br/>-- "You want to go in to the city? Okay, the guards call the alarm."<br/>-- "What? We don't look suspicious."<br/>-- "Well, you're carrying a sleeping woman above your head, that looks pretty suspicious!"<br/>-- "No, I'm not!"<br/>-- "Well, you never said that you were putting her down after you picked her up back when you were getting the cloaks."<br/>-- "Oh, fine, then. I put her down <i>first</i>, then we open the gates and go in..."<br/><br/>And so on, through the whole movie. Sometimes the GM runs out of good names, too. (The legendary magical precious stone is called... "the Ruby-stone"? Okay.)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418328/#Comment_418328" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-14T21:52:37+00:00" title="July 14, 2013  9:52PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indy teaches at Yale!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418329/#Comment_418329" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-14T21:57:30+00:00" title="July 14, 2013  9:57PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2013 10:01PM by Johnstone.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When Indy lands the ark job, he takes a plane from the central California coast to Nepal.
