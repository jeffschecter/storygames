Calculate your successes as normal. If you roll 10s, don't re-roll those dice, roll new ones. Let's say your dice pool is 5, and you roll 1, 2, 5, 7, 10. Don't say "one success" and re-roll the 10. Roll an extra die. It comes up a 9. Groovy. 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10.<br/><br/>Pass all the 1s to your GM. Set aside the 10s in front of yourself.<br/><br/>If you failed, GM gets narrative control, and is free to do bad things to you. If you succeeded, you get narrative control, and can do what you like. Note that you don't have to narrate success or failure based on what the dice say. The catch: you can only describe your outcome in its basic form: "I unlock the door" or "you fall between the roofs".<br/><br/>Now, if you succeeded, the GM can add a detail if there are any 1s on the table. One detail costs a 1. Use "yes, but" , or FANBOYS (from Houses of the Blooded) if you like. Then, if you have 10s, you can add a detail by setting aside a 10. Go back and forth, 1 die each, until all the 10s and 1s are gone. Shouldn't take too long.<br/><br/>As the player, feel free to add details that would normally be the realm of the GM in a trad game. That's the point.<br/><br/>Hooray.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221310/#Comment_221310" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T23:14:25+00:00" title="July 28, 2009 11:14PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, it's rare enough that it adds some spice, but common enough that it should happen more than once a session.

More dice = more 1s = more GM-originated twists on your actions.<br/><br/>Haven't tried it out yet, but since I am currently a narrative-control whore, I guarantee you that I will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
