You sit down with a group of perfectly nice people and within half an hour they're rolling for rape. And all this happens in a happy, joyful way. It's very strange.<br/><br/>My murder game seems to do the same for incest. Because the game contains family relationships, and the mechanics involve making them more sinister, it reliably produces incest.<br/><br/>Within an hour, perfectly nice people will be saying "Maybe he didn't just <i>tutor</i> his daughter, maybe he <i>had sex with her</i>". And, again, this happens in a happy, lighthearted way.<br/><br/>Is this, um, something I should be worried about? I'm <i>sort of</i> fine with it, since the game is about uncovering the dark secrets of a very civil family. But, well, I don't know. It does happen very often. Are there any precautions I should put in place or anything?<br/><br/>Has anyone else had similar experiences with a particular game?

If it happens too frequently it's probably because the players feel incest is the darkest secret ever. Like when people try to make their characters be more evil than others by making them rape, torture, murder small kids. It can lead to very clich\xe9d stories, but it's more of a problem of bad storytelling than anything else. I guess if the players are having fun than it shouldn't be a problem, but it would be good to at least indicate that without any depth it's little than shock value. If you want to enforce this mechanically you could limit the number of similar secrets in a story, making the players come up with different things.</p>\n<p>Damon's Hurd graphic novel "My Uncle Jeff" has a very powerful line about this, paraphrasing: "He raped my little sister. He also taught me how to love jazz". The actual phrasing is much better, but I got the distinct impression of that relative being a real human being with deep and horrible flaws but also inspiring attributes. There's usually much ambivalence in incest situations, if the players are required to create a believable situation, with all the related issues, then it would be much less frequent and much more powerful.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172622/#Comment_172622" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T10:34:07+00:00" title="October  2, 2008 10:34AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it bothers you, consider drawing a veil of genre over it. Gothic horror, murdur mystery, noir, and Cthulu fiction all have their own ways of framing the darkest secret according to their genre. Is there a way to frame your game so that taking another life is the darkest secret? What if the darkest secret is harboring incestuous desires rather than acting on them? Maybe it's worshipping dark gods.<br/><br/>Then again, maybe that approach warps your game too much, in which case you're stuck with incest smack in the middle of your fruitful void.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172641/#Comment_172641" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T11:50:24+00:00" title="October  2, 2008 11:50AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorcerer &amp; Dogs in the Vineyard reliably produce Incest for me and that's just when I'm alone sketching up the scenario as prep for GMing... wait maybe that's not something I should admit to.<br/><br/>Although, seriously, I don't think it's something you should worry about.

From previous play is that when the characters are given more definition and their own preoccupations then many more options hit the table.<br/><br/>Graham, do you recall my PC who was obsessed with maps and his plans to found a kingdom in Africa? We didn't complete that session, but I'm pretty sure that at least for my character incest wouldn't have entered into it, as the situation was ripe for conflicts and big reveals without it. If the character has hopes and needs that can be dashed (or were dashed, and now they are just covering) then this is the grist for the mill. Washed-up actors, struggling young writers with committed fianc\xe9(e)'s, taciturn generals who. Don't. Talk. About. The War. - these are ways to make the situation pregnant, so you don't have to do that to your daughter. So to speak.<br/><br/>I think incest is the default turn in the tale - and it can work surprisingly well, in many of the sessions we've played. I think it's the responsibility of the pre-murder part of the game to set up other elements that can be subverted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172696/#Comment_172696" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T16:47:24+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  4:47PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could be worse - it could be multi-level marketing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172707/#Comment_172707" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T18:53:10+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  6:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think when you're giving examples, you should include ones that involve incest.

Particularly the 7 Deadly Sins. Incest fits firmly into one category and the average player will manage to drift it into one more, probably. But then that's it.<br/><br/>So, if a new group plays your game and incest comes up, whatever. That's <i>new </i>for their group, so no problem. If they play again and incest again comes up, that's got more to do with the breadth of their imagination than your game.<br/><br/>However, what would suck is if there's this passionate fan who keeps introducing it to new groups, and incest always comes up. Because then that one fan is going to have to deal with it being in <i>every freakin' session</i>. So put a suggestion in your game that if a "dark, sinister" idea gets presented and it's tired and stale for some of the members of the group, that they should just up and say, "Yawn, that's been done. How about instead... she ate her brother and now she's revealing this to you?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172754/#Comment_172754" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T05:29:05+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  5:29AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You have degrees of darker mysteries in the game.

But once they are there, it isn't as seductive and things tend to calm down. I like offering examples to get people's creativity flowing as well as talking about incest right away to get rid of the mystique.<br/><br/>I think we also escalated too quickly in our game. The reveals should probably be a bit tamer. Otherwise, if we hit incest in the middle, people start competing for "how much more fucked up can I be", hence 13 year olds trying to rape their moms in Steve's example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172784/#Comment_172784" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T08:07:36+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  8:07AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure we've had any actual incest in the two games I've played but we've had plenty of fucked up, not that incest is far from the source material<br/><br/>'The Moving Finger'  has a brother and sister who move to the town of Lymstock only to receive a letter accusing them of incest.<br/><br/> '<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Caribbean-Mystery/Agatha-Christie/e/9781572705500" rel="nofollow">A Carribean Mystery</a>' has this quote, "Miss Marple wondered, too! And really! to have sex experience urged on you exactly as though it was an iron tonic! Poor young things... <br/><br/>"My dear Aunt Jane, why must you bury your head in the sand like a very delightful ostrich? All bound up in this idyllic rural life of yours. REAL LIFE--that's what matters."<br/><br/>Thus Raymond--and his Aunt Jane had looked properly abashed and said "Yes," she was, afraid she was rather old-fashioned.<br/><br/>Though really rural life was far from idyllic. People like Raymond were so ignorant. In, the course of her duties in a country parish, Jane Marple had acquired quite a comprehensive knowledge of the facts of rural life. She had no urge to talk about them, far less to write about them-but she knew them. Plenty of sex, natural and unnatural. Rape, incest, perversions of all kinds."<br/><br/>Generally it seems to me that the genre allows as fucked up as you like, as long as it happened in the past and can be talked about euphemistically. And murder is the outcome of such beastly behaviour. I guess you might not want to allow the characters to indulge in such horridness, keeping it in the past rather than the present.<br/><br/>Was the threat of incest and worse than the 'tag team' rape by the priest and husband of the wife? Is there even a scale on which we can judge such things? Or would even want to? I think it's a question of what the group feels comfortable with and I think discussion at the start would sort this out.<br/><br/>I think it would also be useful to have source material to show players the kinds of things characters could have done that would implicate them in the murder, perhaps on some kind of sliding scale.<br/><br/>So for example you could have: <br/>- blackmail -&gt;embezzlement -&gt;robbery -&gt;murder<br/>- slander -&gt; double-crossing -&gt; perjury -&gt;murder<br/>- slander -&gt; poison pen letters -&gt; framing -&gt; murder<br/>etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
