More or less everything about this game is designed to help you suspend your disbelief in being an adventurer in the fantasy setting of the Enshrouded Lands, where magic's hidden from ordinary folk. The game encourages a slightly actor-ish style of roleplay, with a semi-live roleplay style. Storygamers and wargamers are accommodated. The text is mainly in OpenDyslexic font.
