I thought I'd neatly organise everything according to the 6 stats - each race would have a +4 in a primary stat, +2 in a secondary stat, and -2 in a third stat. Including humans. No stat would get duplicated for any of them. So some of them ended up being similar to the classics, while others ended up a fair bit different. I also decided to organise them by height, each race 1' apart from another and take some of their physical characteristics to their extremes.<br/><br/>Dwarves are stout, they are literally as wide as they are tall, with large frames, muscle and a great deal of fat. They are also very, very hairy. All dwarves have hair covering their entire bodies, except palms and soles of their feet, with both male and female dwarves having a large mane. They are very hardy, lasting longer at physical tasks than the other races, but like dogs they ventilate by panting, making them appear constantly tired to the other races. They are also quite strong, but their size makes them slow and somewhat clumsy.<br/><br/>Elves are tall, very tall. They are very long lived, and this leads to them growing vertically, but not horizontally, and they are skinny to the point of looking frail to the other races. Most elves are bald by adulthood, and those who aren't will usually shave to avoid looking like children. Their noses are very small, having no cartilage, and their features are fine. Their pointed ears never stop growing, and while elves don't develop wrinkles in old age, an elf's age can be determined by how high above their head their points go, and how far below their chin their lobes sag. Their age affords them experience over the other races, a fact which has them looking down on them and their haughty attitude results in them being disliked. They are quite manually adept and pride themselves in their fine crafts. <br/><br/>Gnomes are slightly shorter than humans. They have very large noses, that like elves, keep growing. Their heads often go bald, and this, with their piercing eyes has them often looking like vultures - they are very genial and take jokes about this in stride. They are very intelligent, always coming up with new inventions, but their creativity gets the better of them and a "good" idea outweighs the judgement to not go through with it.<br/><br/>Halflings look like miniature humans, they're half the size in all dimensions. They are naturally weaker than the rest of the races, and must rely on their superior speed and agility to make up for it. They are also surprisingly tough for their size, only second to dwarves. Halflings have a tendency to be fearless - everyone is bigger than them, so how much bigger it is doesn't matter - they're used to being small. <br/><br/>Humans are the frailest of the races. They are more susceptible to poisons and disease and just don't last as long. They are also the shortest lived. They make up for it with superior social and diplomatic skills. They are also very quick thinkers, while not quite the geniuses gnomes are, they can out-think anyone else, and can most definitely outwit everyone else. <br/><br/>Orcs are big and strong. Not as tall as elves, and not as tall as dwarves, but they are close. They're also a bit stupid, which everyone expects given how big and strong they are, but they are very long lived, and make up for their lack of intelligence with great experience. They have wide, flat faces with large nostrils and tusks jutting out of their mouths. They lack sweat glands, and will smear mud, or whatever they can get their hands on over themselves to stay cool, contributing to their reputation for being stupid and classless. When they have a better chance to prepare they are fond of war paint. <br/><br/>As an aside, did I describe them well enough that you could guess the +4, +2 and -2 for each race?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224991/#Comment_224991" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T05:58:33+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  5:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/> Con+4, Str+2, Dex-2<br/>\nE: Wis+4, Dex+2, Car-2<br/>\nG: Int+4, Car+2, Wis-2<br/>\nHa: Dex+4, Con+2, Str-2<br/>\nHu: Car+4, Int+2, Con-2<br/>\nO: Str+4, Wis+2, Int-2<br/>\n<br/>\nI like humans being charismatic and intelligent, gives them the classic fairy tale wit to fool the giant into slitting his own belly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224993/#Comment_224993" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T06:04:57+00:00" title="August 17, 2009  6:04AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

Here's what I'd do.<br><br><b>Elf</b> An elf is a thin humanlike creature, taller than a human. The young ones have a pale greenish complexion like that of pliant wood. As they take on years (centuries, really), they harden. Their skin gets rough and changes color -- most often a dark brown but some groups of elves change to an ash color. There is a finite number of elven spirits. When one is destroyed -- a feat requiring powerful fell magic -- every elf can feel it and they meet at a secret henge to mourn together. Elves are otherwise immortal. Their spirits rest and regenerate by stepping into trees (their body goes with them, incorporeally) and sleeping there. While they sleep, they share the dreams of the tree and can learn quite a bit that way, though the memories are fleeing when they wake up. They protect trees as if they were family. When their bodies are killed, their spirits find the nearest tree and join it. After several years, they can reincarnate themselves and re-enter the world. Elves are patient, calculating, and inquisitive. Knowledge is important to them, but more important are lifelong friendships they make. They are extremely hesitant to marry or mate with mortals, however, because they know they'll outlive their loves and have to watch them die. When elves grieve, it is all-consuming for them.<br><br>Play an elf because:<br>* You want to be immortal.<br>* You want to have a close, familial tie to nature.<br>* You want access to thousands of years of world history.<br/><br/><b>Dwarf</b> Befitting their name, dwarves are short humanoids. Millennia ago, their race was conquered by an intelligent giant ant hive-race, and today the two races live in nearly perfect symbiosis in giant ant hills constructed out of mountains. Over time, the forces of magic and chaos have caused mutations that even allow the races to breed, though none likes to imagine the process, which involves royal jelly and a willing dwarf. The dwarven race consists of a few sub-races, all of which can now be properly considered "dwarf." The rarest type is the puredwarf, indistinguishable from the dwarves of eons ago. These are used for ambassadorial work, since they have no insectoid features to cause other races to recoil. However, they are often treated as inferior by other dwarves. The most common type of dwarf is the anttaur, a creature with the thorax, abdomen, and legs of a giant ant and the torso, arms, and head of a humanoid dwarf. Anttaurs also have antennae and pheromone glands for telepathic and chemical communication with other dwarves. Dwants are the other common type. They look mostly like puredwarfs except for a giant ant head. Anttaurs and Dwants compete within ant society for positions of status, but dwarf-ant culture is very hivelike and egalitarian. The competition between types is so subtle and gentle that other races barely recognize it. For example, groups of dwarves might compete for the right to be the first to explore an area or for the first pick of rooms in their giant ant-hive complex. <br/><br/>Play a dwarf because:<br/>* You want to be a weird ant-humanoid creature.<br/>* You want to be part of a hive of creatures with a common purpose.<br/>* You want to be able to talk telepathically and read pheromone trails.<br/><br/><b>Halfling</b> The halfling race is even smaller than their name suggests. The average halfling is 8 inches (20 cm) tall. However, they are extremely strong and can lift as much as a grown human. Many people have gotten into huge trouble because they underestimated a halfling! A halfling eats twice his weight in food every day. They need this energy to keep up their frantic daily pace. As long as they are eating, they never tire out or need to sleep. Halflings do things really fast! When they talk, it's a long, babbling dump of information. When they move, they run faster than the tall folk. They can even run across water and part-way up walls! Halflings often sell their services as tireless messengers. They have a love-hate relationship with small mammals. On the one hand, they love them a lot! They often domesticate rabbits and cats and dogs and ferrets as pets, mounts, and guard animals. On the other hand, in the wild, a cat or dog can be a vicious enemy.<br/><br/>Play a halfling because:<br/>* You like being really small but tough (and hungry).<br/>* You want to run everywhere, even across water and up walls.<br/>* You think the idea of riding a rabbit or cat around is really cool.<br/><br/><b>Human</b> The human race are visitors to this world. There is no nation of them. They enter the universe through portals and are changed by it. Many want to go home but a few embrace the new world and seek to unravel its mysteries. Humans are as varied as the other races because they come from so many different and strange universes (all of which seem to be magicless, or at least their magic is more myth than everyday fact). They are brown, white, black, beige, pink, yellow, red, green, and blue. They are short, tall, skinny, fat. They have bald heads, long braids, dreadlocks, curls, and short cuts. Their eyes are every shape and color. Some even have pointy ears like elves. No two humans look even vaguely alike. Every human speaks his own language and has no other friend in this world who can speak it (unless he teaches it to someone). Thus, they must learn the languages of other races and try their best to fit in. They bring into this world ideas and knowledge found nowhere else. For example, a human might know how to build war machines never seen before, or might know how to predict the future using the stars.<br/><br/>Play a human because:<br/>* You want to be a lost, otherworldly visitor to this universe.<br/>* You want to be a loner with few strong ties to cultures and peoples here.<br/>* You want to have skill or knowledge of technologies that seem magical.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225092/#Comment_225092" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T10:05:56+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 10:05AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want my elves to me more like alien Grays... black eyes, elongated features, otherworldly and ready to probe you without a second thought!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225100/#Comment_225100" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T10:14:34+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 10:14AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like pitching the D&amp;D races in terms of what you want out of your play experience.

Besides, turning things on their head isn't really re-imaging. What I did is rather than just have them have pointy ears, I went for the fact that ears continually grow, and extended it to earlobes, and put it as a marker for age. That leaves the option of having a strictly hierarchical society in elves based on age, where they view anyone with smaller ears as inferior. That brings in some aspects of the Ferengi with the elves. Having them tall gives a literal as well as metaphoric characteristic of looking down on other races, which contributes to their lower charisma.<br/><br/>Dwarves are hairy, not only do females have beards, but they have hair all over their bodies. Might as well make it fur, with coloration similar to dogs, and throw in an extra feature of panting for ventilation. It adds a bit of humour too - they're the toughest of the races with the best endurance, but outwardly they seem to be perpetually winded. It also makes it hard for them to sneak up on anyone, as they're almost constantly breathing (unless it's cold).<br/><br/>Also, since elves generally end up bald as adults, dwarves have tons of hair, so there's another reason for them to look down on dwarves. Something of a different reason for racial tensions, rather than elves being forest loving and dwarves being lumberjacks who don't care for the woods beyond what they can harvest. <br/><br/>Fat elves and skinny dwarves I'd consider to be bland an unimaginative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225459/#Comment_225459" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T12:10:30+00:00" title="August 18, 2009 12:10PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I'm just mimicking the "play this race because" bullet points in the 4E Player's Handbook. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/></blockquote>\nI gotta take a look at this thing, geez!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225482/#Comment_225482" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T13:45:34+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  1:45PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl series of books.
