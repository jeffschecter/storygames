Originally I had all interactions revolve around a single deck of playing cards, with each card serving in turn as randomizer and currency in a very constrained, very elegant, very boring package.  The game needs a level of tactical complexity that a single deck of state-tracking cards won't allow, so I need to add a companion element.  Here are the things I'm thinking of - which represents the <i>least </i>imposition on prospective pick-up players?<br/><br/><b>One deck of playing cards and tokens. </b> With this option, the tokens get turned back into cards at the game's conclusion, one for one.  The card deck serves as randomizer and then, at the end-game portion, currency.<br/><br/><b>Two decks of playing cards. </b> With this option, one deck consists of re-usable randomizers and the other consists of end-game currency.<br/><br/><b>One deck of cards and pencils.</b>  Mark down currency as it is accrued, then convert it into cards at end-game.  Honestly, I'm trying to avoid having to write anything in play, although you'll need pencils to write some stuff down during prep.<br/><br/>Is one of these more of a pain in the ass than the other?  That's all I'm asking.  They all seem sub-optimal and fiddly, but I can't do what I need to do with a single deck of cards. I'm looking for 1,2, or 3, but if 4 occurs to you, let me know.  <br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148987/#Comment_148987" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T08:41:02+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  8:41AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I like tokens.

I think Peter makes a good point that tokens or writing stuff down are both viable variants on the same technique.  I hate to change it up, because I had the game (Business Solutions) tuned to require exactly one deck of cards - each card is both a randomizer and then, once played, a resource, three players, 12 cards each, plus a possible 18 penalty cards awarded across six rounds.  Sweet and perfect, but in play not that interesting.  There needs to be more flexibility, the potential for more or less cards, more or less accrual of resources, the perception of risk, tactical decisions, all without dismantling the core game, which is very fun.  <br/><br/>Thanks again, it's what I needed to hear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149019/#Comment_149019" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T10:47:25+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 10:47AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, given the game, maybe paperclips as tokens?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149024/#Comment_149024" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T11:07:45+00:00" title="June  9, 2008 11:07AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/>\n  I don't know, I think putting cards and tokens on the table together might evoke unexpected behaviors.

The cards act as both content as counters.  A card represents both something to build (i.e. a silver mine or a library), but it also counts simply as a card.  So for example, you have a hand of five cards and you want to build a Silver Mine.  You need to have the card you want to build in your hand, but you also need to <i>discard a number of cards equal to the building cost of that card.</i>  So if the Silver Mine costs 4 cards, you will need to dump your entire hand in order to build it.  And maybe there is another cool card in your hand that you don't want to get rid of yet.  So what do you do??<br/><br/>I'm probably explaining this terribly, so I hope you get the gist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_149150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149150/#Comment_149150" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T18:11:34+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  6:11PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love games that use tokens, so I probably would vote for the first one.

It increases printing needs (or prep time if your photocopying from a book) but when you attach paperclips to the edge of the paper it makes an easy slider/indicator.<br/><br/>Don't know if this is apropos of the game, may not be. Hope it helps. <br/><br/>I would rather have counters than have to write something down myself.
