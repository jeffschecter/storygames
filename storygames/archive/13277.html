We're slowly making our way through "Prisoner #8" having a great time, and last session we had our first real combat encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the characters won a conflict against an opponent, and had 3 successes, so 3 Consequences right?<br/>\nHe decided to use 2 to gain a new positive trait for his character, and used the last Consequence to give the opponent a negative trait for that session only (giving the enemy the negative trait "Wounded" for the session).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here comes the part where I'm unsure. When the opponent decides to do something next, he probably will have to include the die for his "Wounded" trait into the dicepool (if he for instance attacks back, or tries to run away it's natural that the new trait applies to the situation).<br/>\nDoes this not mean that the player actually has given the opponent a "bonus die" by assigning him the temporary "Wounded" trait.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that there is a (small) chance of the bonus die from "Wounded" to come up as the highest die, and color the narration negatively. But in either case the opponent now has a larger chance to succeed, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it not make more sense to make the negative trail remove a die from the pool?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help to get my head around this would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nRune                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298842/#Comment_298842" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-30T14:05:54+00:00" title="October 30, 2010  2:05PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cold City V1.1 includes the optional Newman-Dempsey variant which, as you say, states that you still get a die for a negative trait but if that die comes up top, something bad happens.

Say Burrows and the conflict loser (say, Herr Schmidt) are in conflict and Burrows shoots at Schmidt:<br/><br/>If the desired or most plausible Consequence is that Schmidt is less able to function in future - e.g. shot and wounded - I'd pick -1 Action reflecting a hampering wound. If Schmidt interacts with Burrows in future he'll be less able to fight, run away, etc. but won't have any particular attitude toward Burrows forced upon him.<br/><br/>However, if Burrow's player would rather influence Schmidt's future behaviour, he might inflict the negative trait 'Scared of Cpt Burrows', perhaps the shot missing by a hair's breadth and the 'wound' psychological rahter than physical. As you say, this gives Schmidt more chance of succeeding in future conflicts with Burrows, but his player also has to roleplay accordingly - he's got to incorporate his fear of Burrows into the conflict. If it comes out as top die, sure, Schmidt's fear has a significant impact on the colour of the conflict outcome, but I reckon it's there in the mix no matter what, just to a lesser degree.<br/><br/>So Burrow's player gets to decide when he/she's assigning Consequences: reduce Schmidt's capability in future conflicts in that arena (e.g. Action-related) or influence how Schmidt's player needs to frame interactions and responses to Burrows, e.g. a more powerful (+1D) Schmidt, but one who's going to be roleplaying from a position of intimadation in relation to Burrows.<br/><br/>It's not explicit in Cold City, and that's very much my interpretation of the difference between inflicting a negative trait vs. reducing an Attribute, but hopefully it's of some help to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_298871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rune" title="Rune"><img alt="Rune" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rune">Rune</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298871/#Comment_298871" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-31T08:00:01+00:00" title="October 31, 2010  8:00AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that Adrian P<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree that this makes sense when considering the option to either reduce a attribute by one, or give the opponent a new negative trait, as both of these options cost 2 "Consequence points" if I remember correctly?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think what made me start pondering this was the 1-point option to give the opponent a temporary negative trait (the table says "for this session" the text says "for this scene" btw). It seemed to be the perfect way to give the opponent a negative trait to reflect a short term effect that had just happened (such as "wounded", "shaken", "dazed" "winded" aso), but I can't see my players using the option much if that means that the opposition will get another die to roll against them in upcoming conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I could change the name of these "1-point temporary traits" to something like "Penalty Trait" and make them give -1 die to pools instead. That way I would keep the way positive and negative traits work (including the "Newman-Dempsey variant"), and introduce "Penalty Traits" as an option to reduce the short term effectiveness of an opponent.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo instead of "Gain a negative trait for this scene only" you would have something like:<br/>\n1 point: Gain a penalty trait. A penalty trait subtracts one die from the characters pool whenever it is brought into a conflict. This trait is temporary and only last until the end of this scene/session, when it is removed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_298890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/298890/#Comment_298890" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-31T16:16:57+00:00" title="October 31, 2010  4:16PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that would work I think, and as Steve says, is really just going back to the 1st ed. rules so it has a solid precedent.
