I rarely offer anything, because I don't feel like I have much to add, but I've been slowly cooking something for a few days now. I realize this is a wall-o-text and I'm sorry. If there is a better format to present this on the forums, please just tell me and I'll correct the presentation. Thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I have this idea of how to do an fun combat sequence for what I hope to be an interesting martial arts RPG. The problem is, I don\u2019t really have much of an idea of how to do much else with it. I\u2019m not sure how to turn this system for narrating a fight scene into a full fledged game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic structure of the game, mechanically speaking, is borrowed from a game called Counter-Bluff from a book called Original Card Games by David Parlett. Players alternate playing cards, one at a time, to slowly reveal poker hands. On any turn, a player can play a card and place chips in the pot, or fold giving their opponent the win. With each card played the stakes are raised. This alternates back and forth until one player folds, or 5 cards are played and the highest hand wins the pot.<br/>\n<br/>\nEotT borrows this back and forth structure and bolts on the "Yes but..." game from improv theater. Players play cards, describe their actions (alternating back and forth and using "yes but..." to keep the action moving.) With each card play, the stakes (how much health the loser with lose) rise until one player folds or the highest poker hand wins. The winner gets to narrate a fact about their blow landing on their opponent(s) and then the action starts again with a new round. When a character is out of health they are beaten.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the basics, but I'm going to go into some detail including a play example before I get to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, characters have 3 stats:<br/>\nPassion (Hand Size: Minimum 5, feels like the maximum should be 10. Guts + 5?)<br/>\nHunger (Damage Output: Minimum 0 seems like the maximum should be 5)<br/>\nGuts (Health Minimum around 20, feels like the maximum should be 60)<br/>\n<br/>\nA character also needs two Keys that describe their style. These could, hypothetically be anything. I had just gotten back from Kung Fu Panda 2 when I was thinking about this so I was imagining Po's Keys to be Rubbery and Funny. Tigress would be Hard and Precise. Players should take some time to brainstorm some words that they associate with their style. They'll need at least 13 and maybe as many as 52.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach player takes a deck of standard playing cards and with a sharpie writes one of each of their words on each card. If you did only 13, then write the same word on all your 2's, another on your 3's, another on your 4's, etc. If you came up with 52 different ones than just go crazy. Just so each card has one word associated with it. Characters are ready to go, the smack down can now begin.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's how EotT might work:<br/>\n<br/>\nEach player gets a hand of standard playing cards equal to their Passion, and a number of chips equal to their Guts. One player leads by playing a single card from their hand and placing one of their Guts chips in-front of them, to indicate the stakes. They then narrate how their attack works, the trick is that they have to somehow use the word on the card that they played. So for instance, Player A might play the 2 of Spades with the word "rock" written on it. He might say something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>I step into a hard right cross,dropping my weight to the creaking deck of the ship. As my fist screams towards your face you feel the boat beneath us rock from the shear power of my blow...</i><br/>\n<br/>\nIt is important that a description never actually touch it's target. Player A has demonstrated how awesome his attack is, but he has paused the action right before it lands, giving player B a chance to respond.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer B can now either fold, and let Player A narrate how the blow lands, or he can play his own card, place a chip in front of him, (let's say a King of Clubs using the word "shatter") and narrate his response starting with "yes, but..."<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Yes but, I close the distance, come inside your guard drop low and come upward with a brutal uppercut that will shatter your jaw...</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point the stakes of the game are 1. The loser will take the stakes + X where X is their opponent's Hunger (Damage Output). Narrative descriptions allow players to hit their keys. If one of Player A's keys is Hard (hence the use of Rock on his card, though he used it cleverly as a verb this time) and Player B's key is Brutal (which is why he wrote Shatter on his card) the both players might hit their keys. What this means mechanically, is a little up for grabs. They might draw cards, gain Guts chips or charge thematic batteries (used for special moves?) I haven't quite worked this out yet, but let's keep going.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent Game State:<br/>\nStakes: 1<br/>\nPlayer A: 2 of Spades<br/>\nPlayer B: K of Clubs<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer A isn't ready to give in yet. He plays another card, a 2 of Clubs with the word calloused, along with another chip in front of him. Now we know he's got at least a pair (pun intended).<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Yes but I turn to the side and drop my elbow, calloused after years of driving it into bamboo training dummies, towards your exposed neck. </i><br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer B turn. He smiles across the table and with a flourish places a Queen of Clubs (and another chip) with the word feral scrawled on it onto the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Yes but I let out a feral snarl and bend like a willow under the blow. Continue the motion into a back-flip kick aimed straight to your stomach!</i><br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent Game State:<br/>\nStakes: 2<br/>\nPlayer A: One Pair (2 of Spades and Clubs)<br/>\nPlayer B: Potential Straight Flush (K, Q, of Clubs)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game would continue back and forth like that until one of the players folded, or each player had played 5 cards, in which case the highest card wins. The loser would take the Stakes + their opponent's Hunger in damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the real high level questions are these:<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can I turn this into a full fledged RPG?<br/>\nIs narrative well integrated into card play?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnpacking the first one for a moment, I think Martial Arts games are particularly difficult stories to tell. I've looked at Contenders, and Pile-drivers &amp; Power-bombs, for story structure and I think there is some really amazing stuff in there I will borrow, but they are very specific to the types of stories that they want to tell. I don't know if this is a game that involves a tournament, though it might.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anyone have a good source of the story-beats of a martial arts stories?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if we assume that the combat will resolve around pairs of fighters than that really leaves other players at a loss for anything to contribute. I've tried to keep them involved by handing out the rewards for hitting their keys, but that is only so interesting. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to overcome this issue?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the second of the high level questions, does anyone have any ideas on how to better integrate narrative into card play. Do you think it's enough to have the narrative trigger on the card? Do you think it's a good idea to limit narrative options mechanically somehow:<br/>\n<br/>\nAdding tags to character sheets (props, environment, weapons, chakras, fireballs, insult) and every time a player used these concepts crossing them off to encourage creativity and gain mechanical benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually creating specific moves (Do Violence, Keep Safe, Turn it Back on Them, etc.) and tying them to cards, tags, suits, to make players only able to do specific narrative actions with specific card plays.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving players tie specific narrative facts to actions or "special moves" (Throws opponent to the ground, deadens the nerves in the left arm, shatters their femur, Causes a horible poison to enter the target's blood slowly killing them over weeks, Curses their soul to be tortured by the the violence of their guilty conscience in hell). Is there some way to limit/control/integrate this sort of thing mechanically?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it necessary? Is narration well integrated into card play enough or is something more necessary?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd appreciate any help you can offer, and thank you kindly for reading all of this rambling.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331142/#Comment_331142" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-22T07:21:02+00:00" title="June 22, 2011  7:21AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome to posting.<br><br>I like the way this makes the fight seem to escalate and I think this would really suit martial arts action.<br><br>As you say it is more of a mechanic than a roleplaying game right now, and it only suits two player combats.<br><br>Very interesting, but I might need to think about this a bit more and come back to it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dgreen1220" title="Dgreen1220"><img alt="Dgreen1220" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dgreen1220">Dgreen1220</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331215/#Comment_331215" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-22T13:49:55+00:00" title="June 22, 2011  1:49PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2011 1:53PM by Dgreen1220.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Though I've described the game only working with two players, but I don't think that, mechanically speaking, it would only work for two.

I don't know if it would be interesting, but I think it would be hypothetically possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there is, somewhere in here, a way to have teams of fighters (tag-team?) or a hero (or team of heroes) against a crowd of faceless mooks.

I demand the best of you and you shall know only the best of me."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis fit with another line that I've had kicking around in my head: "rising up to the challenge of our rivals."<br/>\n<br/>\nI've got this idea that the crux of the role-playing part of this game will revolve around the players challenging each other and rising to that challenge. In character creation players would choose one other player to be their rival. These relationships might be unilateral (Player A and Player B are rivals) or all entwined (Player A is Player B's rival. Player B is Player C's rival. Player C is Player A's Rival). Player's rivalries might also be highlighted by an adjective (Friendly, Jealous, Spiteful).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hope is that your rival will set some sort of challenge for you, and that you will rise to that challenge over the course of play. This will undoubtedly tie your character growth/advancement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut how to pull this off...<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this becoming too blog-like?
