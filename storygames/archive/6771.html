But there are extra bits you can add that make combat much better: Stunts (DMG p. 42), Skill Challenges, and Cool Terrain Things. Let's talk about these and other ways to make battlemat fights cool.<br/><br/><b>Talk through the battlemat setup</b><br/><br/>When you're drawing the encounter area on the battlemat (or laying out dungeon tiles) talk through the various interesting features with the players, and solicit ideas from them.<br/><br/>"These are fire braziers. You can kick them over to burn adjacent enemies or throw someone into the fire."<br/><br/>"This ruler is the ship's yardarm. If you're standing next to it, you can swing it around 90-degrees to attack everyone in its path (STR vs. Reflex, 1d8+3)."<br/><br/>"These vines grow across the ravine. With an Acrobatics roll (DC 15) you can grab on and swing from vine to vine at your Speed +1. You're balancing, so enemies have combat advantage against you, but you have the high ground while you're up there, so you get +2 to attack rolls. If you fail the check, you can still swing across at Speed -1 and you don't get the +2 attack bonus."<br/><br/>"Those cargo bails should be hanging in nets, and they can be cut open to send the cargo crashing down on someone."<br/><br/><br/><b>Think about opportunities, not problems</b><br/><br/>Let's imagine a swaying rope bridge across a raging river. You might say that the bridge is precarious, so you have to make checks to keep your footing when you move across it, or you're slowed, or some other hardship. This is "realistic" but not very much fun. Instead think about the opportunities for cool stuff that the bridge provides.<br/><br/>Like, you get a +1 to Bull Rush attacks against people on the bridge and you have the option to push them over the side instead of just backwards. Maybe if you're at the middle of the bridge, you can deliberately shake it, making a STR vs. Reflex attack against everyone else on the bridge (and shifting them one square off the bridge if you hit). Now the bridge is a dangerous feature, but it's dangerous because of the opportunities it provides rather than hindrances that increase whiff.<br/><br/><br/><b>Add Skill Challenges with tangible rewards</b><br/><br/>The PCs are fighting a faction of Night Goblins they haven't seen before, so you throw down a skill challenge. As a standard action, you can study an adjacent enemy (Insight, Perception, and Dungeoneering are prime skills). If the PCs can get 6 successes studying before they get 3 failures, they'll learn a weakness in the goblin's fighting style. When they fight these goblins again in the future, they'll get +2 to damage.<br/><br/>During a fight with an Ogre, the PCs can attempt a skill challenge to determine where the Ogre's hidden treasure cache is. He keeps nervously glancing in its direction (Perception), he might spill the beans if goaded with trickery (Bluff, Diplomacy), and he keeps a special key on his belt that disables the traps (Thievery).<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Got any techniques to make D&amp;D 4e fights cool?

It's basically saying 'Do the thing I set up or you'll be doing something non optimal'. It doesn't feel very innovative to just do what someone set up.<br/><br/>What I'd think is good is<br/>1. You tell them there are things they can interact with in a combat, but not what.<br/>2. Those interactions are free actions, so they aren't wasting attacks/moves on what might be a pretty megre bonus.<br/>3. If the player interacts with the object, but not in the way intended to get the good effect, the good effect sill occurs. Make up a reason why. Players never kick the damn brazier over, they try and use it to blow flamable liquour from their mouth in a makeshift flamethrower or some crazy crap. Give them the bonus regardless of how they interact - if they think just hiding behind the brazier works, describe them bumping into it, it falls and applying damage to a foe. Make up a reason for something good to come from their exploration - don't expect exploration to be it's own pure reward (simulationists may spit on me now).<br/>4. If they interact exactly the right way, they get an XP bonus. This is to encourage intelligent exploration, not bloody minded poke everything in a wacked out way exploration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150698/#Comment_150698" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T01:48:21+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  1:48AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2008 1:54AM by John_Harper.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Callan S.</cite>It's basically saying 'Do the thing I set up or you'll be doing something non optimal'.</blockquote>\nNo, actually, it's nothing like that.

That's what the table on page 42 is for, after all.<br/><br/>I find that having the talk when you do the setup (especially the part about "solicit ideas from everyone") helps quite a bit. It's certainly not about prescribing the One Right Way to do things or any nonsense like that.

As GM you retain veto powers and you cna always mention 'there are no flaming braziers' or 'that was the only one, you can't do that again' it get just enough cool without losing too much control.<br/><br/>Same with a ship, they can assume there is rigging, cargo in nets, a yardarm etc. They counjure them into existance by needing them. Maybe let them spend an action point to get away with something unlikely... "I just out of the balcony onto the haycart below!"

Just throw down a bunch of complications and let them figure out how to deal with them.  I haven't really seen this in any of the published materials.  Like, for example:<br/><br/>- There's some archers on a ledge above this room.  You can take them out with ranged attacks, sure, but they'll sound the alarm and more archers will keep coming, generally being replaced at the end of each round.  However, luckily, the ledge only has room for about 3-4 of them to stand and fire at the same time.<br/><br/>- Meanwhile, the main goal is to get across the room, but the floor has fallen out.  What's left are a bunch of erratically-spaced pillars which are old and worn enough to give you a few good handholds, but jumping from pillar to pillar is going to be slow, and the archers won't keep firing.<br/><br/>- Add more complications here.  Maybe there are vampire bats which will erupt out of the abyss below, if you disturb them.  Maybe some of the pillars are old and will fall over if you try to hang from the side of them.  Maybe there's a large flying monster that will come out of the abyss once the players are halfway across the room.  Etc.<br/><br/>It's a puzzle with no clear answer, no set of tactics that will necessarily work perfectly or, at least, you haven't got one in mind.  Let the players figure out what they want to do.  Let yourself be surprised by how clever they are.<br/><br/>When it comes to skill challenges (not really on topic, sorry John) make them more like stunt challenges.  Present a challenge ("a crumbling spiral stairway that's been greased with what you can only hope is animal fat... and, once you start up it, the goblins will set it on fire"), but don't have the skills that characters will use to overcome it already in mind.  Let the players declare how they're going to surmount the challenge and THEN use the stunt table to work out what the rolls should be and what the consequences for failure are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150707/#Comment_150707" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T03:42:43+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  3:42AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff, Jonathan.<br/><br/>It's a key part of the rules that the players get to choose which skills to use for skill challenges.

What's your motive for building? Building for the sake of building clashes with any eventual gamist engagement (If your going for gamist play - I'm not saying you have to), because the players wont be be appreciative of building for buildings sake, they'll just be looking to win. It's like carefully making a cake only for someone to use it in a cream pie fight, so to speak. The motive for making it doesn't match the motive its used for.<br/><br/>Though, writing out the problem, what comes to mind is perhaps an organised few moments where everyone knows to just soak in the ambiance of the creation.

While, in the beginning, it may seem like the characters have a variety of options, over time, optimal ones will quickly emerge.  This means that straight-forward fights will gradually get less and less interesting, because the basic options don't really change, even at higher levels.  John (jenskot), who was involved in playtesting, pretty much confirmed this too.  This leads me to believe that, as Eric says, increasing the difficulty or number of opponents faced in an Encounter will not fight the degenerative effect.  It's still the same fight, just now with 100 skeletons instead of 10, or with Orcus instead of Irontooth.  This means you need other ways to maintain the initial excitement and sense of a wide variety of options.<br/><br/>I suggest:<br/><br/>1. <b>Making future encounters fundamentally different in nature, instead of just harder.</b>  Have encounters where the characters are trying to get away from an enemy way above their level, while level-appropriate enemies try to block their path.  Have encounters where the point is to delay enemies for a certain amount of time, not to kill them as quickly as possible.  Have encounters where killing people just makes the problem worse, where characters face a mob that will grow more violent in response to violence.  Have encounters where the point is to move a McGuffin from one place to another, where fighting is a necessary but secondary part of it.  Etc.<br/><br/>2. <b>Making drastic changes in terrain, or making the terrain itself dynamic.</b>  Nothing is more boring that playing the same fight in more or less the same room.  Fight on a frozen river as it's breaking apart.  Characters have to jump to land on large chunks as it collapses and then jump from ice chuck to ice chunk as they drift downstream at varying speeds.  Fight a battle on top of a dragon or other monster, Shadow of the Colossus style.  Fight while falling through the air, like Gandalf and the Balrog.  Fight on bridges or amidst buttresses.  Fight in a blizzard or hurricane where the wind involuntarily shifts the characters in the midst of combat.<br/><br/>3. <b>Pose mechanically impossible challenges that cannot be solved with standard rules or standard thinking.</b>  Force the players to stunt, basically, or otherwise do really creative things to triumph.  Say there's a gap too big to jump across.  Watch the fey-touched Warlock mark an enemy, the Paladin cleave them in half, and then the Warlock teleport across the gap as a cloud of mist.  Awesome!  Say your Wizard is trapped behind a barrier, in a caged death-match with a close-combat beast of a monster.  Will the Cleric and Warlord, for example, fight each other in a ritual duel of support, where each of their blows buffs or heals the Wizard, enabling him to triumph?  That kind of approach, I think, will keep things continually exciting, even when the players have their most effective attacks worked out.  In order to make less effective attacks relevant, you may need to put people in really bizarre situations, which suddenly makes lesser techniques seem more useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150724/#Comment_150724" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T06:56:04+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  6:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John K</cite>I'd say there is more room for innovation if you give the players a little directorship instead of explicitly placing fun objects on the map.

That's another good type of fun.<br/><br/>As a forinstance:  If the GM has said "There's a brazier full of burning coals here, at the top of this narrow staircase," it can prompt people more easily to something like "Oh, HEY!  I'm gonna tip the brazier up on one side and pour the coals down the staircase to discourage pursuit!"  Yes, people <i>could</i> say "Okay, I'm going to invent a staircase that they're pursuing us up, and a brazier full of burning coals, and then I'm tipping the brazier up and pouring the coals down the staircase, to discourage pursuit," but doing that unilaterally is a different action from both a social and tactical perspective than making creative use of the elements provided by another player (in this case the GM).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150727/#Comment_150727" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T07:41:47+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  7:41AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see a Codex page that hoards cool action-y bits to grab.

Every character gets a Minor Action every turn and drawing a weapon is now a Minor Action.  Now a character can draw and throw a dagger or javelin to cut the rope holding the chandelier, for example, without losing any time that might have been better spent with some more rote action (because they can re-draw their sword next turn with their newly available Minor Action).<br/><br/>Keep this in mind when building engaging combat opportunities; allow some of them to be "triggered" via only a Minor Action.  If they require a Standard Action with a moderate to difficult Skill check to pull off, the effect should be commensurate.  But some opportunities with a large effect might just be a matter of getting to the right square and using your "free" Minor Action.<br/><br/>clarification: throwing a weapon would of course be a Standard Action.

When you set up the battle, it's not just about cool things to interact with, it's about setting up a situation that's a puzzle and a sandbox. For example, if I'm being peppered by Kobold archers, I move, then charge, then beat them up. I don't have to think much about what to do. But if the kobold archers are further away than I can get in one move, or if there's a barrier that prevents me from charging, I have to start thinking about creative solutions.

Sure, there's the danger of putting forward something that's too ridiculous, that will definitely get you a TPK, but I think you should be okay with, um, "restrained impossibility."  Like the kind where the villain goes, "Ha ha, there is clear no way for you to top my vile and fiendish death trap," which is really just a challenge for the players to think out of the box.  If you actually build an escape-proof death trap, that's no fun.  But if you build a death trap with no clear avenue out, and don't have one in mind (you don't do, like, "hanging from the ceiling is a long rope, just out of reach" or put other strong hints in) players should still be able to find one or make one.

I'm trying to build my underground ex-dwarven city in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ico" rel="nofollow">the style of Ico</a>, so I want the whole thing to eventually open like a puzzle box, but a puzzle box that, unlike Ico, reacts strongly to the manner in which players approach it.  So choosing to sneak past the kobolds guarding the city gate, for example, might cause future ramifications.  Perhaps, after a few more encounters, that band of kobolds is now completely cut off from the rest of their allies, who've pulled back lower into the ruins, and wants to cut a deal with the adventurers, leading the characters down another narrative path.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150778/#Comment_150778" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-14T17:14:44+00:00" title="June 14, 2008  5:14PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thinking is that always coming up with off-beat encounter terrains and situations can be pretty creatively exhausting, and it would be a shame to ignore the resources already in front of you in terms of the MM. Now, I haven't read it or even glanced through it, but one would assume that there's enough options in there to throw the occasional curveball, especially by taking advantage of strange movement mediums (are Bulets (sp?) still in there? Landsharks!).<br/><br/>One of my favorite DM tactics back in the day was taking two non-related critters and figuring out why they'd be in the same encounter.

I've found the DCs to burst things with a strength check in the PHB, and page 65 of the DMG has tables with the hitpoints of objects, but I'm not seeing hardness. The closest thing is on the next page:\n<blockquote><cite>DMG page 66</cite>Object Immunities and <br/>Vulnerabilities <br/>Usually, it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of attack you make <br/>against an object: Damage is damage. However, there <br/>are a few exceptions. <br/> All objects are immune to poison damage, psychic <br/>damage, and necrotic damage. <br/> Objects don\u2019t have a Will defense and are immune <br/>to attacks that target Will defense. <br/> Some unusual materials might be particularly <br/>resistant to some or all kinds of damage. In addition, <br/>you might rule that some kinds of damage are par\u2010 <br/>ticularly effective against certain objects and grant the <br/>object vulnerability to that damage type. For example, <br/>a gauzy curtain or a pile of dry papers might have <br/>vulnerability 5 to fire because any spark is likely to <br/>destroy it.</blockquote>\nThat's the closest thing I've found to hardness. So... is a dungeon wall an "unusual" enough material to warrant an ad-hoc hardness? Because adamantine is on the page 65 table, and that stuff doesn't get a standardized hardness. Nor does stone get a standardized hardness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150826/#Comment_150826" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T00:21:31+00:00" title="June 15, 2008 12:21AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I just looked there, too.

Most NPCs you can't strike. You can only talk to them. Some you can strike or talk to. Others you can only strike. D&amp;D does not have that system, so that question is irrelevant. <br/><br/>In D&amp;D, targets break down into: you, an ally, you or an ally, an enemy, or a creature. Creature means that it can target anyone, friend or foe or the user.  And at least for Cleric, Healing Strike (Encounter) and all their at-will powers can be used against a Creature, which means it's quite alright for a Cleric to cast Sacred Flame on a Warlord ally to grant an ally Wizard temporary hit points. Since Creature also can mean "you" the Cleric could actually cast the spell on himself for the same result. <br/><br/>There might be other powers deeper in the tree that causes something similar the the WoW polymorph situation, but it looks like it would be a very esoteric problem. Basic attacks and many common powers look like they can target creatures, not just enemies. And Jonathan's puzzles seem to be well done ideas for creative application of the powers to utilize such game definitions as creature and ally and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151115/#Comment_151115" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-16T20:21:19+00:00" title="June 16, 2008  8:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2008 10:36PM by Eric.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I started enjoying D&amp;D a heck of a lot more when I stopped trying to make the rules make sense in terms of the world, and started making the world make sense in terms of the rules.

If the Warlord and Cleric are of the same or similar level and are fighting <i>right now</i> with blows that deal lethal damage, then they are a threat to each other <i>right now</i>. They might stop before they kill each other, and any given DM-controlled enemy might do the same by surrender or parley. They might also decide to make a heroic sacrifice and battle until unconsciousness or death to aid their teammate, just as any given DM-controlled enemy might fight until death.<br><br/>In the latter case, well, a person inflicting grievous harm upon their own person is clearly a threat to themselves under actual law and common standard - even if they're (pardon the phrase) "just cutting." And as with the case above, there's no way to tell at the moment that the harm is inflicted how the thing will end. So I'm having a hard time imagining a case where stabbing yourself in the gut doesn't make you a threat to at least yourself, if not others.<br/><br/>If the authors wanted to stop players from stabbing each other in the throat for buffs, they should have said "these powers only work when you hit a DM-controlled mob" - that would have simultaneously turned off the PvP flag, which might have been perceived as a feature given 4E's MMO influences. As it is, it only prevents the Bag of Rats trick and variants.<br/><br/>Again, empower me by saying yes to my mechanically-legal ideas <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151167/#Comment_151167" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T08:11:48+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  8:11AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smashing one ally in the face in order to heal another ally doesn't sound functionally different to me than the ability in some MMOs that allows you to transfer damage taken by an ally to your own character.

Here's the actual passage:\n<blockquote><cite>DMG page 40</cite><br/>When a power has an effect that occurs upon hitting a <br/>target\u2014or reducing a target to 0 hit points\u2014the power <br/>functions only when the target in question is a mean- <br/>ingful threat. Characters can gain no benefit from <br/>carrying a sack of rats in hopes of healing their allies <br/>by hitting the rats. <br/> When a power\u2019s effect involves a character\u2019s allies, <br/>use common sense when determining how many allies <br/>can be affected. D&amp;D is a game about adventuring par- <br/>ties fighting groups of monsters, not the clash of armies. <br/>A warlord\u2019s power might, read strictly, be able to give <br/>a hundred \u201callies\u201d a free basic attack, but that doesn\u2019t <br/>mean that warlord characters should assemble armies to <br/>march before them into the dungeon. In general, a pow- <br/>er\u2019s effect should be limited to a squad-sized group\u2014the <br/>size of your player character group plus perhaps one or <br/>two friendly NpCs\u2014not hired soldiers or lantern-bearers.</blockquote>\nThat is the entire section under the "Legitimate Targets" heading. If the conventional sense of the phrase "meaningful threat" doesn't convince you, the specific example of a bag of rats given in the text establishes the precise sense of the phrase here. Note that allies are only mentioned at all in the following paragraph regarding <i>number</i> of allies hit by the <i>effect</i> of a power that specifically mentions allies in the effect block, not potential legality of someone who is usually an ally as the target for a damaging power.<br/><br/>I don't care about the author's intent once the text is published. I care about what the text itself establishes. It's the only way I can actually play hard within the system: I have to have a finite set of rules that I can rely on to not change and which are subject to a minimum of interpretation based on a close reading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_151258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151258/#Comment_151258" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T19:17:35+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  7:17PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2008 7:37PM by Callan_S.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric, I agree with your approach.
