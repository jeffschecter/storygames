If so, what do you wish someone had told you beforehand?

I've run a few times and loved it.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.canonpuncture.com/?p=2109" rel="nofollow">Actual Play from Camp Nerdly 2012</a><br/><br/>There's a thread somewhere --edit--&gt; <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/14352/awsome-o-fy-puppetland" rel="nofollow">found it</a> &lt;--edit-- post Camp Nerdly 2011 where we talked over tips to make the game super-awesome.<br/><br/>I could have really really used two charts.  The first organized from left (slowest) to right (fastest) with each puppet in it's place.  And then one from left (weakest) to right (strongest) with puppets in their places.  Nutcrackers should be in this list too, and maybe Punch, but all of the Boys might crowd it up a bit.<br/><br/>-&gt; This game isn't simply a radio drama.  Yes, everyone is going to be communicating with "only" their voice, but make sure you still look your players in the face.  A lot of information can be transmitted there.  Don't play with a blindfold on.<br/><br/>-&gt; Be prepared to be interrupted.  People have things they want to do, and very little time to do it.  You will be talked over.  Try to help the "weaker voices" still be heard, but be ready to stop mid-sentence and take direction or feedback from players too.<br/><br/>-&gt; Don't hold back.  The puppets are strong, and your players are more creative than you imagine.  Make the game tense for them, and they will make it rewarding for you.  This means definitely give out black marks.<br/><br/>-&gt; Don't force the voices.  It's nice when you can vary your own tone or accent to make an interesting puppet, but don't go crazy with it.  Find the right mix of silly and serious, and be aware of the affect you have with your voice(s).  A simple change in vocabulary or speed is often just as good as a change of accent or pitch.  Use the one that makes you comfortable.<br/><br/>Keep us posted.  I'd love to look over a new edition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JohnScottTynes" title="JohnScottTynes"><img alt="JohnScottTynes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JohnScottTynes">JohnScottTynes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393778/#Comment_393778" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-18T10:37:36+00:00" title="October 18, 2012 10:37AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great points, thanks!

We always had difficulty coming up with an idea for a short adventure in the world.

Whatever they Can do, that's what another Puppet needs them to do.<br/>"Can sing a tune that helps the work along?"  Cool.  This puppet needs help motivating three lazy hand puppets to clear a path in the woods.  Also, once they get there, the Boys show up and threaten the operation...  etc etc.<br/><br/>But I also think there's plenty of room for basing things on the Puppet Cannots.  "Cannot tell a lie, even to spare someone's feelings."  Well, Judy needs you all to go and get supplies from a sympathizer.  This activity will require a great deal of tact, and some lies.  It should prove interesting enough, if you can push the Puppet into a choice of letting things to smoothly (and taking a black mark), or standing up for what he believes.<br/><br/>For me, it's much, much harder to come up with adventures without first knowing your Puppets.  Maybe the new edition can talk to that?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_393927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393927/#Comment_393927" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T12:00:43+00:00" title="October 19, 2012 12:00PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure why you'd want that.

"She found a clue..." Then mime turning a page, because on the next page of the story, the puppet is speaking, obvs.<br/>Timer on the table.

We never got that from first edition; our assumption was that she was way over there on the other side of the lake of milk and cookies, and we were here in Puppetland and were unlikely to ever meet her save as part of the climactic "resurrect the Maker" quest.<br/><br/>A list of one sentence "Once Upon a Time..." leads, like the setups for The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen, would help a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393973/#Comment_393973" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T14:54:51+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  2:54PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the times I've run it have been on the other end.

But there were also a few Puppets there to help."<br/><br/>I'm a bit out of my league, as all of the stories I've tried to tell directly involved the central struggle against the Boys and Punch, even if Judy isn't a central character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394017/#Comment_394017" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T18:08:01+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  6:08PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One other thing worth saying is that the owner of my FLGS actually sold me "Power Kill."

I fell in love with this game the moment I read the brief description.<br/><br/>Another +1 to using real puppets; I tend to enjoy games with that extra element to it, such as props.<br/>Another +1 to the use of the "turning the page" idea and using gestures.  Brilliant!<br/>Another +1 to a list of possible "Once upon a time" ideas, and kduos to mentioning Baron Munchaussen (another favorite game of mine)!<br/><br/>I always found the first game with wnew characters/players sort of awkward, as everyone was trying to find their voice or figure out how they were suppose to play.  I would suggest a "first story" that maybe didn't deal with the over all story so much, as with the puppets perhaps first meeting each other, establishing who is who, and maybe a lot of forshadowing of the darkness to come.  This could also be used to help everyone define certain elements of the main story as well.  Instead of filling in puzzle pieces, perhaps take a page from certain other games and let the first session fill out some of those "cans" and "cannots", etc.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, my greatest success with this game has been when I used it as an interlude to a Shadowrun game, where between each session the players played Puppet versions of their Shadowrun characters.  It kind of made me think of the "Welcome to Lodoss Island" sections of the Record of Lodoss Wars TV Anime.<br/><br/>I also think that using an oversized map of Puppetland, taylored perhaps by the storyteller and maybe the players, would add something to the game as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394327/#Comment_394327" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T13:08:42+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  1:08PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oddly enough, my greatest success with this game has been when I used it as an interlude to a Shadowrun game, where between each session the players played Puppet versions of their Shadowrun characters.

What you read was episode 2.  In episode one, we had the whole nervous jittering, kind of "what are the rules again?" table vibe.  People were there, people wanted to play for the first time, I wanted to run for the first time, and we were going through the motions for about fifteen or twenty minutes...<br/><br/>and then they got into a sticky situation with one of the Boys.  And Dave's puppet (who could put pretty much anything in his mouth) decided to swallow that Boy to save Asha...<br/><br/>Which is purely magical in Puppetland, because we can't talk about what that might mean.  Dave couldn't ask me what that would cost.  I couldn't ask how dark he wanted to go.  I couldn't poll everyone for ideas...<br/><br/>I was itching to take a dive into some dark territory, and it was like Dave stared at me with those wide, intense eyes of his and held a nail to his forehead, never breaking eye contact as he put the mallet into my hand...<br/><br/>So I went with it, and the table followed, and it was magical.  That's Puppetland.<br/><br/>I had bigger plans for the second session, but we were interrupted and cut short.  There may be a conclusion in 2013, who knows?<br/><br/>I'm glad you liked it.  But as you well know, I had little actual control over the events.  I'll have to diffuse your praise to the rest of the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439718/#Comment_439718" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-27T18:20:32+00:00" title="October 27, 2014  6:20PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arcdream/puppetland-the-storytelling-rpg-of-grim-make-belie/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arcdream/puppetland-the-storytelling-rpg-of-grim-make-belie/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439732/#Comment_439732" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-27T22:22:46+00:00" title="October 27, 2014 10:22PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Backed for sure.
