(<a href="http://www.gentechegioca.it/vanilla/comments.php?DiscussionID=1933&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Announcement here</a>)<br/><br/>I've held off on announcing this because it was very much a work in progress, but now I've been given the official go-ahead to advertise, so here I go!<br/><br/>Coyote Press, as you may know, have already done lovely translations of Covenant and Cold City, which have been very well received, and they approached me a year or so back about doing a new version of Solipsist for the Italian market. It was supposed to be out last year, but their busy publishing schedule forced it back a bit. However since the Autumn I've been busy supplying corrections and clarifications for the new book, which will include all of the errata and corrections, as well as some expanded rules sections and new artwork, as well as a new design that will show off Coyote's excellent layout abilities (so I'm told).<br/><br/>You can learn more about Coyote at <a href="http://coyotepress.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://coyotepress.blogspot.com/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito" title="Davide Losito"><img alt="Davide Losito" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.webinprogress.it/allyraid/badtoro2out.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito">Davide Losito</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260587/#Comment_260587" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-07T13:21:35+00:00" title="March  7, 2010  1:21PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2010 1:26PM by Davide Losito.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I confirm the book is in print and it will be introduced to the market at <a href="http://www.play-modena.it/" rel="nofollow">Play 2010</a> in Modena, this incoming week.
