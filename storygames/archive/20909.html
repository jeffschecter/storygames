On par with Sorcerer. There's a big list of spells to learn if you have a wizard, and a few extra things to keep in mind for fights, but otherwise straightforward. Note that it's been a while so I may not be remembering everything, but I also don't recall being confused particularly when running it.<br/><br/>Oh, and the adventure generation is very cool too, which reduces the GM's effort required significantly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458834/#Comment_458834" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-26T14:35:46+00:00" title="December 26, 2016  2:35PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran it at DexCon last summer. The session went well, I'd say, though I struggled a bit to really get the "feel" of combat down. I'd also slightly disagree with Mike about the spell list: everyone is a spellcaster, and while only wizards have access to the full list during play, even ordinary Knights need to pick and choose their spells. I recommend forcing non-wizard PCs to take one of the pre-defined packages of spells to streamline things.<br/><br/>The most experienced story-gamer in the group did swear an Oath and so we got to see those rules in play. So that was cool. The person with the most traditional and conservative mindset really struggled with the idea that there is absolutely no "plot," there is no "here is The Thing that is What You Must Do." At one point the guy speculated about exactly that: "Oh, this must be what we're supposed to do." And I literally just stopped the game and was like, "No, really. That isn't a thing. Do what you think your characters would do. That's it."<br/><br/>I really like the adventure creation rules. They're a bit quirky to wrap your head around simply upon reading, but in actual practice they're very practical and usable.<br/><br/>I think the greatest strength of the game is the way it communicates the social reality of its setting. In fact, the things that I was most worried about getting across were some of the things that went the best. Players really got into the idea behind their social class roles, and I felt well-prepared to explain some of the odder concepts of the setting (to a modern American steeped in more traditional RPG fantasy, anyway!): no currency system or even really barter, peasants as invisible to everyone but other peasants, petty warlord as the highest social class, etc.<br/><br/>The game received some mixed reception because of its inclusion of rape and torture as part of the setting. My personal view is that Ron did a great job of explaining the difference between including something in the <i>setting</i> as background versus including it in <i>your game</i>. He makes the point that no matter what is true about a game's setting, individual GMs and players are still responsible for making choices about what to include and not include. He takes a dim view of those who use the presence of such negative elements in a broader setting as an excuse to say that they are forced to include these things in their game out of "fidelity" or whatever. (This view, in fact, seems almost trivially correct if you consider games set in the real world: we play such games all the time without feeling forced to incorporate the worst elements of real human suffering.)<br/><br/>When I introduced Circle of Hands at DexCon, one of the things I did was explain that there is no X-Card, but that we are instructed to discuss if there are specific elements we don't want to see in play\u2014and I promptly vetoed sexual violence. I didn't feel like the aesthetic of the setting suffered as a result. YMMV, of course, but Ron really means what he says: go ahead and grapple with things that make you uncomfortable, but don't do anything deleterious to your mental health or enjoyment just out of machismo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458877/#Comment_458877" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-29T15:12:30+00:00" title="December 29, 2016  3:12PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a session and played a session.

It's been a while since I read the game, but my impression was that the PCs were basically Dogs from Dogs in the Vineyard: travelling problem solvers with a unique role in society that gives them leverage. I don't have the text in front of me to double check, so that might have been my interpretation. Perhaps their leverage comes mostly from being armed, but I seem to recall them being the only people who can use both the light and the dark side of magic.<br/><br/>I like how the game picks one time period and uses weapons and armor that fits that period, instead of the D&amp;D version to add everything from many hundreds of years of human history and slap it together. I also like that there's no currency, the descriptions of the different social classes and how it can even be beneficial to belong to the lower classes because you may get more support from regular people.<br/><br/>I bought the game recently (I only had the playtest version before), because I wanted to borrow a mechanic to my Whitehack OSR campaign. In combat in Circle of Hands, one side always has the advantage, from a round-to-round GM decision based on some explicit principles (more people to a side has advantage over fewer, longer weapons are better, if you do a lot of damage you get advantage next round, and so on). All principles are based on observable facts, and the text is clear that you can't just describe something to get the advantage. It's not enough to say "I jump on the table" to get advantage from higher ground this round; you have to earn the advantage as a result of your mechanical actions. In our current Whitehack game, one side always has combat advantage (+2 to hit and damage), but this advantage can shift from round to round depending on what happens. In Circle of Hands you also get more considerations for advantage if you know the area where the combat takes place, which makes it harder to just run around picking fights everywhere. If you fight the farmer in his barn, he will probably have the advantage.<br/><br/>Another neat thing is the description of unarmed combat and how it's not enough to to get your opponent to 0 HP (Circle of Hands doesn't use HP, but you get the point); when they are down you have to actually burn through their "HP" again to kill them.
