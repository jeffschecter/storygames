I really like the premise and think the game probably has some promise. But we really ran into a snag when playing and I'm wondering if anybody has dealt with this and figured out a way to make it work.   There is a section of the game called "Act 2: Exposition"  that gave us some problems; you are supposed to play the section in one single scene, but there is a ton of stuff to do in that scene and it just doesn't seem possible to do it well or naturally. Here is the section of the game they gave us problems:<br/><br/>"Acts two: exposition<br/> <br/>The first meeting of the society of dreamers <br/><br/>The first meeting is one single scene. <br/><br/>It's time for the group to find out which character is most likely the societies leader. Discuss briefly which character is most likely to spend time investigating mnemosites  and dream phenomena. That character will be the one first gathers the society.<br/><br/>The leader will be the instructor for the first meeting scene. Here, hear she officially forms of society. The player should take a few minutes to think about how to play it out. There are some things that need to be done: <br/><br/>A) Deside where and when.  This will probably affect the rest of the game. What European city are you in, and what time of year is it? <br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/>  decide the goal of the society: to find out more about the mnemosite, and you take action based on the facts you discover. <br/><br/>C)  describe a dreamer \u2013 A person you, the leader, knows is infected or possessed by a mnemosite. They're not present at the meeting! Defined out about the dreamer, draw a card from you stack to determine who they are \u2013 age, nationality, gender, profession. Instructor can discard one card and replace it with another, if desired. <br/><br/>D) unveiled the board. This belongs to leader in the society. How did you get it? From another society,  antique store, as an anonymous gift, as an inheritance\u2026? Make up a little story about it. It comes with a few pages of personal notes from the previous owner.<br/><br/>The board in the notes exist for the society mostly as a curious items. <br/>For the players, their game tool to set scenes." <br/><br/>The way I read this, The instructor is supposed to choose all these things and include them in the scene in which all the society members meet each other. Like I said above, this seems like too much stuff to fit into a scene and juggle and still make the scene natural; it also  leaves quite a lot of  major things up to the instructor, like the goal of the society. Has anyone had troubles running the scene? Did it really slow down the game? How did you handle it? Has anybody had any other issues with the game and how did you handle those?<br/>Any suggestions would be super appreciated :-) thanks :-)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460245/#Comment_460245" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T01:01:58+00:00" title="February 15, 2017  1:01AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, it's never felt like packing too much in a scene, simply because the scene is supposed to play out as a Society meeting.<br/>Some mandatory elements - introducing the Dreamer, unveiling the board - are easily brought up through the leader giving a briefing.

My group just kind of wanted to summarize the scene  instead of played it out,  so next time I'll push back against that.  It also doesn't help that the game is a little longer and our group tends to not like to play longer story telling Games, but I would like it just fine. Maybe I can get some people on board  to play some collaborative storytelling games which take multiple sessions; otherwise, we're leaving out a lot of interesting games.

It might be useful to think of it as "a one shot in two installments" rather than "a long-form game" (which, in RPG tradition, implies indefinite length and long-term commitment).<br/>The two- (or three-) installments "one-shot" has been a favorite format of mine <i>for scheduling games at home</i>, but I understand it's problematic for playing in a public space with people coming and going - when I was running a games club we only did actual <i>one-shot</i> one-shots (and we mostly played chamber larps, really). The key is <i>scheduling</i>: knowing that the exact same people will be back to finish the game. But by doing so in a public space you risk being unwelcoming to anybody who might appear uninvited, and that changes the tone of your event considerably - I <i>don't</i> recommend it, in fact.<br/>Maybe, if you have the numbers for that, make sure there's always at least one other table running an actually-one-shot game where anybody can join, before you set yourself apart playing a scheduled game over two installments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460255/#Comment_460255" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T10:32:34+00:00" title="February 15, 2017 10:32AM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also...\n<blockquote>My group just kind of wanted to summarize the scene  instead of played it out, </blockquote>\nWell, in that case I'd rather skip the scene outright and just go through the rules for it, deciding what needs be decided and informing players of whatever it is they need to know, OOC.

It may just be a group thing, or a personal thing, but that's just the impression I get given the groups reaction to  what happened when I read the litany of what it included. It might be helpful to hear an AP of that scene so that I have an idea of how it would all work, and maybe for the group to have that as well :-) The game really intrigues me and I definitely want to give it a lot of chances and I think those changes will pay off <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thanks for all the help :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_460285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460285/#Comment_460285" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-15T23:23:30+00:00" title="February 15, 2017 11:23PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's definitely a challenge!
