Jeff goes into the story of how he killed his wife's beloved vampyre character 20 minutes into a 2 year campaign. The game setup sounded cool with a supernatural vampire hunting swat team and lots of goodness, but the result...ouch. My wife's not a gamer, and now I'm thinking that might not be such a bad thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, the episode made me think of one of my GMing fiascos back when I was playing with my brothers and some friends. They were a bunch of kids from a farming village, one of whom was unbeknownst to them, the descendant of the ancient High King of legend. A Viking attack on their village had swept them into greater happenings as they begin to discover a great evil is working against the land, raising a monster invasion horde. At one point they step into the otherworld and are confronted by the King of Faery, who will bestow "items" upon them that will help them defeat the Dark Lord, but they can take no "gifts" from under the hill. They must win them by a challenge of...wait for it....Chess!!!<br/><br/>In my defense, I was really into chess at the time. OK, that's not a defense. Somehow I had forgotten how long and devastatingly boring a game of chess can be to those who are watching. One of my brother's friends rose to the challenge, we were both very deliberate (read "slow") players and the agony was drawn out as the entire game ground to a halt. Maybe if I had given the King of Faery a two minute chess clock the hell could have been over faster. Once the game began, I knew I had a problem because how do you speed up a chess game? Looking back with hindsight, I could have just pushed pieces out quickly, I mean it wouldn't be me losing it was the King of Faery...but if I had been that wise, I wouldn't have started the game in the first place.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103952/#Comment_103952" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-20T11:18:23+00:00" title="October 20, 2007 11:18AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>So in the last SoK episode (Congratulations on the 50 btw!!!)

I think it's brilliant that you called Jeff Paka, BTW.<br/><br/>I have a couple wife gaming fiascoes to share:<br/><br/>#1: My wife and I gamed together for the first time in college (we were dating at the time) as players in a VtM chronicle.  In our first game together, I made a Brujah and she made a young Toreador.  The ST informed her that her character was to be presented to the Prince as a full vampire during the first game.  But before the meeting, the coterie ended up running around in a graveyard for some reason I cannot recall.  When some Sabbat showed up, we hid her PC in a catacomb for her protection.  We then proceeded to have a running fight for the next few hours and completely left her behind.  So, she sat for the rest of the game, waiting for the PCs she just met to come get her out of a catacomb.<br/><br/>#2: I haven't killed my wife's character, but I set up a situation where her character's daughter was viciously killed (it wasn't my intent, but I didn't fight it).  When the guest player who was playing the villain struck the final blow, I still remember my wife, sitting on one side of the couch, leaning over another player to stare down the guest player who was sitting at the other end of the couch and screaming at him, "YOU BETTER RUN!!!!"  There was this pregnant pause as we all sorted out if she meant the player should run or if she was talking to the villain NPC.  Luckily, she was talking to the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103961/#Comment_103961" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-20T13:22:31+00:00" title="October 20, 2007  1:22PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>[snip] They must win them by a challenge of...wait for it....Chess!!!

[snip snip]</blockquote>\nThat reminds me of the sample chess challenge ladder in the Fate 2.0 book. If you beat the other guy by one you knock out a pawn, beat him by three and knock out a knight and so on. (The challenge thus didn't represent every move of the game, it was more of a highlight reel if you will.) You could win in a brilliant stroke by beating the opponent's roll by.. seven or so, I think, or could work up to the win by taking out the other pieces through smaller wins. I think that was the only time I saw a gaming system present chess in an appealing way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103967/#Comment_103967" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-20T14:35:32+00:00" title="October 20, 2007  2:35PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2007 2:35PM by John_Harper.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently played <i>In a Wicked Age</i> with my girlfriend.

We are young-ish. I won't say exactly. Old enough to know better, though.<br/><br/>The PCs are looking for the City of the Four Winds. It flies around somewhere way up in the sky, all cloaked in clouds so you can't see it. Long story short, they find a rope out in the wilderness that snakes away up into the air and supposedly leads to the famed city.<br/><br/>"We climb it!" they say. Some of you are already cringing. Oh man.<br/><br/>I flip to the climbing rules in the book. For some reason, god does not instantly strike me dead at this point. The climbing rules say that a successful climbing roll lets you climb 10 feet. If you fail, you're stuck where you are (and have to make other rolls to get going again). If you fumble, you fall.<br/><br/>The City of the Four Winds is over a mile in the air. Probably should'a been higher, now that I think about it, but sweet fancy moses, a mile was plenty. 10 GODDAMN FEET AT A TIME.<br/><br/>I really wish I was joking. I wish my players had simply punched me in the mouth and said no. But, no. We actually did it. We spent <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">most of the session</span> <b>all fucking night</b> making climbing rolls.<br/><br/>Later, when they were fleeing the city with Banes on their heels, the PCs discovered that they could not leave the city while carrying any of the artifacts they had found. They looked at me, with murder in their eyes, and said, "We. Climbed. All. The. Way. Up. Here."

TORG.<br/><br/>I loved reading TORG, was obsessed with it, so at some point I decided to run a session of it with some friends (I think I was 14 or 15?). And Aaron. Aaron was a long time aquaintence, and friend of my best friend. This was one of my first sessions as GM, and I had the adventure all prepared and ready to go, I just needed some friends to come over, make characters and throw down. So IIRC, it was me, Drew, Anne, Kim, Greg and Aaron.<br/><br/>I carefully explained the world, how it's all these COSMs at war with each other, and they can choose the cosm that they come from. We had a ninja, a werewolf, a secret agent.<br/><br/>And Aaron decided that <b>he wanted to be a living magical table that could throw exploding silverware</b>.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Me, being a novice and confused GM, and wanting deep down not to cock block anybody, came up with this strained explanation about how he came from the magical world of Aysle, how he was transformed by magic into a table, and how some Dwarves of light crafted him some weapons to defend himself with until he could turn back.<br/><br/>Basically, the adventure went in circles, a lot of confusion, and the game ended that day. Some of it was because I bit off too much. But most of it was because I had to chase Aaron around and keep him from ruining things (for the other players) with his magical damned table and its heat seeking exploding silverware ("I attack the wall." "I attack Kim. No not her character, Kim herself. I throw silverware at the screen, and it passes through into our world, hitting Kim.", etc)</blockquote>\nI also learned that day early on that no game is awesome enough to get a dickshank in a position from mocking the game into enjoying the game. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104194/#Comment_104194" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T14:27:17+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  2:27PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Andy.

And there was another thing I did that my homies still (justly) deride and mock me for. I made a homebrew game about immortal wizards and their politics throughout history, set in the modern day. You got to choose how old your wizard was, and which eras he/she had lived through. If you took an old one, you got a whole lot of skill points, but each batch had to be spent on skills exclusive to that era, representing what you were doing back then. So if you'd been, like, a beekeeper in the middle ages, you had to spend points on medieval beekeeping. And if you'd been...er...a Roman legionnaire, you had to spend all these points on marching and mass-formation combat, and erecting pallisades in an hour. None of which would ever come up in game. And there were quite a lot of eras.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least one player took over <i>eight hours</i> to make his character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game ran for about 5 sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104464/#Comment_104464" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T21:32:07+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  9:32PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Patiently record everything you will never, ever use in play."<br><br>Yeah.

I did do something similar as a player--missed out, without notice, on a session of this long-running campaign with some extremely frustrating issues. A session for a new game had been set up at a conflicting time after some scheduling confusion, and I simply forgot about the time conflict. Or maybe I'd blocked it out of my mind. Afterwards I apologized to the GM and never darkened the doorstep of any of his campaigns ever again. I guess voting with one's feet is a valid way of quitting a game, though it's even better with prior notice. :P\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>They were very decent about it and chatted to me afterwards. I took the train home with one of them and he explained what I'd done wrong.</blockquote>\nI actually thought of something like that--a gamemaster's workshop. The way I saw it, experienced gamemasters often don't get enough play and inexperienced ones are unsure of themselves. An inexperienced GM, then, could run some sessions with experienced gamemasters as players, then get feedback after the fact. There would be a sort of safety net in that it's a learning experience: The GM isn't necessarily expected to do well, nor do the players have to feel reserved about saying what they didn't like since everyone is there with the express understanding that feedback is welcome. <br><br>One GMing fiasco of mine was during my second time gamemastering, back when I was pretty spine-challenged and just didn't know how to speak up. There was this obnoxious player who refused to interact with the other characters, for the (what I now recognize as a ridiculous) reason that "my character is antisocial." The other two players and I couldn't stand the guy but didn't want to confront him. <br/><br/>The guy kept going off from the party on his own little plotlines--and I, new to this gamemastering business and anxious to please, duly gave him the screentime and drama he wanted. Thankfully not all the screentime, but I really should have ignored him rather than pander to his selfishness. <br/><br/>These days I would have told him, if he wanted to play an antisocial character we could work out some reason for him to work with the others. If not and he wanted to split from the party anyway, he could sit out and watch the rest of the party. Or better yet, leave. Ah, the benefits of hindsight and growing a spine.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104643/#Comment_104643" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T14:30:30+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  2:30PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This isn't a fiasco so much as my favorite bad session.

They were die-hard D&amp;D players, so I usually had one or two characters that would wander in and out of their ongoing campaign. The GMs wife also played in the group, and she tended to bully her husband on in-game events, making him re-roll or re-think parts of the storyline if it went against her character.<br>\n<br/>\nThey also played high-level campaigns, and her and another player had a bad habit of settling down and setting their characters up somewhere, like a town or village, and basically ruling instead of adventuring, which would have been fine if the GM weren't hell bent on everyone adventuring.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring one session the GM had bandits attack his wife's character's ranch, setting buildings on fire and killing all of the female horses so she couldn't breed them. The idea was for us to learn a rival baron had sent the men and for us to go and confront him, leading to the larger adventure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe married couple then proceeded to have a drawn out argument over how many horses a group of 8 bandits could kill in X number of turns and could they make the necessary skill rolls to target only the mares. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot kidding you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give you an idea of how this ground the session to a complete halt, I had a box of HeroClix with me, which no one there played or had any interest in, and the other players spent the night going through the pieces and asking me what the game stats on the dials meant. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, the wife declared that she would send her guards with my character to go to the Baron's fort while her character tended to the wounded animals and the mage (another PC) would stay behind to fortify the ranch. So it was basically me and 12 NPCs that actually left for the real adventure. I didn't come back to play for a couple of months.<br/>\n<br/>\nME                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104832/#Comment_104832" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T10:43:50+00:00" title="October 25, 2007 10:43AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chaldfont</cite>I once let a player convince me that he could use a wish to obtain one of every magic item in the Dungeon Master's Guide except cursed items and artifacts.
