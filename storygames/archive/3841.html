I've been thinking about this game and I've identified some common problems I've observed with it.  I thought I'd throw up these observations for comments and analysis.<br/><br/>Pacing.  There is a problem that is most prevalent among people who have played The Roach before although it can happen among overly enthusiastic first time players who are familiar with the game through reading others accounts.  What happens is everyone remembers the awesome of how a game of The Roach *ends*; usually with lots of whacked out creepy ritualistic murder and mayhem.  Then when they go to play a second game, eager to get back to that mayhem, they *start* the game at that high level of wacky mayhem and then wonder why the game peters out by the second event.<br/><br/>Solution: Start small.  Frame scenes and conflicts around relatively ordinary things such as that dispute over departmental budgeting or that pesky student who thinks they deserve a higher grade.  Even if you are roached in the beginning go for creepy rather than violent; make inappropriate comments and invade personal space rather than sacrificing the head master on the convocation dining table.<br/><br/>Character.  I occasionally see people make characters with absolutely no redeeming value what so ever.  I think this stems from the notion that the point of the game is to demonstrate how the unroached character is almost the same as a roached character.<br/><br/>Solution: While the suggested notion above is partially true I think it ultimately makes demonstrating how an unroached character is NOT like a roached character all that more important.  By the end of character creation players should have some sympathy for their character.  It helps if a character cares about obtaining something understandable (if petty) for understandable reasons (if misguided).<br/><br/>Unfortunately the game itself doesn't really provide much structure or guidance with these two problems.  I was wondering if a) anyone else had encountered these or similar problems, b) my proposed solutions sound reasonable and c) anyone had any suggestions on how to facilitate these solutions while playing the game?<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86189/#Comment_86189" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T12:49:36+00:00" title="August  7, 2007 12:49PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are great observations, Jesse.  The game can suffer (heh) from the "wide-open gonzo narration" problem you sometimes see in GMless games for sure.  I've definitely seen both problems you identify, and I support your solutions 100%.  I think communication will go a long way - just pointing out these common difficulties before play will be helpful.  Challenge people to keep their Roached-ness as subtle as possible for as long as they can.  The cards will do the work of making it pretty public soon enough.  <br/><br/>I have not seen the character problem quite as often, and as a player I really try to <i>give </i>this to other players - it's absolutely acceptable to provide another player's character with an errant step-child, or a keynote speech to write, or a grant to receive if only the committee from Washington misses certain irregularities.  If you tie these into a character's enthusiasms, the player is usually thrilled to play along.  I gave a really satisfying "gift" in a recent game, where an un-Roached  character was given the choice of losing her University tenure offer or committing murder.  The player squirmed and found a really awful, creative solution that re-affirmed her character's shaky humanity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86203/#Comment_86203" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T13:08:15+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  1:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, I haven't seen either of those problems.

Which is harder in the earlier phases of the game since there really isn't anything on the character sheets to tell you what they care about.  The closest thing is the Enthusiasms but nothing specific like the manuscript they want published or the hot co-ed they're trying bed.<br/><br/>Plan B is to pick one the named NPCs, assign it to a player and attack something that NPC cares about where what that NPC cares about is something you, yourself just invented.  The pitfall of this approach is that the assigned player will drop the ball and in the worst case scenario the conflict entirely, "Oh what?  Yes, Yes, you're quite right Professor, quite right."<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>P.S. I've read The Roach Returns courtesy of Mr. Josh Bishop-Roby.

You can also invent the hot coed they lust after out of whole cloth, right down to the lust they didn't know they had until you made it an issue.  Assign a fat d10 to the coed, hand her to a sympathetic player, and hope she ends up on your side.  <br/><br/>I hope you get to run Darker!

It can only lack tension -- though, for those looking for a <i>House of 1000 Corpses</i> freak-fest, it'll all be right there.<br/><br/>If I'm not mistaken, the rules contain no mechanical tension for humanity (or whatever you want to call it), so its simply up to the players.<br/><br/>It seems to me then you can get a mix of results depending on the group:<br/><br/><i>Crazy Ass Amoral behavior on a cartoon level is fun, and everyone at the table is enjoying it, so it works.<br/><br/>Everyone brings a tension of compassion and amoral desires, and since the group is on the same page, it works.<br/><br/>Different people bring different things to the table, so people start going... "Hmmmm. What are you doing?"</i><br/><br/>This is self-regulated by the players, so I'm not sure exactly how to hard wire it into the session. Character creation is the first step though. As leader (if not GM) of the group, part of your job will be to help establish the kinds of protagonists you think will work well in the game.<br/><br/>(If there's things I'm missing about the game, I apologize, and would live to hear more about them.)<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86253/#Comment_86253" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T14:12:59+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  2:12PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>If I'm not mistaken, the rules contain no mechanical tension for humanity (or whatever you want to call it), so its simply up to the players.</blockquote>\nOther than the endgame conditions, that's true.

That was the focus, that was the fun, and the Roach made that fun part all possible.<br/><br/>I don't really remember hearing much about the end.... about winning. About staying free of the Roach.

But I've seen them in other games I've played and in the notes of others' play as well but usually to a lesser degrees.<br/><br/>The way I usually present the endgame condition is like this.  I mention that the game has a win condition which is that the player with the most reputation and who is unroached "wins."  But then I emphasize those quotation marks pointing out that the game is unfair and that anyone who puts winning and learning how to win first will be let down by the game.  So perhaps the way I'm doing that is de-emphasizing the win condition as a whole rather than changing perspective on what purpose the win condition serves.<br/><br/>I don't recall ever saying that the focus of the game was "wacky mayhem."  I usually say the focus of the game is academic satire which often devolves into extreme versions of collegiate eccentricity and pranks resulting in wacky mayhem.  Which works better in the later stages of the game but if you dive in too fast and hard you have no where to go. <br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86280/#Comment_86280" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-07T15:02:22+00:00" title="August  7, 2007  3:02PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jesse,<br/><br/>I have a whole raft of questions now about the win conditions and such.

Here's what I see as the central points of the endgame.<br/><br/>1) You can voluntarily become roached.<br/>2) You become roached if you draw a roach card 1 in 10 chance.<br/>3) You can not become unroached unless you draw another roach card and cross off an enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Remember you only draw cards at the top of an event.  So that's 6 cards total over the course of the whole game.<br/><br/>So you see, the win condition is mostly random.  If you do not draw another roach card before the top of the last event or if you are unroached and DO draw a roach card at the top of the last event there is NOTHING you can do to "win."

People who play hard to win end up disappointed one way or another.  Either they do really well and get kicked in the nuts by a late random draw, or they do really well and find out that winning isn't all that fantastic after all, and that they could have had more fun if they hadn't obsessed over it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>3) Since the win condition is highest advancement without having the roach, according to the mechanics, shouldn't I simply use the Roach as fast and hard as possible to advance, and then hope I dump it in time (randomly) to pick up the win?</blockquote>\nThat's one way to play.

The cards are structured to promote this (good commands are paired with bad opportunities, for example).  The dice are structured to promote this (Roach dice dominate, obeying commands dominates, supporting class war by tailoring conflicts to your status dominates).  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>5) Or, am I missing something, or many somethings, and if so, what are they?</blockquote>\nI think you've got it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86593/#Comment_86593" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T12:12:54+00:00" title="August  8, 2007 12:12PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 12:22PM by Jesse.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I just had a light-bulb go on.  Consider life without the Roach.  The win condition would simply be the player with the most Reputation.  But that's just everyday life at Pemberton.  That's the "game" of academics. <br/><br/>Now consider the fact that this game has an optimal strategy.  Full Professors should get into conflicts about Status with Assistant Professor PCs.  Assistant Professors should get into conflicts about Everything Else with Full Professor PCs.  This is optimal because it will both gain you points and cost them points.  A slightly less optimal strategy is for Full Professors to get into Status conflicts with NPC students and for Assistant Professors to get into Everything Else conflicts with Luminary NPCs.  This maximizes your gain potential but costs your opponents nothing.<br/><br/>Enter The Roach.  The Roach doesn't care about your petty game of tenure and reputation it has larger incomprehensibly Lovecratian designs.  The Roach literally removes you from the game.  And that's the irony of The Roach: it makes you the best at a game you're no longer playing.  The comedy is that the characters still think a roached character is playing their power struggle game and thus must step up to meet this "new strategy."  It's like a bunch of people suddenly trying to house rule Clue to beat their friend who's playing Monopoly at another table.<br/><br/>Here's the real punchline though: This puts players with Roached Characters in a position of judgment.  Because they are no longer playing the game they can step back and decide just whose day they're going to fuck up and why.  That's where the "moral" choice in The Roach lies.  It's not in the decision to be roached or not but WHEN you're roached who bears the brunt of your torment?  And when you're unroached how far are you willing to go to compete in a game whose rules you suddenly don't understand anymore?<br/><br/>Makes sense?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86596/#Comment_86596" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T12:16:18+00:00" title="August  8, 2007 12:16PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome.

Jesse, I'm looking at your notes in your first post, thinking about the game last year, and this is what I came up with:<br/><br/>I don't want to be told that it's an academic satire. Or, rather, that's not going to help me one lick. There are several reasons for this:<br/><br/>1) I need clear "entry" points to things like RPGs. (or movies, or whatever). When we say, "This is what the game is about..." or "This is the focus..." or "Here's how you start..." I"m looking for that seed crystal that's going to let me <i>grow out the game from that point</i>.  By focus on genre ("satire") and results ("wacky mayhem") and environment ("academia") as that seed crystal, I get confused. Because now we're heading toward Sim-land -- not Nar.<br/><br/>2)  It turns the game into an abstraction, and not about people. If Ron is right about it being a game about judging the characters, and Jason is right about it being about how the characters behave, then I (simple-minded man that I am), what the first and primary focus to be <i>the characters</i>.  I don't want to hear about satire and wacky mayhem, because, as Jesse points out, everyone's going to rush for that. Why? Because if the game is described as being focused on "academic satire which often devolves into extreme versions of collegiate eccentricity and pranks resulting in wacky mayhem" then why wouldn't I go for that stuff right away? After all, that's the focus of the game!<br/><br/>3) But if, instead, the person leading the game (not the GM, but the "leader" of the session), were to day, <b><i>"This is a game about a group of ambitious academics,</i></b>" I would be plugged into the game right away.  Because that I get. That's human. because I don't want to sit back and judge the characters. I want to be engaged with my character and judge.  <br/><br/>4) I believe the emphasis on the setting ("It's academia! It's crazy!") is a red-herring -- both as an into to the game, and in discussions.  You could easily and happily run games of: Roach in the Vatican, Roach in The West Wing, Roach at Warner Brothers.... and the game would play great.  You'd switch out the stock characters from Roach with foreign dignitaries, personal assistants and young theologians and so on, and the game works just fine.<br/><br/>5) Because the game isn't about the setting. It just isn't. It's about the petty games people play for their sense of -- entitlement, self-worth, status, what have you -- which for right now I'll sum up under "ambition."<br/><br/>6) The setting, the wackiness, and so forth will all come about, of course. Jason does a great job in the rules of plugging the character into the academic life.  And the craziness will simply come about because of the rules -- the cards, the commands... I mean, it's just there! The game will force that. The players don't have to force that. If they create an academic with ambitions -- and actual person who they could actually believe in -- once you get that going, and have that person and the rules meet, comedy and strangeness will ensue. <br/><br/>7) For this reason, I think giving instructions on holding back on pacing, starting small and so forth put the focus in the wrong place. At least for me, anyway. Because it's still all about "where we are going" and it's still about that abstract thing we're making, but it's not about the <i>characters</i>.  <br/><br/>I was just watching the second season of <i>Twin Peaks</i> a few weeks ago.  I hadn't seen it for years.  And what struck me was that while I remembered everyone talking about the wackiness of the show, the truth is that while it is very funny and wacky, it's really quite grounded in the experience of human beings. There were scenes that brought tears to my eyes -- just a father talking to his son about his dreams of happiness for him, for example. <br/><br/>Without that you get -- well, you get the second half of the second season, after Laura's killer is revealed and David Lynch had moved on, and you really got the feeling that writing staff said, "Well, the audience keeps talking about that bad hair morning Cooper had -- so we need more small town satire with wacky mayhem."  And so we got all the crazy, but it was ungrounded and the show fell apart.<br/><br/>8) I think The Roach is the same way. If there are not real, solid, empathetic characters I can get behind, then the wackiness doesn't matter. But instructions for how to pace and play <i>later</i> won't help me (<i>me</i> at least) if I don't start off on the right foot.  The right foot for me is, "The focus of this game is on a group of ambitious academics."  Issues of humanity and situation are introduced right away, and it gives me a hook as a human being into the game.<br/><br/><br/>Jesse, I hope you understand I'm not parsing your language to say "Gottcha!" -- but because I'll be running a few games in a few weeks and these things matter to the games I'm going to be playing and running. And phrasing those few key words at a Con where those few words set tone and style are really crucial.<br/><br/>At the game we played last year (and I know there are other sessions and reports, I'm just talking about the one I know) I didn't get any sense of investment in the characters.  When I spoke once to Ron about the events in the game he said, "It sound like everyone forgot about humanity."<br/><br/>I'd agree with that. And I"d say focusing on characters everyone can actually invest in first is the way to kick off the session. Once you add the rules, my guess is a lot of these other matters will fall by the wayside or take care of themselves.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86709/#Comment_86709" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T15:04:30+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  3:04PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Christopher,<br/><br/>Oh, I totally get where you're coming from.  I think my personal problem with *presenting* the game is that I'm very, very, very personally invested in the setting.  I LOVED my professors in college as little eccentric bundles of human curiosity.  The professor who always brought his five year old to the lunch room because no one ever notices the five year old who darts ahead of the line and snatches an item.  The professor whose house I visited and found an entire wall of cabinets filled with nothing but bran cereal.  The professor who was literally carted away by the police because he showed up to class, turned all the lights off, shone a flashlight in the students faces and verbally abused them.  The professor who specialized in Artificial Intelligence but drove a manual transmission car because he, "didn't want the machine deciding when to switch gears for him."<br/><br/>Maybe.... just maybe they were possessed by a mind controlling roach.  And that makes me smile.<br/><br/>That's what excited *me* about The Roach.  The opportunity to play THOSE guys I loved so much and poke a little fun at them.<br/><br/>You mention the idea of alternate settings.  Indeed The Roach Returns contains a version called Overlord which moves the game to a WWII setting.  I have zip, zero, nada, not one itoa of interest in playing that version of the game even though the engine is the same, "people with ambition."<br/><br/>Which brings me to my main point.  I think we agree on what the engine of the game is, it's just that when I present it I tend to forget about the engine because I'm so personally hyper-enthused about the particular chassis the engine happens to be in.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86720/#Comment_86720" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T15:18:15+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  3:18PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>The professor who was literally carted away by the police because he showed up to class, turned all the lights off, shone a flashlight in the students faces and verbally abused them.</blockquote>\nJesse's role models, folks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86724/#Comment_86724" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T15:22:05+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  3:22PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 3:22PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/><br/>Which brings me to my main point.

(Though I can't wait for a few years from now when <i>The Roach Ultimatum</i> is released.)<br/><br/>As for this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The Roach really demands a strong facilitator, just because of the way it is structured.  In that way authority is slightly, ever so slightly uneven.</blockquote>\nI don't know how this can be avoided.  There were a few threads over on the Forge detailing that the role of "GM" is actually many roles that can divided among several people. And even in a GM-less game, some of these roles are going to have to be distributed and and taken.  A facilitator that helps set the tone and agenda is vital for any game. I have no idea how you could have an RPG that reaches a perfectly even authority.<br/><br/>It sounds as if this bothers you somehow -- as if the fact that it's not perfectly even is a failure of some kind.  It isn't. It's just the way things are.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>it'll work in any hierarchical power structure.

Color <i>does</i> matter, and that one seemed so easy and hot i thought, "Now that I'd want to play."  And then I thought of <i>Roach in the West Wing </i> and the thought of inverting Sorkin's well-meaning staff and showing the dark underbelly that ended up on the cutting room floor cracked me up.  And then the Hollywood structure is just rife with this stuff...<br/><br/>This sounds like a good move.
