It's the setting of most of the classic Zatoichi movies. Anyway, in my area they have some famous hot springs resorts, namely Ikaho, Kusatsu and Minakami, three smallish towns that focus on nothing than the most exquisite act of enjoyable bathing.<br/><br/>Many REAL conventions, like educational conferences, trade shows, etc happen at these kinds of places. People go, they arrive and immediately change into their hotel yukata (kimonos/robes), they hang out with friends, they go to the hot sprigs, they come back to the spacious banquet hall to eat a gorgeous dinner of locally grown area specialty foods, retire to the large communal rooms (8-12 people) for beer and chatting and social games, more hot springs, sleep, a wonderful breakfast, more hot springs, more communal area stuff, then return home.<br/><br/>I found out that the major Japanese game convetion, "JGC", happens at a large hotel in much the way described above, but WITHOUT the hot springs (no hotel that big, no onsen that close to Osaka that can cater to it).<br/><br/>My dream was to rally the Tokyo JIGG gamers and all go up to the mountains for a weekend, and basically have a small 20-30 person convention at a hot springs resort. Like a "Camp Nerdly", but in the lap of utter luxury. Gaming, bathing, electric massage chair, more gaming. Perhaps gaming WHILE bathing (I imagine a mechanic where you see how many seconds you can stay in the Cold Water Bath before you jump out), wonderful dinner and sake, wonderful breakfast, relaxing ride back by bus or train to the city.<br/><br/>It never happened, though: The price tag of $150-300 for one weekend was just to high for the average Tokyo-ite gamer. Plus, I had a feeling that some of the Tokyo crowd had never been to a hot springs resort, so didn't fully appreciate the possibilities of using one as a gaming mini-con.<br/><br/>It's still a sort of dream of mine, but as I don't live in Japan, and few others do too, I'm not sure if it's possible. Maybe some time next year when I come back to Japan for vacation, a couple Tokyo-ites could get together for some hot springs gaming; 4-6 people instead of 20-30.<br/><br/>What is your dream gaming convention or outing? Playing in a particular or unique place (old church, Seattle Space Needle, IKEA)? Playing under particular circumstances?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81924/#Comment_81924" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T22:55:34+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 10:55PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, I would SO spend the money to go down to Tokyo to combine two of my favorite things: Onsen and Gaming.<br/><br/>My <i>ideal</i> convention though, is on a zeppelin, which tours the globe, picking up gamers from even the most remote loactions, making for the most cosmopolitan convention ever seen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81925/#Comment_81925" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T23:03:44+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 11:03PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A weekend of gaming at the Ahwahnee Lodge at the bottom of Yosemite Valley.

Second dream: the opposite.<br/><br/>Seriously, after the NBP, I fell in love with the intimacy of "we're just a bunch of nerds playing games and not making a business out of it" combined with that sense of just being outside typical civilization that you get with campaign.  It's unfortunate that our coasts are so far apart.<br/><br/>I told my local friends about some awesome play I had there, specifically: while four of us were playing Polaris, Paul &amp; I as the moons for another character (I want to say Christina's, but maybe Nancy's), we were making fog with our breath because it was that cold.  The other day, one of my friends suggested that four of us rent a cabin up in Tahoe, drive up, play in a game of Polaris around the cold &amp; snow, crash there and then drive back.  While that's not a "dream con" per se, it's a "dream session" that came out of my con experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
