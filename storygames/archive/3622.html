So Camp Nerdly, Go Play, etc are expensive for me.  (But I think I'm going to save my pennies and go to the next Camp Nerdly.)  And blew my GenCon money on going to my brother's wedding in San Francisco.<br/><br/>So, here's the problem.  I tried running <i>Dogs In the Vineyard</i> once, and it was a big flop.  I didn't like some aspects of the dice system, but there was other stuff involved, including a group of more or less passive players who wouldn't engage the town.  Having watched conversations for awhile, I think my biggest problem was with stakes-setting.  I was so excited about playing it, and I really <b>wanted</b> to like it, but it just fell flat for us.<br/><br/>Dogs was the first indie game I tried.  And is still the <b>only</b> indie game I've tried, despite the number of them I own now.  My experience with Dogs has made me gun-shy of these non-traditional games...  I <b>want</b> to try them, but I don't feel like I have the right experience for running them for a group of people with my own experience.  It's the blind leading the blind.<br/><br/>I would really like to give Dogs another try, but with a group of experienced players. My ability to travel to any conventions this year is very limited but I'd be willing to drive a ways to play a game.<br/><br/>So here's what I need.  I live in Wichita, Kansas... pull up Google Maps, and we're right there in the middle of the nation-scale map.<br/><br/>I could drive to Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, or Joplin. If someone were willing to put me (and maybe my wife) up for the weekend, I might be able to go as far as Dallas or Omaha, maybe even St Louis or Denver.<br/><br/>I'll drive five hours, maybe even six or seven under the right circumstances, each way to give this game another chance, but it's got to be a group that has experience with the game (i.e. make it really worth my while to drive that far for one game). Good food and good conversation outside the game would entice me further.<br/><br/>Optionally, start a Go Play event within driving range, guarantee me a game of DitV, and I'll guarantee I'll do everything within my power to come, and to support you as much as I can.  (My powers of organization are not to be taken lightly.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81383/#Comment_81383" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T23:34:39+00:00" title="July 15, 2007 11:34PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You only need to drive to Lawrence. It's the hub of progressive gaming in Kansas. Seeking out the KUGAR club at KU would be a good start,  I think. Started by Gareth Skarka back in his college days, the group still meets on Wednesday nights in the Student Union from 6 PM to 11 PM.

A bit north of Oklahoma City.  I'm in much the same boat as you, except I haven't even played Dogs in the Vineyard a first time.  It was the first of many story-games  bought and never played.<br/><br/>(Edit: Heh, I just realized you might think I'm joking.  No, I really live in Stillwater, and I really want to play Dogs.)<br/><br/>Right before I moved here from Omaha, I <i>almost</i> convinced my D&amp;D group to play Don't Rest Your Head.  Although I've never GMed anything before, not even D&amp;D, Don't Rest Your Head made it look easy, so I wanted to give it a try.  But a GM from a different D&amp;D group announced a gestalt campaign to which everyone was invited.  So much for that.<br/><br/>And Stillwater...  Well, the main game shop went out of business just a few months ago, right before I got here.  It seems the only other real roleplaying going on here is some White Wolf LARP club.  Going off their highly codified website, I get the impression they are a bit fanatical.<br/><br/>So, yeah, if there are a few story-gamers around this area that would like to meet up as a group, that sounds great.  I'm a lot going-on-broke right now, so my gas budget is limited and my entertainment budget is infintesimal; but meeting on a weekend or something would be fun to do at least once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ravenx99" title="ravenx99"><img alt="ravenx99" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://raven.phoenyx.net/mutterings/pics/userpic_micro.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ravenx99">ravenx99</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81433/#Comment_81433" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-16T08:33:03+00:00" title="July 16, 2007  8:33AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Burr</cite><br/>(Edit: Heh, I just realized you might think I'm joking.

Having grown up Souther Baptist, and Kansas being more "Old West" to me than Utah, I can totally see doing the Baptists thing. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote><br/>Right before I moved here from Omaha, I<i>almost</i>convinced my D&amp;D group to play Don't Rest Your Head.

I wasn't sure I could get the whole feel right.  Then I watched Gaiman's "Neverwhere" (yay, Netflix) and it all fell into place.  Fred says DRYH is the Dark City RPG... watching "Dark City" a second time didn't help me.  DRYH is very much the Neverwhere RPG.\n<blockquote>So, yeah, if there are a few story-gamers around this area that would like to meet up as a group, that sounds great.
