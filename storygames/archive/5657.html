I had a bunch of Indie Games there I could run.  Great Ork Gods was the game most demanded and the only one that the same group came back to play for a second time.  Not Dogs in the Vineyard.  Not Capes.  Not TSoY.  Not Burning Wheel.  Great Ork Gods.<br/><br/>The game takes about 5 - 10 minutes to set up and start playing.  This includes character creation.  If the players are really slow.  In fact, if a player takes more than 10 minutes to make a character he automatically gets penalized.<br/><br/>The game has a HUGE whiff-factor.  Unlike other games, this is a feature not a bug.  Whiffing is fun in Great Ork Gods.  Orks who succeed a lot garner the anger of the gods.  The gods don't like uppity orks.<br/><br/>If you're in the mood for an amusing game, GOG is an awesome choice and it's free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126568/#Comment_126568" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T11:54:08+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 11:54AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran it once, years ago, long before I knew or cared about any of this "indie game" business.  Unfortunately, I don't remember how the mechanics worked out in detail.  I can, however, say that it was a lot of fun!  It was completely absurd.  In addition to men, elves and dwarves, the orks fought a vampire rabbi, and a circus of rabid halflings.  It was my first time running a game without prep.  My brother, who is a reluctant gamer at best, liked it so much that he ran it for a bunch of friends of his, who were not gamers at all.  They had fun too.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOrks die frequently, but no one minds.  Even in basic d&amp;d, people get attached to their fragile characters and then become upset when they die.  This is not the case in GOG.  That is not say that people don't get a bit attached to their orks, just that character death was funny and enjoyable, rather than frustrating and demoralizing.  Similarly, being frustrated by the will of the fickle gods was also amusing rather than aggravating.  You should give it a try; it's a very low-stress game, and it makes people laugh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126584/#Comment_126584" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T12:21:02+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 12:21PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marhault</cite>1.

You want your ork to do well (see above for caveat) and so you fling Hate (a mechanic) at other orks when they act. Their players inevitably return the favor. Goblins are basically "ork fanboys" whom you narrate as taking punishment in your stead, to avoid said punishment (basically, hit points that get underfoot and squeal a lot). Your adversaries (well, other than the other orks and the gods) are "typical" adventurer types a la D&amp;D: elven bowmen, dwarven axemen, big dumb jock barbarians, pencil-necked wizards.<br/><br/>I have yet to play--the rules have been taken offline in anticipation of publication--but I was in there at the start with a lot of advice and tonal inspiration (the above "rule 1" and the gods' names and some mechanics). Not all of it was taken, though--I recall wanting Loot effects (basically, "found" Traits) and wanted experience (Oog?) to be useful somehow. I think the Loot thing got dropped, for some reason (didn't fit? Orks don't get Kewl Loot, maybe?); and he opted for Oog to be, literally, just a score, like in an arcade game: functionally empty, except for gamist bragging rights.<br/><br/>And I have JUST emailed him today, to shake the tree. If he's stalled on production issues, I've volunteered to finish them up for him. Otherwise, we just have to wait and whine (that's y'all's cue: go email him, too!).<br/><br/>I'll buy it the day it's released.<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126599/#Comment_126599" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T12:40:08+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 12:40PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, the history (Forge search WORKS, today, wow!):<br/><br/><a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=8741.0" rel="nofollow">Initial Design Post</a> - Wow... uh, I forgot I'd gotten a bit testy about how "rules-lite" it was becoming ("rules-contemptuous?"--a clever pejorative, but way off-base).
