I have no doubt at all that they'll be completely jazzed by the idea of playing through a TV season - they're all fans of <i>Battlestar Galactica, Lost, Alias</i> et. al. But I'm wondering how good a fit the second edition rules will be for their gaming sensibilities.<br/><br/>I'd be grateful if any PTA fans one here could share their experiences of seasons they've run or played in. What worked? What didn't? I'm especially looking for ideas about rules hacks that you used.

This makes a lot of sense in terms of suspense and incentive to bid for narration rights.<br/><br/>Another way to play is to enlist the whole group in setting "if I lose"<span style="color: #CC0000;">*</span> before the cards are drawn.

The downside, that narration rights only win you the ability to put your personal spin and color on a predetermined outcome, haven't seemed to me to be much of a downside at all, in practice.<br/><br/>It also produces more of a writerly, story-workshopping vibe, which you may or may not want.<br/><br/><span style="color: #CC0000;">*</span>and often in suggesting refinements to "if I win" too                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307445/#Comment_307445" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-08T12:34:25+00:00" title="January  8, 2011 12:34PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/>\n  If I were to tweak anything, it would be to put fanmail in the center before we started the first scene.<br/>\n  And then try and get people in the habit of spending fanmail.

Worst case scenario from my anecdotal experience is that someone will tune out because they don't feel like there's anything tangible attached to the talking. A lot of games have ways you can turn a bad situation to your advantage through strategy - PTA doesn't, really. The cards fall and dictate outcome and narration, and that's it.<br/><br/>Encourage them to be awesome. A lot. Point out awesome things as a good time for fanmail if you see someone react to it, until they get into the habit.<br/><br/>Talk through drilling down to the real heart of a conflict. Issue is a stat. It's not a conflict when one guy wants to keep another guy from getting away. It's a conflict when one guy wants to keep another guy from getting away <i>because he doesn't want to look like a failure to his partner</i>.<br/><br/>Most of my PTA rules hacks have been coming up with more formalized, mini-game ways to do the pitch session, 'cause some groups I've played with have needed some constraints to kickstart them. I've tried squishing together resolution systems from other games to make various Franken-PTAs for various reasons, but I wouldn't recommend it. I learned a bunch, but that all came to nothing.<br/><br/>So, yeah. Play it as it lies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307471/#Comment_307471" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-08T17:38:29+00:00" title="January  8, 2011  5:38PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2011 5:38PM by PaulCzege.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We mis-read the game text and it became our favorite house rule: <i>you can't get fanmail if it's not your scene</i>.

Obviously the first thing out of my mouth is "in a home game, we would be putting a pitch together ourselves, if you have ideas about this pitch, hang onto them and we'll talk about them".<br/><br/>Example: Curtains, the horror-comedy set in a haunted 19th century Parisian theater.<br/><br/>I have around 10 or so character ideas (for a 4-5 person table) which I put on index cards and I spread them out face up. I say "these are some characters that might appear in a show like this, if any of these spark any other character ideas, let me know." Normally I don't expect many people to suggest anything at this point, if they do, be super enthusiastic about it, but don't expect anything.<br/><br/>Example: Theresa, the diva, M. Beauchemin, the producer, Jacques, the tortured writer, etc.<br/><br/>We then discuss which character's we're most excited about. We do NOT pick characters until we have a cast assembled.<br/><br/>I pass out the character sheets. It has the name and concept. I then lay out, face down, many many many index cards filled with Connections and Traits. Everyone chooses 2-3, and picks one. If they really don't like either, they can draw again. The point is to create a general universe of what Traits and Connections are like.<br/><br/>Then they write the final 2 Trait/Connections themselves.<br/><br/>Basically this process is to step people through the biggest blank-spaces of PTA, starting with "I'm telling you what the game will be" to "here's some ideas for how the game might be" to "what are your ideas about how the game might be".  This also allows us to do two episodes in one 4-hour convention block, which shows people what Spotlight Episodes are and what Screen Presence does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307656/#Comment_307656" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T10:50:31+00:00" title="January 10, 2011 10:50AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2011 10:51AM by J_Walton.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD speaks wisdom. That's very close to how the setup works in Geiger Counter and Fiasco, and the more focused pitch process in those games is a direct descendant -- from what I know of JMS' play experiences -- of a LOT of brainstorm-style PTA pitch sessions that were mediocre-to-good.  Having the producer come to the table with concepts that the players can then tweak and/or choose between is super great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_307660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307660/#Comment_307660" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T10:56:31+00:00" title="January 10, 2011 10:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2011 10:57AM by Remi.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>But hashing out the pitch is the coolest part!</blockquote>\nThe Pitch isn't play. It's table setting. If that's the best part of your PTA game, you're in a lot of trouble. My advice would be find a way to get The Pitch done in under an hour. If you're playing five sessions, the players will find the empty spaces and fill them in, with play. Better to get into the game and learn how to set up scenes and drive towards meaty conflict than spend three hours rooting around to find an airtight pitch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_307665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brenton" title="Brenton"><img alt="Brenton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brenton">Brenton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/307665/#Comment_307665" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-10T11:32:49+00:00" title="January 10, 2011 11:32AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Definitely go to read some of the actual play help threads in the Dog Eared Designs archive at the Forge.  There are a lot of problems which groups tend to run into during their first times playing, some of which you'll probably have, too.  The things I had problems were remembering that the Producer frames every scene (the other players only request Focus, Setting, and Agenda) and working to set good stakes with conflicts.  It takes a little practice to make stakes that work well and are fun.<br/><br/>Go take a read; you'll probably realize a lot more than we can suggest with blind comments here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
